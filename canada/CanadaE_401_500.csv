A solemn moment of silence. The world over, this is the traditional response when lives are cut short by tragedy. 
It has also been a common response to tragedies in Europe and off its shores which have ended the lives of thousands of refugees and migrants. Not killed by bombs in Syria, but killed while making terrifying journeys in search of safety and better lives in Europe. 
But the scale and rapid succession of these tragedies calls for breaking the silence. 
In the space of a week, along with people across the world, I recoiled in horror as four new tragedies added to a growing list of events that have already brought a record number of refugees and migrants to untimely deaths this year. According to UNHCR, 2,500 have already perished en route to Europe since 1 January 2015. 
On 26 August, 52 bodies were found inside the hull of a ship about 30 nautical miles off the coast of Libya. 
On 27 August, police in Austria discovered the corpses of 71 people, including children, crammed inside a truck left abandoned at the side of the main highway between Budapest and Vienna. Police have told media the dead are believed to have been Syrians and apparently died by suffocation. 
That same night came news of yet another tragic shipwreck off the coast of Zuwara, Libya in which up to 200 people may have died. 
And yesterday, a shocking photo of a drowned toddler washed up on a Turkish beach hit global headlines, bringing the crisis into even sharper focus. He and his young brother, believed to be from Kobane in Syria, were among at least 11 people believed to have perished when their vessel ran into trouble as they tried to reach the Greek island of Kos. 
The nature of tragedies is that they are usually rare and happen unexpectedly, to ordinary people who find themselves swept up in extraordinary circumstances. The past week’s horrors were neither unexpected nor singular. 
People dying in their dozens – whether crammed into a truck or a ship, en route to seek safety or better lives – is a tragic indictment of European leaders’ failures to provide safe ways to reach Europe. That it is now happening on a daily basis is Europe’s collective shame. 
n Vienna last week, not far from where police made their awful discovery, European Union (EU) leaders were meeting with key EU Member States and western Balkan countries. Despite not being on the initial agenda, the treatment of refugees in the region quickly took top billing. 
And with good reason – earlier in the week Amnesty International had reported from Macedonia’s southern border with Greece, where up to 4,000 refugees became trapped when Macedonia closed the border. Paramilitary police units blocked the border crossing with razor wire and fired stun grenades at shocked families who had fled the war in Syria. 
My colleague met a mother of four children from Damascus who clung tightly on to her youngest son amid the booms of stun grenades nearby: “This reminds me of Syria. It scares the children; I never expected to find that in Europe. Never; never,” she said. 
Further up the Balkans migration route in Hungary, police this week fired tear gas inside a crowded reception centre, and Hungarian authorities are in the process of erecting a razor wire fence along the border with Serbia to prevent more refugees and migrants from entering. 
And Amnesty International has recently visited both Kos and Lesvos, Greek islands on the frontline of Europe’s refugee crisis. Overloaded, under-resourced authorities are failing to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people arriving on the island – 33,000 on Lesvos since 1 August alone. As a result, thousands of people, including many Syrian refugees, are staying in squalid conditions. 
All these crises are symptoms of the same problem: Europe is not accepting its responsibility in an unprecedented global refugee crisis. It is failing to create safe routes for refugees that respect the rights and protection needs of people with the dignity they are entitled to. 
So, what can be done? No more moments of silence – we’ve had enough of those. It is now the time for leadership. 
European leaders – some of them, at least – seem to be getting the message. 
At the Vienna summit, the calls were less about Fortress Europe and keeping people out, and more about solidarity and responsibility. 
Vice-President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini could not have been clearer in her remarks at the end of the meeting. Europe, she said has a “moral and legal duty” to protect asylum seekers. 
The right words, certainly. But they now need to be matched with action. 
Amnesty International has been calling for this Europe-wide approach for years, but recent events prove that it has never been more urgently needed than now. Could we be reaching a tipping point? 
European leaders at all levels must step up and provide protection to more people, better share responsibility and show solidarity to other countries and to those most in need. 
At the very least, such a response should involve a significant increase in the resettlement of refugees – current proposals pale in comparison to Turkey’s hosting of 1.8 million Syrian refugees – more humanitarian visas and more ways to reunite families. 
Anything less would be a moral and human rights failure of tragic proportions – something we simply cannot be silent about.

I welcome today’s announcement by the RCMP to lay criminal charges against Colonel George Salloum who was directly responsible for my torture while I was detained at the Palestinian Branch of the Syrian Military Intelligence. 
Since I launched my complaint in 2005, I gave the RCMP investigating team, during the many interviews I had with them, the information they needed to advance their investigation. This lengthy international investigation took the officers overseas to gather evidence. As a result, they were able to better understand the nature of interrogations in Syrian detention centers. Upon their return, the investigators were able to pass on their knowledge to other RCMP staff.  
I believe this is vital for the RCMP to grasp given the increased urge to share information even with regimes who don’t respect our understanding of basic human rights. 
It is important to emphasize that while this criminal charge is only with respect to my case, Colonel George Salloum, was directly involved in the torture of others including Canadian citizens. 
This is by no means the end of the road. It is my hope that George Salloum will be found alive, arrested and extradited to Canada to face Canadian justice. 
The laying of this charge comes at a critical point in our history. Canada has lost much of its credibility within the last decade when it comes to supporting important human rights causes. It is my hope that Canada gives high priority to eradicating torture and bringing those who commit it to justice. 
Enhancing national security and protecting human rights can go hand in hand.

,  
I welcome today’s announcement by the RCMP to lay criminal charges against Colonel George Salloum who was directly responsible for my torture while I was detained at the Palestinian Branch of the Syrian Military Intelligence. 
,  
Since I launched my complaint in 2005, I gave the RCMP investigating team, during the many interviews I had with them, the information they needed to advance their investigation. This lengthy international investigation took the officers overseas to gather evidence. As a result, they were able to better understand the nature of interrogations in Syrian detention centers. Upon their return, the investigators were able to pass on their knowledge to other RCMP staff.  
,  
I believe this is vital for the RCMP to grasp given the increased urge to share information even with regimes who don’t respect our understanding of basic human rights. 
,  
It is important to emphasize that while this criminal charge is only with respect to my case, Colonel George Salloum, was directly involved in the torture of others including Canadian citizens. 
,  
This is by no means the end of the road. It is my hope that George Salloum will be found alive, arrested and extradited to Canada to face Canadian justice. 
,  
The laying of this charge comes at a critical point in our history. Canada has lost much of its credibility within the last decade when it comes to supporting important human rights causes. It is my hope that Canada gives high priority to eradicating torture and bringing those who commit it to justice. 
,  
Enhancing national security and protecting human rights can go hand in hand.

One of the most unexpected and consequential phone calls I ever answered was back in September 2002.  A woman who introduced herself as Monia Mazigh was calling with a request for Amnesty International’s assistance.  Her husband Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen, had disappeared in US custody while changing planes at JFK Airport in New York City on his way home from a family vacation in Tunisia.  
 Monia said to me, I do not know what accusations they are making against him.  All I demand is that they give him justice. 	  
  
Neither of us would have imagined that it was the beginning of an epic, history-making struggle for exactly that, justice.  And that the struggle would continue for so long such that almost thirteen years after that phone call, Maher and Monia’s quest for justice continues to make history. 
Today the RCMP did something that has never before been done by a police agency in Canada.  In fact it has almost never been done anywhere in the world.  Canada’s national police force laid criminal charges against Colonel George Salloum, a Syrian military intelligence officer who stands accused of carrying out and overseeing the torture of Maher Arar while he was illegally imprisoned in a Syrian jail cell between October 2002 and October 2003. 
Canadian law has allowed for the possibility of foreign officials being charged for torture in Canadian courts since 1985 in a variety of contexts, including when the person who has been tortured is a Canadian citizen.  However, thirty years later this is the first time that charges have been laid in Canada for torture happening outside the country.  That lack of action is symptomatic of the secrecy and impunity that has long shielded torturers around the world.  The groundbreaking decision to lay charges lifts that secrecy and pierces that impunity. 
An exhaustive two year public inquiry headed by the respected Ontario judge Dennis O’Connor concluded in a 2006 report that there was no truth to allegations that Maher Arar had any connection to terrorism.  The inquiry also found that those unfounded accusations, passed on to US officials from Canadian sources, led to him being sent off illegally to face torture in Syria.  
The Canadian government did apologize and offered compensation.  But there has been no progress towards justice in either the United States or Syria.  Until now. 
The RCMP doesn’t know where George Salloum is, or whether he is even still alive.  However, through Interpol and other police channels, efforts will be made to find him so that he can be extradited to stand trial in Canada. This offers justice directly and very personally to Maher, Monia and their families.  More widely it sends a strong message from Canada to torturers in other countries that what happens in torture chambers there may end up before the courts here. 
  
The charges come after an exhaustive, unprecedented ten year investigation.  Amnesty International assisted the RCMP throughout and we welcome this tremendous development.  After a decade it might feel as if this is a wrap.  Far from it. We will watch closely now for the following important next steps. 
First, obviously, George Salloum must be found.  Amnesty International will press other governments to cooperate with Canadian officials towards that end. 
Second, investigations in the Arar case should continue, leading to charges against other Syrian, US or even Canadian officials if appropriate and feasible.  There has yet to be any accountability in the United States for subjecting Maher to rendition. 
Third, there are other cases ripe for investigation under the same torture provisions in the Criminal Code.  Other Canadians have been tortured abroad.  Their torturers should be pursued.  And there are foreign nationals in Canada who stand accused of having committed torture elsewhere before travelling to Canada.  They too should be investigated. 
Fourth, three Canadians whose cases are hauntingly similar to Maher Arar’s – tortured in Syria around the same time and almost certainly by some of the same officials – have been denied justice at every turn; and that must at long last give way.  Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin’s cases were examined by a judicial inquiry conducted by former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Frank Iacobucci.  His 2008 report confirmed they had been tortured and that the actions of Canadian officials had played a role.  Rather than receive an apology and compensation they find themselves trapped in a protracted and contentious lawsuit.  Given this ground-breaking decision to lay charges against George Salloum it is certainly time to deliver justice to these three men.  
Fifth, the RCMP’s charges powerfully affirm that torture is a crime, plain and simple.  It cannot be explained away by raising national security or any other excuse.  Yet at the same time Canada tolerates or condones torture, including through deportations and our intelligence-sharing relationships.  Reforms are needed to ensure that torture has no place in Canadian law, policy or practice.  
And finally, these charges help lift the secrecy that is often a torturer’s greatest ally.  George Salloum is no longer lurks in the shadows.   His misdeeds will quickly become notorious. Governments around the world will be on the look-out for him.  Canada can take one more important step towards ending the secrecy that fuels torture by ratifying an important UN treaty that sets up a system of inspecting prisons to look for the conditions that lead to torture, so that it can be prevented and ultimately ended.  
Ironically that treaty, the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, was adopted by the United Nations in December 2002, while Maher Arar languished in a Syrian prison cell and George Salloum was free to torment him and countless other prisoners.  Syria has not signed on to the Optional Protocol’s prison inspections.  But neither has Canada.  Canada cannot press Syria or any other country to get on board until we have done so ourselves. 
Monia Mazigh’s phone call thirteen years ago unleashed a remarkable struggle for justice.  Neither she nor Maher have wavered.  Nor can the rest of us.  Not until torture is a thing of the past.

,  
The view was staggering upon my arrival in the village of Idomeni, near Greece’s border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia). 
,  
Up to 4,000 refugees, many of them from Syria including many families with children, were trapped after Macedonia’s government designated the southern border just outside the town of Gevgelija a “crisis area”, closing the border crossing and bringing in military backup. The refugees were all trying to pass through Macedonia on their way to northern European countries. 
,  
It looked like nothing I had come across before. About 1km from the border, Idomeni’s tiny train station was overcrowded with refugees who had already slept there for several nights. Many others were also sleeping rough in the surrounding area, out in the open and exposed to the heat and rain. Families including children as young as a few months old were crammed into small tents dotting the landscape that was filling with mud. Soaked and exhausted, they wanted to know if the police would let them cross the border that day. 
,  
Walking along the railway line from Idomeni’s train station towards Macedonia, the border was unmistakable as it came into sight. On the Greek side, a crowd of refugees, including many children, were waiting behind a line of hastily installed barbed wire. On the Macedonian side, groups of anti-terror police stood wearing body armour and were supported by military and riot control vehicles. 
,  
 
,  
A short distance from the barbed wire I met Zaha (name changed) from Damascus, Syria, who is around 30 years old and had fled with her four children and other relatives. Zaha stared towards the border as she sat in front of a very small tent that was sinking into the mud. She told me how she and her family had crossed to Greece via Turkey and were rescued by the Greek coastguard when their boat sank in the Aegean Sea. Unable to cross the border to Macedonia, they had already been stuck in squalor in Idomeni for four days. 
,  
As Zaha introduced me to her children and an elderly female relative behind her, explosions sounded along the border. Zaha reached out and wrapped her arms firmly around her young son. 
,  
“This reminds me of Syria. It scares the children; I never expected to find that in Europe. Never; never,” she said. She jumped with each new explosion – stun grenades fired by the Macedonian police to push the refugees back from the border. I counted more than a dozen over the course of the day. 
,  
She continued: “Before the war, life in Syria was paradise… If it wasn’t for the war we wouldn’t have had to come all the way here… We were trying to get on with our lives but then both sides started taking our children to fight and bombs started falling on our heads.” 
,  
 
,  
The elderly lady behind her showed me the wounds she had sustained on her feet during the journey from Syria to Idomeni. 
,  
“With the war we lost everything, our houses, our children all gone. All we’ve got left is them,” she told me, pointing at Zaha and the children. 
,  
A few metres away, another family of Syrian refugees were rushing towards the border – two young men, their father and their mother, who was seven months pregnant and visibly exhausted. She had already been hospitalized for a few days on the Greek island of Lesvos and now she was here trying to make it to Macedonia and beyond. 
,  
They told me that it had been almost two years since they fled Damascus. 
,  
“I lost a parent to the war and when famine kicked in we had to flee,” the woman said. 
,  
We hope our children can live in peace and go to school,’’ said the father who had worked as a building decorator back in Damascus. “We have family in Germany and we want to go there.” 
,  
They hurriedly continued towards the border, in hopes of making it through the barricades. 
,  
A few minutes later I was walking back towards the train station when I heard the boom of more stun grenades. I froze, instantly thinking about the heavily pregnant woman heading towards the explosion. I cannot fathom why anyone would want to throw a stun grenade at people like her and her family. 
,  
 
,  
Activists had sounded the alarm early on that the dire conditions around the border crossing near Idomeni would turn to a large-scale crisis, but their warnings fell on deaf ears. Months ago, Amnesty International already documented how refugees and migrants were routinely subjected to unlawful push-backs and ill-treatment by the Macedonian border police. 
,  
Aid workers from the medical NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières, and other NGOs and volunteers were doing their best to provide assistance to the thousands of people staying there in squalid and unhygienic conditions. What touched me deeply was the strong solidarity of many people from the local community, which has alleviated some of the suffering and might even have saved lives. Several locals transferred injured or ill refugees to the local hospital. This solidarity is in stark contrast with the conspicuous absence of official state support. 
,  
The following day (23 August) the Macedonian authorities did an about-turn and opened the border, allowing all the refugees to cross. Most of them boarded buses and trains to continue their odyssey towards the Macedonian-Serbian border and beyond. 
,  
I left Idomeni with the deep belief that we should be extending a helping hand to these war-weary people in their hour of need. Now is the time for solidarity, not barbed wire and explosions – they have had enough of those.

Three months after her most recent imprisonment, she wrote this personal letter from jail on what it means to be apart from her children. 
  
I was not allowed to hold my son Ali and my daughter Kiana when they were born because of my poor health. I was only able to see them through the door of the hospital room. It seems as if their fate was to be apart from me from birth. When I held them for the first time, all the scars from the caesarean, the difficulties I had breathing, the fear of death and all the pain were forgotten. I had become a mother. 
 
My dear Kiana was ill and had just returned from hospital when officers from the Ministry of Intelligence came to arrest me. My dear Ali was crying. I placed him on my lap and sang him a lullaby until he fell asleep. Kiana was distressed. I held her. I kissed her. I asked her, “Kiana dear, why aren’t you sleeping?” She said, “I’m not sleepy, I want to be in your arms.” 
	The officers told me that we have to go. I tried to separate Kiana from myself. She had used all her power and energy to hook her arms around my neck. She was crying loudly. I slowly went down the stairs. I heard her say: “Mother Narges, come and give me a kiss.” I returned and gave her a kiss. This happened three times. I was listening to the crying sound of my child who’s dearer to me than my life. Separating myself from her tore my heart to pieces. 
I was placed in solitary confinement in section 209 of Evin Prison, Tehran. It was a torture chamber for a mother separated from her ill child. 
It was near sunrise. My dear daughter, who would always give the loudest kisses, gave me a kiss on the cheek. I felt her warm body and her small lips on my cheeks. It was Kiana. I opened my arms to hold her close to me. I opened my eyes, it wasn’t Kiana. I cried for so many hours. I cried to a point where I thought my tears would soon run out. 
The security forces broke the door and entered my house. Kiana was sitting on my lap with her little arms around my neck. She was scared and was holding on to me tightly. Ali was extremely excited. He was following the officers and was constantly warning them, “do not touch my stuff”. He would call Kiana and say: “Kiana come and see, Mr. Conehead is trying to steal our things.” 
	They took [my husband] Taghi down the stairs. They closed the door and Kiana’s sweet and innocent face rested on the concrete step. She lay down and continued to cry. 
Security forces came to take me to the Ministry of Intelligence. Ali was running around holding his yellow toy gun, saying he wanted to come with me. My dear Kiana held the corner of my dress and said, “Mother Narges don’t go“. With difficultly, I separated myself from the children and left the house while hearing the sound of them cry. I then got in the car with the officers. 
On 5 May 2015, my dear Kiana and Ali went to school at 7am. At 8:30am the security forces were waiting outside the apartment door. They said: “Open the door, you have to come with us.” They took me to the general women’s ward of Evin Prison. 
	Ali and Kiana left Iran on 17 July 2015. During their last visit, Kiana said: “Mother, while you’re not around we’ll go and stay with Taghi until you join us.” Ali said: “Mother will you not get sad?”, and then looked at me to see my reaction. I tried to portray my happiness without any doubts, so they wouldn’t be worried about me. 
My dear Kiana and Ali will soon leave and I will be away from them for a while. Dear God, I used to look forward to Sundays and visiting days. On Sunday mornings I would rush around the prison section. I would gain energy after hearing the sound of the children and feeling their loving presence. 
	In my head, I started to talk to my children: “Dear Ali and Kiana, you have every right to leave the country where its leader does not recognise your rights and your world. How many times will they hurt your small yet innocent hearts and watch you cry as you’re separated from your mother or father? 
“I don’t know, maybe you will feel more comfortable and at ease if you live in a society where the love and relationship between a mother and her children is valued and understood, even if I am not there beside you both. I know this separation will be difficult, but I cannot bear to see your tears, fears and insecurities. 
“I would do whatever was in my powers to protect you from any hurt. Oh dearest of the dearest, please forgive me. The deprivations that the government aimed to impose on me were more so imposed on you. The two of you have faced more suffering in the first eight-and-a-half years of your life than you could possibly imagine.” 
I’m looking at the clock now and Ali and Kiana’s flight has taken off. And I, a mother in pain who is tired of hurt and suffering, has stayed behind. My heart has been torn into hundreds of pieces. My hands – without even trying – face the sky. 
	Dear God, please take my hands and give me the patience I need. For a long time, I won’t be able to see their innocent faces. I won’t be able to hear their voices. I won’t be able to smell them while holding them in my arms. Oh God, my arms feels so cold and empty without the presence of my children. My hands move towards my chest which feels as if it’s on fire. My cheekbones burn from the tears that run down my face. The lava flowing from my eyes feels like fire from the depths of my heart. 
 This blog is taken from a letter from Narges Mohammadi to the Prosecutor General of Tehran in July 2015, in which she also demands better treatment of women in the prison. Since her children left the country, Narges has not been allowed to speak with them on the phone.

The recent explosions that apparently destroyed a 2,000-year-old temple in the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria were yet another grim example of how the armed group calling itself the Islamic State (IS) uses conventional weapons to further its agenda. 
But what has fuelled the IS’s growing firepower? The answer lies in recent history – arms flows to the Middle East dating back as far as the 1970s have played a role. 
After taking control of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, in June 2014, IS fighters paraded a windfall of mainly US-manufactured weapons and military vehicles which had been sold or given to the Iraqi armed forces. 
At the end of last year, Conflict Armament Research  published an analysis of ammunition used by IS in northern Iraq and Syria. The 1,730 cartridges surveyed had been manufactured in 21 different countries, with more than 80 per cent from China, the former Soviet Union, the USA, Russia and Serbia. 
More recent research commissioned by Amnesty International also found that while IS has some ammunition produced as recently as 2014, a large percentage of the arms they are using are Soviet/Warsaw Pact-era small arms and light weapons, armoured vehicles and artillery dating back to the 1970s and 80s. 
Scenarios like these give military strategists and foreign policy buffs sleepless nights. But for many civilians in war-ravaged Iraq and Syria, they’re part of a real-life nightmare. These arms, now captured by or illicitly traded to IS and other armed groups, have facilitated summary killings, enforced disappearances, rape and torture, and other serious human rights abuses amidst a conflict that has forced millions to become internally displaced or to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. 
It’s a damning indictment of the poorly regulated global arms trade that weapons and munitions licensed by governments for export can so easily fall into the hands of human rights abusers. 
What is even worse is that this is a case of history repeating itself. But world leaders have yet to learn their lesson. 
For many, the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq drove home the dangers of an international arms trade lacking in adequate checks and balances. 
When the dust settled after the conflict that ensued when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s powerful armed forces invaded neighbouring Kuwait, it was revealed that his country was awash with arms supplied by all five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council. Perversely, several of them had also armed Iran in the previous decade, fuelling an eight-year war with Iraq that resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. 
Now, the same states are once more pouring weapons into the region, often with wholly inadequate protections against diversion and illicit traffic. 
This week, those states are among more than 100 countries represented in Cancún, Mexico, for the first Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty, which entered into force last December. This meeting is crucial, as it is due to lay down firm rules and procedures for the treaty’s implementation. The participation of civil society in this and future ATT conferences is important to prevent potentially life-threatening decisions to take place out of the public sight. 
Transparency of the ATT reporting process, among other measures, will need to be front and centre, as it will certainly mean the difference between having meaningful checks and balances that can end up saving lives or a weakened treaty that gathers dust as states carry on business as usual in the massive conventional arms trade. 
A trade shrouded in secrecy and worth tens of billions of dollars, it claims upwards of half a million lives and countless injuries every year, while putting millions more at risk of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations. 
The ATT includes a number of robust rules to stop the flow of arms to countries when it is known they would be used for further atrocities. 
The treaty has swiftly won widespread support from the international community, including five of the top 10 arms exporters – France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.  
The USA, by far the largest arms producer and exporter, is among 58 additional countries that have signed but not yet ratified the treaty. However, other major arms producers like China, Canada and Russia have so far resisted signing or ratifying. 
One of the ATT’s objectives is “to prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion”, so governments have a responsibility to take measures to prevent situations where their arms deals lead to human rights abuses. 
Having rigorous controls in place will help ensure that states can no longer simply open the floodgates of arms into a country in conflict or whose government routinely uses arms to repress peoples’ human rights. 
The more states get on board the treaty, and the more robust and transparent the checks and balances are, the more it will bring about change in the murky waters of the international arms trade. It will force governments to be more discerning about who they do business with. 
The international community has so far failed the people of Syria and Iraq, but the ATT provides governments with a historic opportunity to take a critical step towards protecting civilians from such horrors in the future. They should grab this opportunity with both hands.

One year after the launch of Panic Button, our phone app for human rights activists, we find out how it’s helping them to prepare for attacks, coordinate with their networks, and stay safe. 
“We are afraid. We are afraid that the abduction that happened to our parents might also happen to us.” 
Ipe Soco’s mother and grandfather were abducted from a car they were travelling in and have remained missing ever since. He now works for Desaparecidos, an organization fighting for the victims of enforced disappearances in the Philippines. He’s talking to me as part of a workshop for Panic Button, our app for Android phones which aims to help human rights activists who are at risk of an attack. 
Launched with our partners iilab, the engine room and Frontline Defenders, the app is a mobile ‘distress signal’ which, when activated, sends three recipients an alert message and location update every five minutes. But it’s much more than an app. It also encourages activists like Ipe to prepare and make security plans with a network of trusted people, so that they can respond quickly if something happens. 
“Every day I make sure my sister knows where I’m going and what kind of work I’ll be doing that particular day,” Ipe tells me. “I tell her the time that I am supposed to be in a particular area and what time she can expect me home.” 
Developing a plan of action 
Ipe is one of more than 120 activists from 17 countries who helped us test the app and integrate it into their plans. These activists often live with the constant threat of being detained or attacked. But by talking about the risks with their contacts and developing a plan of action, they can take back some control over their security. In the Panic Button trial, we call this process ‘setting up a PACT’ (short for ‘Prepare-Act’). 
Activists told us that having a PACT made them more aware of security issues, so that they frequently checked up on each other’s situation. They also said it had increased their confidence and made them feel safer, bringing a degree of peace of mind when working in high-risk environments. 
As a human rights activist from El Salvador told me during a workshop we ran in San Salvador: “It’s a guarantee that if at any time something happens to me there will be companions who will know what they can do.” 
In this way, technology is only as useful as the practices of those who use it. The most important thing will always be communication, human judgment and strong communities. Or, as another activist from the Philippines puts it: “Security is community. Having a PACT gives you a sense of security.” 
Giving activists the tools they need 
Inevitably, using technology brings challenges. In our evaluation of Panic Button, activists also report technical problems, weak network coverage in remote areas and patchy GPS signal. But we are working to keep improving the app and the supporting materials so that they are as reliable and relevant as possible. 
Our hope is that human rights activists like Ipe will have the tools they need to respond when someone is in danger. And they’ll gain critical information about time and location so attackers can later be brought to justice. 
“Doing this kind of work is really risky,” Ipe tells me. “But Panic Button can really help minimize the danger. Or at least inform the family or community of the victim of their whereabouts.” 
“I just wish my family had that tool on the day they disappeared, so that at least we knew where to start to look for them.”

Here he explains how governments are using malicious computer code to spy on journalists and human rights activists across the world. 
 
What is spyware and how is it different to malware? 
Broadly, malware is malicious code that does something harmful or undesirable on a user’s system that runs without their consent. Most people will be familiar with the concept of viruses, trojans, crimeware and even ransomware, which encrypts your data and tries to ‘ransom’ it back to you. Over the last few years there has been a rise in awareness of malware used for surveillance, or spyware. This is software installed on a victim’s computer by state actors, spies and police, rather than cyber criminals. It gives them access to the victim’s online communications and, as so much of our lives is now online, this is where most state surveillance now occurs. 
How much can they see? 
It depends on what you do on the device that has been compromised. For example, as mobile phones have become less about making phone calls and more about general online communication, we’ve seen a corresponding market for so-called ‘lawful intercept’ mobile spyware. If you have this type of software surreptitiously installed on your phone it allows people to track your location via GPS, access your contacts list, spy on your SMS messaging, record your phone calls, see what you’re talking about on Facebook chat and more. 
Who is being targeted? 
A group of Moroccan journalists and activists known as Mamfakinch were targeted with malware that appears to have been deployed by the Moroccan authorities. They were sent a “bait” document” in the form of a communication pretending to be a news “scoop”. When analysed, I found the document contained malicious code that secretly installed spyware on their devices, so the government could see what Mamfakinch were going to be writing and who their sources were. 
I also discovered that Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights defender in the United Arab Emirates, has been tracked using commercial spyware. He’s constantly subjected to physical and electronic surveillance, and has been beaten and physically assaulted. He has also received numerous death threats because of his peaceful activism. 
During the Arab Spring, the government of Bahrain used spyware sold to them by a UK firm to monitor a group called Bahrain Watch, which tracks arms sales. And in the US, a satellite television station ESAT which reports on Ethiopia was targeted by spyware created by another European company. 
Who are the companies selling spyware? 
There are smaller players that have become notorious for their sales to repressive regimes. A British-German company Gamma International distributed the spyware used to monitor the activists in Bahrain. Then there’s Hacking Team, an Italian company involved in the attack on Mamfakinch and who have previously sold spyware to a variety of repressive governments, including Sudan, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. A recent leak showed that they were contemplating selling to Libya as recently as May this year. And then there are the bigger multinational companies, such as Lockheed-Martin, BAE Systems and Raytheon, who also make this type of technology. This map shows many more of the players operating in the shady surveillance industry. 
What can activists and journalists do about it? 
The use of protective technologies like encryption, anonymization and privacy tools is pretty low among human rights activists. A lot of people have a good idea of the sensitive information – documents, communications, research – they might want to protect. So the next step is to educate yourself and start thinking sanely about security. There are a number of resources online, such as EFF’s comprehensive surveillance self-defence kit. For a quick and simple guide, you can also read this blog post by a colleague from Citizen Lab. 
I tend to shy away from broadly advocating individual tools as if they’re a panacea, because nothing is a universal surveillance cure-all. People also need to realise they’re not only making that decision for themselves, but for other people they’re communicating with who may be in a more dangerous situation. 
What should Amnesty be doing about it? 
I think it’s really positive that organisations like Amnesty are starting to speak out about the dangers of surveillance for human rights groups. Amnesty, who have themselves been spied on, know directly what a harmful trend this is. I’m hoping that this will promote a more positive ‘security hygiene’ in this space. And it’s also great that Amnesty is lobbying for more positive policy change in this area too. I’d love to see more transparency around the use of this type of surveillance by governments, as well as a raised awareness among individuals and small organisations about the security measures they should be taking. 
What will happen in the future? 
It’s difficult to look too far in to the future since this is a rapidly changing area of technology. We’ve seen the NSA say they’re going to stop collecting metadata from mobile phones, but on the other side the UK government and the FBI have been fear-mongering about strong encryption on chat and messaging applications and arguing for greater access to users’ private data. It’s really difficult to predict how this will all pan out, but it’s never been more important for people to get involved in the debate and scrutinise what governments are doing.

Q. Why did you decide to leak documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?  
These documents were important because they relate to two connected counter-insurgency conflicts in real-time from the ground. Humanity has never had this complete and detailed a record of what modern warfare actually looks like. Once you realize that the co-ordinates represent a real place where people live; that the dates happened in our recent history; that the numbers are actually human lives – with all the love, hope, dreams, hatred, fear, and nightmares that come with them – then it’s difficult to ever forget how important these documents are. 
				@xychelsea I stand with YOU and call on the US govt to protect whistleblowers #FreeManning				  
 Write a letter to President Obama or directly to Chelsea 
 Read her thank you note 
 Q. What did you think the consequences might be for you personally? 
In 2010, I was a lot younger. The consequences felt very vague. I expected the worst possible outcome, but I didn’t have a strong sense of what that might entail. But I expected to be demonized and have every moment of my life examined and analyzed for every single possible screw-up that I’ve ever made – every flaw and blemish – and to have them used against me in the court of public opinion. I was especially afraid that my gender identity would be used against me.	  
  
Q. What was it like to feel the full force of the US justice system and be presented as a traitor? 
It was particularly interesting to see the logistics involved in the prosecution: the stacks of money spent; the gallons of fuel burned; the reams of paper printed; the lengthy rolls of security personnel, lawyers, and experts – it felt silly at times. It felt especially silly being presented as a traitor by the officers who prosecuted my case. I saw them out of court for at least 100 days before and during the trial and developed a very good sense of who they were as people. I’m fairly certain that they got a good sense of who I am as a person too. I remain convinced that even the advocates that presented the treason arguments did not believe their own words as they spoke them. 
	  
Q. Many people think of you as a whistleblower. Why are whistleblowers important? 
In an ideal world, governments, corporations, and other large institutions would be transparent by default. Unfortunately, the world is not ideal. Many institutions begin a slow creep toward being opaque and we need people who recognize that. I think the term “whistleblowers” has an overwhelmingly negative connotation in government and business, akin to a “tattle-tale” or “snitch”. This needs to be addressed somehow. Very often policies that supposedly protect such people are actually used to discredit them. 
	  
Q. What would you say to somebody who is afraid to speak out against injustice? 
First, I would point out that life is precious. In Iraq in 2009-10, life felt very cheap. It became overwhelming to see the sheer number of people suffering and dying, and the learned indifference to it by everybody around me, including the Iraqis themselves. That really changed my perspective on my life, and made me realize that speaking out about injustices is worth the risk. Second, in your life, you are rarely given the chance to really make a difference. Every now and then you do come across a significant choice. Do you really want to find yourself asking whether you could have done more, 10-20 years later? These are the kinds of questions I didn’t want to haunt me. 
 Q. Why did you choose this particular artwork (above) to represent you? 
It’s the closest representation of what I might look like if I was allowed to present and express myself the way I see fit. Even after I came out as a trans woman in 2013, I have not been able to express myself as a woman in public. So I worked with Alicia Neal, an artist in California, to sketch a realistic portrait that more accurately represents who I am. Unfortunately, with the current rules at military confinement facilities, it is very unlikely that I will have any photos taken until I am released – which, parole and clemency notwithstanding, might not be for another two decades.

First, I would point out that life is precious. In Iraq in 2009-10, life felt very cheap. It became overwhelming to see the sheer number of people suffering and dying, and the learned indifference to it by everybody around me, including the Iraqis themselves. That really changed my perspective on my life, and made me realize that speaking out about injustices is worth the risk. Second, in your life, you are rarely given the chance to really make a difference. Every now and then you do come across a significant choice. Do you really want to find yourself asking whether you could have done more, 10-20 years later? These are the kinds of questions I didn’t want to haunt me. 
,  
 Q. Why did you choose this particular artwork (above) to represent you? 
,  
It’s the closest representation of what I might look like if I was allowed to present and express myself the way I see fit. Even after I came out as a trans woman in 2013, I have not been able to express myself as a woman in public. So I worked with Alicia Neal, an artist in California, to sketch a realistic portrait that more accurately represents who I am. Unfortunately, with the current rules at military confinement facilities, it is very unlikely that I will have any photos taken until I am released – which, parole and clemency notwithstanding, might not be for another two decades.

In many countries around the world, Indigenous women, men and youth are much more likely than other members of society to spend a significant part of their lives behind bars. 
The disproportionate rates of incarceration are usually a result both of the ongoing, largely unaddressed impact of colonial policies and practices that have marginalized and impoverished Indigenous peoples and of the systemic discrimination and bias that continue to face Indigenous peoples in justice systems that remain foreign to their cultures and values. 
These factors play out at every point of contact between Indigenous people and the justice system. And the problem is especially acute for Indigenous youth. 
The experience in Canada 
Numerous studies in Canada demonstrate that Indigenous women and men are more likely to come into negative contact with the law whether by committing a crime or being suspected of a crime, are more likely to face charges when there is discretion about whether or not a charge should be laid, are likely to face more serious charges than other people accused of the same crime, if convicted are likely to be given a longer sentence, and once imprisoned are likely to face stricter security conditions and have less access to rehabilitative programs and to parole. 
These factors also mean that Indigenous offenders are also more likely to be affected by laws that, based on a history of prior convictions, require either mandatory minimum sentences or which allow for indeterminate, potentially lifelong sentences such as the dangerous offender designation. 
As a consequence, almost a third of all people being placed in some form of custody in Canada are Indigenous, even though Indigenous people make up only 4 percent of the population. And the problem of over-incarceration is especially acute for Indigenous women and youth. 
According to a Statistics Canada report, First Nations, Inuit and Métis women account for 43 percent of all women being placed behind bards in Canada,. At the same time,  Indigenous girls make up 49% of the young women being placed in custody and Indigenous boys make up 36% of boys admitted to custody. 
The over-incarceration of Indigenous youth and adults in Canada has been examined in countless judicial inquiries and other studies from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and to the recent summary report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The TRC summary report released in June, noted, “It is assumed that locking up offenders makes communities safer, but there is no evidence to demonstrate that this is indeed the case.” 
The TRC’s Call to Action includes a call for federal, provincial and territorial governments to eliminate the over-incarceration of Indigenous women, men and youth in the next decade, including through greater attention to alternatives to incarceration. 
A crisis in Australia 
A recent Amnesty International report on the over-incarceration of Indigenous youth in Australia reveals a situation with many direct parallels to Canada. Crucially, the report, called A brighter tomorrow: Keeping Indigenous kids in the community and out of detention, highlights some of the work being done at the community level to develop alternatives to incarceration. 
The report looks in particular at the concept of “justice reinvestment”, of focusing more government resources not on keeping increasing numbers of people in prison, but on addressing economic and social needs that contribute to high crime rates, supporting community led safety plans and developing effective alternatives to incarceration that meet the needs of justice and community safety but also increase the likelihood of genuine rehabilitation. 
Unfortunately, as the report documents, not only are such initiatives being denied adequate long-term funding, the overall direction of government policy in Australia threatens to make things even worse. 
In Western Australia the incarceration rate for Indigenous youth has climbed to the point that Indigenous youth make up 80 percent of young people being incarcerated even though they make up only 6 percent of the youth population. 
A critical factor are state laws that require judges to impose mandatory minimum sentences for young offenders in a number of situations. For example, in certain circumstances laws in Western Australia currently require judges to impose a mandatory one year sentence for a third burglary conviction, even where these offenses result from minor or extenuating circumstances, such as stealing food to eat. 
The report notes that “Because of these laws, the Children’s Court is prevented from ensuring that detention is a measure of last resort, that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration, and that each child is dealt with in a manner proportionate to their circumstances and the offence.” 
	Now, the legislature in Western Australia is considering adopting a new Bill that would make things even worse. The government has already acknowledged that by expanding the cases where a mandatory will apply, the Criminal Law Amendment (Home Burglary and Other Offences) Bill 2014 will put more young people behind bars for longer periods. 
Amnesty International is calling for the Bill to be rejected and for mandatory minimum sentences for youth to be repealed, in keeping with international human rights standards. You can add your voice here.

The work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has helped shine a light on the horrendous and lasting harm done by tearing Indigenous children from their families, their communities, their languages and their cultures. 
Critically, as the TRC report itself highlights, the uprooting of Indigenous children was not limited to the Residential School Programme. 
For decades, Indigenous families having difficulties providing adequate care for their children – whether as a result of impoverishment, the intergenerational consequences of abuses suffered in residential schools, or other social and economic stresses –  have been denied the help they need. 
Today, as a case before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has highlighted, persistent federal underfunding of on reserve child and family services has made the removal of children all too common,  because the responsible agencies can’t afford to intervene in other ways. 
This follows an earlier phenomenon known as the “60’s scoop” in which Indigenous children, removed from their families and communities by social service agencies, were offered up for adoption on the belief they would be inherently better off raised by non-Indigenous families. 
Colleen Cardinal is a Plains Cree woman from Saddle Lake Cree Nation, Alberta who currently resides in Algonquin Territory. Colleen is an Indigenous adoptee of the 60’s scoop, the daughter of a residential school survivor and has had two women murdered in her family. 
Amnesty International first worked with Colleen through her involvement with Families of Sisters in Spirit (FSIS) based in Ottawa. Colleen speaks publicly and candidly about murdered and missing Indigenous women and the impacts of the 60’s scoop, drawing critical connections between genocidal colonial policies and her lived experiences and those of women in her family. 
Colleen believes that sharing her story is an important part of her healing journey in addition to raising awareness and building solidarity and understanding within Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. Colleen is also a volunteer organizer for the Indigenous Adoptee Gathering 2014 and the upcoming IAG 2015. She is currently working on a video documentary called “A Hidden Generation.” 
What’s your best sense of the number of Aboriginal people like you who have grown up away from their biological families, away from their cultures, and away from their traditional territories because of the 60’s scoop? 
Right now, we don’t have accurate numbers. Myself, I know at least 200 people that I’ve met through Facebook and in person. They estimate that there are up to 20,000 but we don’t know yet because there hasn’t been enough research. We know that there were a lot of adoptees that have been taken overseas and to the States, so it’s really hard to tell. 
As you said, it’s such a common experience that you end up meeting so many people where this has been part of their lives. You hear of people who grew up in wonderful, supportive families and you hear about people who had a very different experience with their adopted families. What do you think is the common ground? 
The common experience, whether they had a good home or a bad home, is loss of culture and a crisis of identity. Not knowing who they were or where they belonged and feeling like they didn’t fit in anywhere. 
And even once they find out where they came from, finding their culture is another challenge. 
I didn’t find out until I was 28 that I was Plains Cree. Even then I didn’t know what that really meant. I thought all Indians were the same, because nobody had ever given me any context.  
It’s hard to find that knowledge in an urban environment. There’s no easy fix of just saying, go back to your reserve. We don’t know anybody there. It would be a huge culture shock. And things like knowing what elders to talk to, how to navigate the society, we don’t necessarily have that knowledge. 
I know now that in our teachings everything about being Indigenous is about being connected to the land. Our language comes from the land. Once you start regaining that, you realize how immense the loss was. And how it impacts our children and our children’s children if we don’t reconnect to the land and our culture. 
My culture is my identity. That’s what’s been denied to me. 
You’ve talked before about the 60’s scope as part of a continuation of what began with the residential schools. Can you talk a little bit now about that connection. 
I think what they have in common is the loss of culture – the removal of culture – and it being a deliberate effort to assimilate Indigenous people into the mainstream society. 
The difference with residential schools is that children were all brought to specific physical locations whereas with the adoptees, it was all spread out and behind closed doors. It kind of went undetected. 
There was a lot of trauma from that. There was physical and sexual abuse. And even where that didn’t happen, there was still displacement from territory and disconnection from that familiarity of knowing who you are and where you come from. 
And if you’re not connected with the land, it has no meaning to you. Which is why, I think, the land is in so much trouble right now. We’re not connected to land any more. It’s not a living thing to us. It’s just something that can be used to extract resources. And that to me is the larger issue, that deliberate attempt to disconnect us from the land so that we don’t care about it and we’re not invested in it. 
You’ve talked about the incredible difficulty of reconnecting to culture and territory. What have been some of the things that have helped you in your own experience? 
I didn’t find anything until I went back to college when I was 29. I had never seen culture, I had never done smudging and I didn’t know anything about sweat lodges. I didn’t even know that that was part of our identity. When I was first introduced to that it was through the Native Community Worker programme at Sault College that incorporated culture into the curriculum. That was my first eye-opener. 
The difficulty in navigating that is figuring out where you fit in. For a long time I felt like I had to be a pow wow dancer or I had to drum. I had to be like this super-Indian to fit in. And then as you get older you realize, you know what, it’s not like that. Just seeking our truth and having a spiritual connection with the Creator and with the land is the most important thing. 
The difficult part for myself is the internal message that I grew up with. I grew up in a non-Indigenous home. I grew up internalizing racism towards Indigenous people. I also grew up with the values of non-Indigenous people where, you know, consumerism and all the things you have do to fit in with the mainstream. 
Undoing all that is part of the process of reclaiming my culture. That was hard for me. It’s a big process of unlearning and relearning and it takes time. And not only do I have to do it, I have to help my children do it because they’re impacted by my adoption. 
Now that you’re working with other adoptees as part of a larger movement, what are the kinds of supports that you’re able to extend to each other? 
Oh my gosh. We have so many things in common.  We’re all learning how to do culture again. It’s very scary to go into ceremony and not know what to expect. My first experience with ceremony in Sault Ste-Marie, I was terrified. I didn’t want to make any mistakes. Doing that together with other people who are also learning, it’s really good. It’s a safe, gentle environment. And we’re aware of each other’s fear of it. And we’re aware of our hesitation to jump into it because we might have some resistance from our adoptive families. 
Like, there’s this weird thing that we have with our adoptive families. I don’t know if I can explain it. There’s this loyalty that we have toward our non-Indigenous families. Even if we’ve experienced abuse, we feel like we’re lucky to have been raised in a good home and to have had all these amazing opportunities. This is what’s instilled in us. And if we speak out against what’s happened, or we try to relearn our culture, we fear they won’t like it. And they often don’t. They say, Why would you want to do that? Why you want to go back to that? 
These are things we can vent about with each other. And try to support and listen to each other. We aren’t necessarily able to do anything about it, but just having each other to talk about it is important because it’s very difficult to understand for someone who hasn’t been through it. 
Working together with other adoptees, you’re identifying changes that are needed for the future. What are some of the key things that you would like to see happen to support adoptees? 
We have a gathering. This is our second one.  That’s a huge support for a lot of adoptees. They’re coming from all over the country to just be here together with other adoptees because that’s so important to just be with each other. But we raised that money ourselves. We have no funding because there is no funding. 
We need funding for our healing, so that we can be well, so that we can have wellness in our families. A lot of us are dealing with mental health issues. We’re dealing with trauma. Addictions are huge. And there’s no support for that.
We have to explain to healthcare providers, even Indigenous health care providers, what the Sixties Scoop was and how it impacted us and how it has affected our lives. And there are no safe cultural spaces for us. We have to explain that we don’t fit in anywhere. 
We need health care providers who understand how it’s impacted us and how that can be addressed through a health and wellness plan. I only ever met one doctor who really understood it with my having to explain about the Sixties Scoop and about historical trauma and having that doctor was a really thing for me. 
I also think education among the mainstream Canadian population is also very badly needed. Because I think it will help undo some harm. We’re dealing with a lot of racism and stigma. A lot of Canadian think the residential school experience was a one time thing and it’s over now and we should just get over it.  They don’t understand that the Sixties Scoop is a continuation of what happened with the residential schools and that the number of our children in care now is a result of the residential schools and the 60’s  Scoop. Until we actually deal with what it was and why it happened, we can’t ever really address it. 
I’m in a place now where I’m tired of talking about all the bad stuff. Some people are just starting to deal with the bad stuff. They’re in a different place in their healing. Me, I want to look at the larger picture. Instead of just talking about the abuses, I want to talk about the systemic issues and we all can do to make a difference, how can we help Canadians to understand how they’ve implicated in this. And what can they do to help undo the harm. That’s my goal.

Today marks the first anniversary of what has been called the largest mining disaster in British Columbia’s history. In the middle of the night, on August 4, 2014, residents say they were awakened by what sounded like hundreds of jumbo jets flying overhead, a sound that continued for hours as millions of litres of tailings water rushed from Mt Polley’s mine tailings impoundment into Polley Lake, down Hazeltine Creek, and into Quesnel Lake. 
Shaken and knowing something had gone terribly wrong at the mine, those who were awake rushed to call emergency services, while others jumped in quads, boats and trucks to warn people who were camping or living along the lake. In the early hours of panic and fear, residents told Amnesty researchers they didn’t know whether the community’s children were at risk, if they should seek higher ground, or if they should stay put. 
As communications were established and information began trickling through, the scale of the disaster became evident. That day, residents – and the world – found out that the tailings impoundment at Imperial Metals’ Mount Polley copper mine in Central BC had burst sending 25 million cubic metres of water and tailings into pristine Quesnel Lake. Once the shock wore off, residents from the local community of Likely, BC say they became very angry. 
While water quality tests indicate that the water is clean enough to drink, residents we met during our research trip in July 2015 still do not trust it and will not drink it. We also heard serious concerns expressed by scientists, First Nations, local businesses and others, about the future health of salmon and other fish species. Because of the four-year salmon spawning cycle, it may take 4 to 8 years to determine whether the salmon have been damaged. 
Even though the environment is still not fully cleaned up from the Mt Polley spill and the company still lacks a long term discharge plan for excess water, last month the mine received permission from the province to reopen and has just applied to discharge yet more water from the mine, in the short term, to Quesnel Lake. Is it any wonder that some residents continue to feel worried and angered one year on – wondering whether the BC government will stand up to the company to ensure public safety over economic interests?

21 July 2015 marked my 29th anniversary working at Amnesty International and also marked the opening of the trial of former Chadian President Hissene Habré. When I joined Amnesty International in 1986, I was immediately struck by the amount of work already undertaken by colleagues on Chad since 1982, when President Hissène Habré came to power. I joined the team, part of my job was meeting people and collecting testimonies, which Amnesty International then turned into reports, press releases and actions, to shine a light on these grave human rights violations, including torture, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances. Many of these were produced in the period from 1982 to 1990, when Hissène Habré’s rule ended. 
Over the past decades, my colleagues and I met and spoke with so many of the victims of the Habré administration. The dream of many of them did not, unfortunately, come true as they did not live to see him finally face a court this week. On Monday and Tuesday I was at the court room in the Extraordinary African Chambers in Dakar, Senegal, and witnessed how many people attended the opening of this trial on charges of crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes committed while he was in power. Victims were among those there, hoping to see the court put an end to 25 years of impunity for human rights violations and crimes under international law committed under Habré’s watch. 
After his fall from power, so many survivors expressed fears that they would die whilst awaiting this trial. In particular I can remember Samuel Togoto, one person whom I interviewed shortly before his death and who alleged that he had been beaten and tortured in prison – an untimely death because he never  received justice. He is not the only one; other victims have sadly passed away. I can also remember the image of Mahamat Sidi Baby, a former army officer who told Amnesty International that he had been tortured in detention; during his interrogation he was given electric shocks and he was subjected to the “supplice des baguettes”, which made his nose bleed profusely. He often had tea in my office; he was very disheartened and was receiving medical attention following his detention. 
According to the National Commission of Inquiry in Chad, 40,000 people are estimated to have died at the hands of Habré’s security forces, and many more were tortured.

After the fall of Habré’s administration, more than 50,000 letters and postcards from Amnesty International members were found at the main security headquarters in the Chadian capital N’Djamena, known as Direction de la Documentation et de la Sécurité (DDS).

It also states that the number of postcards and letters sent may even be higher as a number of them were destroyed by the authorities.

On Tuesday, I also saw the disappointment on their faces when the trial was adjourned until September after Habré and his lawyers refused to speak to the judge. The court has now appointed three new lawyers to represent him. The courtroom was full to the brim and my thoughts went immediately to the victims who had travelled from near and far to be present for this trial and who have waited over 25 long years to see justice delivered.

,  
21 July 2015 marked my 29th anniversary working at Amnesty International and also marked the opening of the trial of former Chadian President Hissene Habré. When I joined Amnesty International in 1986, I was immediately struck by the amount of work already undertaken by colleagues on Chad since 1982, when President Hissène Habré came to power. I joined the team, part of my job was meeting people and collecting testimonies, which Amnesty International then turned into reports, press releases and actions, to shine a light on these grave human rights violations, including torture, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances. Many of these were produced in the period from 1982 to 1990, when Hissène Habré’s rule ended. 
,  
Over the past decades, my colleagues and I met and spoke with so many of the victims of the Habré administration. The dream of many of them did not, unfortunately, come true as they did not live to see him finally face a court this week. On Monday and Tuesday I was at the court room in the Extraordinary African Chambers in Dakar, Senegal, and witnessed how many people attended the opening of this trial on charges of crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes committed while he was in power. Victims were among those there, hoping to see the court put an end to 25 years of impunity for human rights violations and crimes under international law committed under Habré’s watch. 
,  
After his fall from power, so many survivors expressed fears that they would die whilst awaiting this trial. In particular I can remember Samuel Togoto, one person whom I interviewed shortly before his death and who alleged that he had been beaten and tortured in prison – an untimely death because he never  received justice. He is not the only one; other victims have sadly passed away. I can also remember the image of Mahamat Sidi Baby, a former army officer who told Amnesty International that he had been tortured in detention; during his interrogation he was given electric shocks and he was subjected to the “supplice des baguettes”, which made his nose bleed profusely. He often had tea in my office; he was very disheartened and was receiving medical attention following his detention. 
,  
According to the National Commission of Inquiry in Chad, 40,000 people are estimated to have died at the hands of Habré’s security forces, and many more were tortured. I can recall many testimonies of this torture. One such method includes a technique called “Arbatachar” where the victim’s arms are tied behind his or her back at elbow level, pushing the torso forward, and then the feet and the arms are also tied together.

If you’re a woman, you may be denied contraception, simply because you don’t have your husband’s permission. And if you do manage to get contraception, you may be forced to use it in secret for fear of being accused of adultery by your partner or in-laws. 
,  
If you’re a rape survivor, pregnant as a result of that assault, you must pay for your own emergency medical care – something that is out of reach for most victims. 
,  
It’s an unsustainable situation. Burkina Faso’s girls want their childhoods back. Their mothers, aunts and sisters are fed up of being side-lined from the decisions that affect their lives. Stand with them today. 
,  
,  
,  
,  
In Burkina Faso, whether you’re a woman or a girl, you are prevented from making crucial decisions that belong to you. Decisions like whether or when to get married, whom to marry, and whether or when to get pregnant. These barriers to choice are fuelled by social attitudes that value men and boys over women and girls. 
,  
	This discrimination results in abuses of the basic human rights of women and girls, including their right to life, to education and to quality health care, particularly sexual and reproductive health care. 
,  
, 		Rose, aged 46 
,  
Above all, this discrimination denies women and girls their sexual and reproductive rights – rights which allow them to freely make decisions about what happens to their bodies and their lives without threat of violence. This includes the right to proper information and services on sexual health, family planning and sexuality. 
,  
The consequences of these abuses are clear when you look at the numbers. Only 64.2% of girls can access education but many of them are forced to give up school to get married or to take on domestic work. By the time they are 19 years old, most girls have already become wives, and nearly half of all young women are already mothers.

Today, AI Canada’s Business and Human Rights research team arrived in the jaw-droppingly beautiful village of Likely, in the centre of the province of British Columbia. On August 4, 2014, Likely was the scene of one of the largest tailings pond breaches in Canadian history when the Mount Polley copper mine tailings dam burst, sending 25 million cubic metres of water and mine waste rushing into local creeks and lakes. Tiny creek beds were scoured, trees snapping like match sticks, as the waters rushed down from the dam into Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek and Quesnel Lake, depositing tailings across the landscape as it went. 
We’re here for the next few days to listen to people’s stories about what happened that day, how the company and the government of British Columbia responded to the disaster, and how, in the 11 months since, residents are getting on with their lives. 
As we left behind the traffic of Vancouver, the impossible heat of Lytton, and climbed in 3000 feet in elevation to Williams Lake, we wondered what kind of reaction our research team would receive from people in the area. The Mount Polley spill was a major event here, making international news. Over the intervening 11 months, dozens of researchers, reporters, government workers, and scientists have convened on the Cariboo region to interview, photograph, test, analyze, question and reassure. There is a certain amount of interview fatigue here. But there is also curiosity about why Amnesty International is interested in this story and sent a research team to investigate. 
After our first full day of meetings with various groups, a rich and complicated picture is starting to emerge of disbelief and trauma over the breach; fear for the future of the salmon, water and peoples’ health; resilience and ingenuity among affected communities; and hope that the environment will heal, lessons will have been learned, and that regulation and oversight of mining operations will be strengthened in this province. 
In the days ahead, we will speak to many more people whose stories will help us determine how the three pillars of corporate accountability – State duty to protect rights, company responsibility to respect rights, and the right to remedy for harms – have stood up under the weight of the Mount Polley tailings pond breach and what more needs to be done. 
This last point seems particularly pressing. After a 30 day public comment period, this month Mount Polley was given permission by the Province to re-start operations at the mine. Tonight we are hosting a town hall meeting in Likely to share more information with communities about why we are investigating the breach and to invite them to share with us their thoughts and feelings about their experiences, news of the mine re-opening and hopes for the future.

The UN Human Rights Committee, which regularly reviews whether states are living up to their obligations under the binding International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,  today made more than a dozen recommendations for fundamental changes in Canadian law and policy in respect to the treatment of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. 
The Committee was so concerned about issues of violence against Indigenous women and the violation of Indigenous Peoples’ land rights that it called on Canada to report back within one year on progress made to implement its recommendations on these issues. 
“Today’s report shows that we need action now on our collective agenda for closing the human rights gap,” said Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.  “It is significant that a report on human rights in Canada focuses so much on Indigenous peoples and Indigenous rights. This speaks to the extent of our challenges and the urgent need to address them.  The report is yet another call to action for Canada to work with First Nations as partners to realize our human rights, including our Aboriginal and Treaty rights.” 
The Committee joined numerous other international human rights bodies, including the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in urging Canada to hold an independent public inquiry to address the root causes of the disproportionate levels of violence facing Indigenous women and girls and ensure that all attacks and disappearances are fully and properly investigated. 
Craig Benjamin of Amnesty International Canada said, “This is one more important voice added to the call for the kind of independent public inquiry that we need to establish a truly comprehensive and effective national plan of action.  The federal government has to stop making excuses and sit down with Indigenous women and affected families to ensure that the long overdue inquiry can finally happen.” 
The Committee also expressed concern about the “potential extinguishment” of Indigenous peoples’ land rights and that, “despite favourable rulings of the Supreme Court”, governments continue to impose unwanted decisions affecting Indigenous peoples’ use of their lands and territories. 
The Committee urged Canada to do more to ensure the timely and fair resolution of land disputes and to respect the international standard of free, prior and informed consent in decisions affecting Indigenous rights. 
“Indigenous peoples are being forced into long and costly court battles to defend their traditions and ways of life because governments in Canada still refuse to accept the need to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples on important decisions about environmental protection and resource development,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs. “It’s ironic that the Committee report should come out in the midst of today’s court hearings into the Site C dam, a megaproject approved by the federal and province governments over the objections of First Nations and despite a highly critical environmental assessment.” 
The Committee also called on Canada to fully implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
Jennifer Henry, Executive Director of KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives, said, “We welcome the Committee’s recognition of the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It’s important to note that one of the key recommendations of the Commission is for Canada to use the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as the framework for reconciliation.” 
Other crucial recommendations on Indigenous Peoples’ rights in today’s Committee report include: 
The report also included recommendations on the rights of migrants and refugees, accountability for Canadian corporations operating in other countries, and the infringement of human rights in the name of security and counter-terrorism. 
“In line with the reconciliation process that is now part of the national dialogue in Canada, we will thoroughly examine the Committee’s Report and insist that governments remain accountable to the UN and the Canadian public,” said Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day. “We urge all Canadians to read the Committee’s report and to join us in demanding that federal and provincial leaders make a clear commitment to implementing these urgently needed measures that respect and protect human rights in Canada.”

The UK should hold an independent judge-led inquiry into surveillance of human rights organizations by UK security services, Amnesty International said today in a letter sent to Prime Minister David Cameron. 
The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which oversees surveillance matters in the UK, informed Amnesty International last week that the UK has been intercepting, accessing and storing its communications, but is yet to provide an explanation as to why. 
“The Prime Minister needs to explain why the UK government is subjecting law-abiding human rights organizations to surveillance. This revelation makes it vividly clear that mass surveillance has gone too far. We must finally have proper checks and balances,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary-General. 
“It’s absolutely shocking that Amnesty International’s private correspondence was deemed fair game to UK spooks, who have clearly lost all sense of what is proportionate or appropriate.  A key measure of a free society is how it treats its charities and NGOs. If Amnesty International is being spied on, then is anyone safe?” said Kate Allen, Amnesty UK’s Director. 
The human rights group is also calling on David Cameron to publish as much as possible of the findings of a report from the tribunal due to be sent to him relating to the revelation. 
The letter, signed by Amnesty International Secretary-General Salil Shetty and Amnesty UK Director Kate Allen, warns that confirmation that the UK has been spying on the communications of non-governmental organizations “sends a chilling message to human rights organizations and charities in the UK and abroad”. 
The letter follows serious concerns raised by peers from across the political spectrum over the revelation, in a debate on surveillance in the House of Lords yesterday.

Every year, roughly half a million people are killed by firearms, many of which have been transferred irresponsibly. 
The poorly controlled flow of arms also fuels conflicts in which millions more die because of mass displacement and loss of access to basic health care clean water and food. 
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, it is estimated that more than five million people have died since 1998 as an indirect result of armed conflict. 
In order to address this global challenge, Amnesty International – alongside other civil society groups and victims of armed violence – advocated for an international treaty to regulate the global transfer of arms. 
We argued that arms should not be sent to places where they are likely to be used to commit serious human rights violations. 
Those massive campaigning efforts resulted in the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which came into force on 24 December 2014. 
Since then, the international community has been trying to develop rules and procedures that will make the ATT fully functional. 
The first Conference of States Parties (CSP) to the ATT is due to take place in Mexico in August 2015. 
Meetings aimed at paving the way for a successful first conference have been taking place throughout 2015 in Port-of-Spain and Vienna. The final preparatory meeting took place in Geneva this week. 
However, the future success of the ATT is being called into question in these discussions. 
States that have so far supported tight regulation of arms transfers are now backing off, in order to make space for a compromise with those who want the treaty to be “business as usual”. 
This has affected the debate over how transparent and publicly accountable the arms trade is going to be under the ATT. 
Transparency is one of the main objectives of the ATT, in recognition that the trade in arms has, up until now, been shrouded in secrecy. 
The value of the trade is estimated to be close to US$100 billion annually and it is constantly increasing. In 2010 it was around US$72 billion. And if you add on all the related services, including military and construction, the trade is worth at least around US$120 billion right now. 
During the preparatory conference in Geneva, the key discussions affecting transparency focused on the participation of civil society groups in the CSP and on how much information on arms transfers should be reported and made publicly available by states. 
Some states suggested that civil society groups should pay a fee to participate in the work of the CSP. Other states said they would be willing to limit the groups’ participation to plenary sessions, excluding NGOs from attending meetings of subsidiary bodies. 
These proposals are shocking. They undermine the core idea behind the ATT, which is to ensure transparency in the arms trade and to reduce human suffering. 
Civil society is crucial to ensuring transparency in the arms trade. 
Amnesty International and other groups have campaigned for the establishment of the ATT for almost 20 years. 
Together, they have developed a massive amount of expertise which can only strengthen the treaty. They also provide an important link to the victims and survivors of armed violence whose suffering the ATT is supposed to reduce. 
Closing civil society’s access to the work of subsidiary bodies will inevitably mean the most important discussions on the transfer of arms will again be shrouded in secrecy. This will indeed mean “business as usual”, as the whole purpose of the ATT will be seriously undermined. 
Deliberations are also taking place in Geneva on what information on arms transfers should be reported and made publically available by states. 
Unfortunately civil society groups have not been able to make a meaningful contribution to the development of these proposals. 
As a result, the latest reporting templates did not live up to the standard of transparency established by the treaty. Proposals on state reporting have been stripped down to a bare minimum, which means that states may only be obliged to report on the value of transfers annually. 
It is essential to the meaningful implementation of the ATT that states provide a comprehensive picture of their arms transfers. In order for those reports to be effective, they should include information on both authorizations and actual arms deliveries. The size of the transfer should include the number of units as well as the financial value. States should also report separately on each category of small arms and light weapons. 
It is also vital that the information on the end use – and on the end user – of the arms is reported, and made publically available. 
The question of who ends up using the arms, and how, matters a great deal. 
This could mean the failure to prevent the death of half a million people next year because of the irresponsible transfer of arms, while allowing the arms industry to cash in another US$120 billion. 
It has a direct bearing on the likelihood of those arms being used to commit human rights violations. 
As the final preparatory conference of states parties to the ATT concludes in Geneva, states must realise that without transparency, the treaty will have little positive effect. 
Unless states allow civil society groups to meaningfully participate in the work of the ATT, and unless they adopt comprehensive and transparent reporting requirements, the treaty will have not be effectively enforced.

“This is not the Canada I once knew.”  
	Those were the words of a British member of the UN Human Rights Committee who was taking part this week in the committee’s first review of Canada’s human rights record in 10 years. 
Sir Nigel Rodley, a law professor and chair of the Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex, was referring to the deteriorating space for human rights advocacy, protest and dissent in Canada. He noted it was almost unbelievable that the UN committee felt compelled to raise these sorts of concerns with Canada. Sir Nigel highlighted research by the Voices coalition, which pointed to astonishing levels of fear and intimidation felt by Canadian activists and civil society groups, and referred to the disquiet expressed by the UN’s leading expert on the freedoms of assembly and association. He dismissed the Canadian government’s initial response to questions about the crackdown as “thin.” 
It was a powerful moment that came near the end of six hours of back-and-forth, over two days, between committee members (drawn from countries around the world) and a sizable Canadian delegation from various federal departments and the province of Quebec. And it captured wider concerns about the range of troubling issues explored in the review.	  
Some are long-standing, such as concerns about sex discrimination under the federal Indian Act. Others are more recent, such as many references to Bill C-51, the new Anti-Terrorism Act. Some of the issues, certainly violence against indigenous women, have an impact on hundreds of thousands of people. 
The point of the review is not that Canada is among the worst human-rights violators in the world. Of course not. It is a regular review that comes around for all countries that have signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The point, rather, is that all signatories are obliged to protect all rights – and that there is an expectation that a signatory with all the resources and strong institutions that Canada has will set a high example for other countries to follow. 
That is not the picture that emerged during the review, however. Instead, it was of entrenched problems in Canada, such as the failure to have an effective process for recognizing and protecting aboriginal land rights. And of new and troubling developments that take Canada in the wrong direction, such as the battle over federal cuts to health care for refugees. 
All of this against a backdrop of increasing Canadian disregard for many aspects of the international human rights system. Canada was still dismissive of the important UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples – which the government asserted is not binding, not law, only aspirational.	  
Nor did Canada apologize for frequently refusing to comply with requests from UN human rights bodies to hold off on deportations while a full review of troubling cases was under way. And there was no commitment that governments across Canada would come together (for the first time since 1988) to talk about human rights and come up with a transparent, accountable system to ensure full implementation of our international obligations. 
There was no shift in Canada’s apparent determination to not move forward with solutions to complex and urgent problems. No willingness to establish a public inquiry and action plan for murdered and missing aboriginal women, for example. No budging from insistence that voluntary approaches are the best way to ensure that mining companies do not abuse human rights. 
By the end of the review it was difficult to think of a serious social issue, with clear implications for human rights, that had not come up. Homelessness and the right to life. Intelligence sharing and torture. Pay equity and women’s equality rights. Solitary confinement and high incarceration rates of aboriginal people. Detention of immigrants with mental-health problems. 
The committee report is due by month’s end, and then comes the true test for Canada. Will there be a good-faith commitment to take up the UN’s advice to tackle entrenched problems and head off new ones? Will the Canadian government show determination to protect human rights at home and be a leader abroad? Will there be action? 
Or can we look forward to another such performance a decade from now? And another lament of “not the Canada I once knew.” Surely not.

This July marks three years since Yecenia was picked up and tortured by Mexican security forces; tortured so cruelly that she did as she was ordered and signed a “confession” that was used to imprison her. Three long years behind bars far from her children, three years of nightmare treatment, suffering and injustice. 
Amnesty International recently visited Yecenia in jail. Our researchers told her about Amnesty supporters in Canada, and around the world, who are winning successes in our campaign to stop torture. Other survivors of torture in Mexico, like Angel Colón, are now free, while others like Claudia Medina have seen the authorities agree to drop the unjust, fabricated charges against them. 
Our efforts really can make a difference, no matter how impossible it often seems.

Powerful surveillance systems are strangling freedom of expression and interfering with the legitimate work of activists and non-governmental organizations. 
Since former NSA analyst and whistleblower Edward Snowden released one of the biggest intelligence leaks in history two years ago, almost a week doesn’t go past without some new information on electronic surveillance making headlines. And yet, the more that is revealed, the more we become aware just how much governments are keeping us in the dark. 
The first week of July has been particularly notable. Last Wednesday, we were informed by the UK intelligence tribunal that Amnesty International’s private communications were intercepted and accessed by the UK’s intelligence agencies. The notice, which arrived to us in the form of a rather surreal email, was the outcome of a case brought by Amnesty and nine other organizations against the UK government. It concluded more than 18 months of litigation with hearings held either in secret or on the basis that the government could ‘neither confirm nor deny’ any facts. It was a backhanded victory to finally confirm what we suspected: that Amnesty’s communications were spied on by UK intelligence agencies. 
Selling software to repressive governments 
Just days later, a separate revelation would seem to confirm what investigations by security researchers and human rights groups have long asserted, that Hacking Team, a private Italian company that builds and markets powerful surveillance technologies to governments, has been selling its software to countries with a history of repression of peaceful activists and human rights defenders. It is very likely that these governments would have used Hacking Team’s surveillance tools for these purposes. 
The information was leaked after Hacking Team was itself the target of a hack, leading to a data dump online of more than 400GB of internal documents. If proved authentic, the documents are damning for Hacking Team, which has repeatedly denied or avoided allegations that it sold intrusive spying systems to governments including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. According to the hacked files, all three countries appear as Hacking Team customers alongside a list of other countries where there are serious concerns about human rights violations against activists. 
In both cases, far more questions remain than have been answered. For example, we still know nothing about the why, when, how and which of Amnesty’s communications were accessed by UK intelligence agencies. However, what this week’s revelations show beyond doubt is that existing laws and regulations are failing. 
Strangling freedom of expression 
Whether we’re talking about mass surveillance programmes that indiscriminately sweep up everyone’s communications, including the sensitive and confidential communications of NGOs, or whether we’re talking about the rapidly growing market for cheap and highly intrusive surveillance equipment available to any government which can afford the price tag, it is clear that governments across the world are increasingly using powerful surveillance systems in ways that strangle freedom of expression and interfere with the legitimate work of activists and non-governmental organizations. 
This is a trend as worrying in the UK as it is in Saudi Arabia. When human rights organizations like Amnesty International can no longer guarantee that our communications with sources and victims will not be accessed without our knowledge by UK spy agencies, it erodes the trust placed in us and affects our ability to conduct sensitive investigations. 
Equally, when governments such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Ethiopia routinely target activists and infect their computers and phones with malicious spyware, it leads to the silencing of civil society. We’ve witnessed this “chilling effect” directly in the past few years as trusted contacts in some countries can no longer exchange digital communications with Amnesty without fearing repercussions because their communications are compromised. 
World of ubiquitous surveillance 
We are left wondering how those who stand up to government oppression, corruption and negligence – whether they are human rights defenders, investigative journalists or environmental activists – will continue to operate in a world of ubiquitous surveillance. 
That’s why Amnesty International is calling for governments to end indiscriminate mass surveillance and introduce proper oversights to ensure that surveillance only takes place when it is legitimate, targeted and based on reasonable suspicion. 
We also believe the trade in surveillance technology needs much greater oversight and that governments should be responsible for assessing and preventing the export of surveillance technologies where they are likely to be used for human rights violations. 
The alternative is daunting: the silencing of dissent and ever more unaccountable governments.

Follow Steve on Twitter @stevecrawshaw 
Srebrenica. A drive through eastern Bosnia seems to be full of sleepy Balkan charm. The landscape is one of wooded hills, small farmsteads, abundant plum orchards. The road winds its way through maize fields beside the quiet river Drina. In the woods, a cuckoo calls on a midsummer’s day. All is peaceful. 
As is so often the case, landscapes deceive. Twenty years ago, this idyllic setting was the scene of the worst crimes committed on European soil since 1945. The world looked the other way, as genocide was committed in and near the town of Srebrenica. 
Here, more than 8,000 men and boys were murdered in a series of executions and massacres in the days after Srebrenica fell to Bosnian-Serb forces on 11 July 1995. Almost a generation later, it is still unclear whether wounds have even begun to heal. 
The Serb forces who slaughtered their Muslim neighbours did so methodically and with a literal vengeance. On his arrival in the town, General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian-Serbs, told his men: “We give this town to the Serb nation… The time has come to take revenge on the Turks.” (As a small historical detail, Bosnian Muslims are in fact ethnically Slav.) 
The murder spree that followed was the culmination of a three-year nightmare for the besieged population of Srebrenica. 
Two years before the town’s fall, General Philippe Morillon visited Srebrenica and assured the assembled crowds that the UN would from then on keep them safe. The UN Security Council declared the town a UN-protected safe area. One former resident remembers his excitement on hearing Morillon that day: “I thought everybody should celebrate. It was like being born a second time.” 
The reality proved different. 
Left without UN protection 
When Bosnian-Serb forces decided to overrun the town, the UN refused to send planes which Dutch peacekeepers had requested. The peacekeepers argued with the Serbs. Then they fled. With all protection gone, the Bosnian-Serb forces were thorough in the days to come. At one point, filming of the killing was interrupted until somebody could drive to fetch a new camera battery, to continue recording the executions. 
In one of many haunting images from that time, Serb cameramen filmed a terrified Bosnian Muslim, plaintively shouting across the fields to urge his son – and all those with him – to emerge from their hiding places in the woods. 
“Nermin, I am here!” Ramo Osmanovic cried, while his captors looked on and dictated what he should say. “Come down, Nermin! There is nothing to fear!” The bodies of both father and son were later found in mass graves. 
The stories told by survivors are mind-numbing: “scenes from hell”, as one judge in The Hague later put it, “written on the darkest pages of history”. Those who emerged from their hiding places were shot, hanged or simply tortured and left on the ground to die – sometimes with booby traps which would kill those who might try to save them. Bulldozers were brought in to pile up the bodies, which were dumped in pits across the regio 
In some respects, it can feel as though we are now able to move on. The crimes, classified by international courts as genocide, will be commemorated in Srebrenica on 11 July, attended by thousands of survivors and by political leaders from around the world. And the UN Security Council was yesterday due to debate a UK-drafted resolution which talked of the need to address genocide. (Depressingly,  Serbia recently called on Russia to wield its veto; at the time of going to press, the outcome was unclear.) 
Srebrenica cannot, however, be seen in isolation. It was the culmination of a long and deadly series of events. Thus, to take just one small example: in July 1992, the Serb authorities in the town of Celinac in northern Bosnia published a series of edicts which made clear what was on the way. Non-Serbs were forbidden to move around the town after 4pm; forbidden to swim or fish in local rivers; forbidden to gather in groups of more than three; forbidden to sell or exchange apartments; forbidden to communicate with others outside the town… and so on, in language which seemed to have been lifted from the Nazis’ textbook. And finally: “Disrespect of this decision will have consequences in accordance with valid regulations.” 
The term “ethnic cleansing” began as an official euphemism. Quickly, like “Final Solution” half a century earlier, the euphemism became powerful shorthand for the deadly reality – a combination of fear, flight and murder. 
“We let them go…”  
Interviewing the Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at that time was surreal. On one occasion, he explained to me that there were no Serb snipers in the hills surrounding Sarajevo. (In reality, they terrorised the population of the Bosnian capital, as I and many  others had witnessed.) Ethnic cleansing of Muslims was, he said, humane. “We let them go,” he told me cheerfully, “with their luggage, and everything.” 
Concentration camps, mass rape, ethnic cleansing across the country. That was the pattern of the next few years. The world  wrung its hands, and kept talking about the next set of “peace agreements” in Geneva  and elsewhere. 
Finally, after three years of evasion, the killings at Srebrenica – and the international shame associated with them – proved a turning point. An agreement between all the parties to the Bosnian conflict was hammered out at an air base in Dayton, Ohio. The three-year war, which had cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, was finally over. It seemed that Bosnia, and Srebrenica, could begin to rebuild their lives. 
 
Today, there is a genocide memorial centre at Srebrenica. There are exhibitions inside the former factory that housed the UN base. A cemetery contains the bodies of thousands of those who were excavated from unmarked graves and have been reburied here in recent years. 
In some ways, there seems to have been an international reckoning, too. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader who expressed astonishment when I asked him if he might find himself in front of a war-crimes tribunal one day – he was “for peace”, he explained – was prosecuted for genocide and died behind bars. Mladic and Karadzic, after years in hiding, are both on trial in The Hague for genocide; Karadzic’s verdict is due in a few months’ time. Verdicts in those cases can hopefully bring a kind of closure. 
But, as a visit to Srebrenica today makes clear, there is still much to be done. Before the war, Srebrenica was three-quarters Muslim. Today, Serbs form the majority. And few of them are eager to acknowledge what happened here. 
A few miles north of Srebrenica is the village of Kravica. Just off the main road, a collection of buildings includes one bearing a faded sign proclaiming the Kravica Agricultural Co-operative, which was based here before the war. Cows and goats wander amid the agricultural equipment. At first glance, the buildings are unremarkable. It doesn’t take long, however, to notice that the walls are spattered with bullet holes. 
This was where more than 1,000 Muslim men and boys were brought from near Srebrenica and killed in 1995. General Mladic told the men they would be taken to Bosnian territory and united with their families. Instead, they were executed, with automatic weapons and hand grenades. A Kravica survivor, left for dead, described to the Hague war-crimes tribunal how he “walked over dead bodies” to survive. 
Denials and justifications 
All this is part of the historical record. Talk to locals, however, and they plead ignorance. A woman tending animals at the site in Kravica explains: she wasn’t here; she has heard nothing; she knows nothing. (Yes, she says, foreign visitors regularly come to visit the site, and ask questions. But she wasn’t here; she has heard nothing; she knows nothing.) Only when it comes to Karadzic and Mladic, does the woman become animated. They should never have been sent to The Hague, she says. The two men had simply been “defending the Serb people”. 
In a Serb café in Srebrenica, it’s a similar story. “We consider Mladic and Karadzic to be our heroes,” one 43-year-old man says. Mladic “saved thousands of civilian lives”. Anything else, another man says, is “lies and fabrications”. 
The coffee drinkers here are more interested in speaking about the arrest in Switzerland last month of Naser Oric, a Bosnian Muslim commander, who also stands accused of war crimes. There may have been a few “mistakes” on the Serb side, they acknowledge, but that is all. One man works at the factory next door to the memorial centre. No, he says, he has never visited the exhibition to learn the facts about Srebrenica. 
The reluctance to confront truth after terrible crimes is, of course, nothing new. Martha Gellhorn reported from Germany in April 1945, with heavy sarcasm: “No one is a Nazi. No one ever was… We have nothing against the Jews, we always got on well with them… It should, we feel, be set to music.” 
But quite apart from the obvious difference in the scale of the crimes committed – millions versus “merely” tens of thousands of civilians dead – there is another important contrast between Germany after 1945 and the Balkans today. Two decades after the Second World War, the development of a new generation meant Germany was beginning to ask tough questions about its own history. 
Chancellor Willy Brandt (who had personally resisted Nazism from the start) visited Warsaw in 1970 and dropped to his knees in the ghetto to express repentance, the famous and historic Kniefall. This was against the grain: opinion polls showed that most Germans felt he shouldn’t have apologised. But Brandt’s remarkable gesture marked the beginning of an historical honesty which provides a cornerstone for the stable, peaceful Germany that we now know. 
In today’s Serb and Bosnian-Serb leadership, by contrast, there is little sign of an emerging Willy Brandt – a leader who understands the need for more truth for the sake of all sides, and who is ready to take political risks to get there. 
There are rays of half-light. Milorad Dodik, the President of the Republika Srpska – the Bosnian-Serb entity of which Srebrenica now forms a part – visited the town in April, and talked of “crimes” committed, and said he was “sorry for all the victims”. But at the same time, he didn’t sound that sorry – and more recently, he described the focus on Srebrenica as “the greatest deception of the 20th century”. 
From Belgrade, the messages have been equally mixed. Tomislav Nikolic, the Serb President, gave an interview in 2013 in which he apologised for the first time for “crimes” committed, in some respects a major step forward; at the same time, he emphasised that this was not genocide. This is more than just a detail. Both literally and metaphorically, the leaders of Serbia and the Republika Srpska refuse to admit where the bodies are buried. 
Another massacre site discovered 
There is little political backing – still less political pressure – for people to come clean about the past. Rather, the contrary. A large massacre site in northern Bosnia, discovered and excavated in the past two years, provides a vivid example of the continuing silence. 
Hundreds of bodies were uncovered at the mining complex of Tomasica, close to the notorious camps of Omarska and Trnopolje. The mass grave was discovered only after one of those involved in the killings said he could no longer stay silent. He said he was “haunted” by the eyes of a girl whom he had killed 20 years earlier. 
A reporter from the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, a regional NGO pressing for truth, justice and reconciliation across the region, visited Tomasica after excavations had begun. Nobody was ready to talk about the historical events. One man quoted a Bosnian proverb: “Stay silent, someone can hear you.” 
That reluctance to speak out, on Srebrenica and other killings across the country, means that too many are left not just with the loss of a loved one, but also with the double pain created by forced disappearance – where relatives, without a grave to visit, are unable to achieve closure. 
On the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, Amnesty International is launching a campaign for the estimated 8,000 people still missing all across Bosnia, including 1,000 from Srebrenica. But that will be an uphill battle in the current context, not least because of political games being played by politicians on all sides, in Bosnia and Serbia alike. 
Twenty-three years ago, the cover headline for a piece that I wrote for The Independent Magazine ran, “Hope Dies in Sarajevo”, and I reported on what the Bosnians perceived as the world’s determination to look away at that time. The world failed then, by refusing to exert pressure when pressure was needed. These days, Bosnia can seem deceptively quiet. But if we seek any kind of stability in the Balkans, the need for truth and justice today remains as urgent as ever before.

Srebrenica. A drive through eastern Bosnia seems to be full of sleepy Balkan charm. The landscape is one of wooded hills, small farmsteads, abundant plum orchards. The road winds its way through maize fields beside the quiet river Drina. In the woods, a cuckoo calls on a midsummer’s day. All is peaceful. 
,  
As is so often the case, landscapes deceive. Twenty years ago, this idyllic setting was the scene of the worst crimes committed on European soil since 1945. The world looked the other way, as genocide was committed in and near the town of Srebrenica. 
,  
Here, more than 8,000 men and boys were murdered in a series of executions and massacres in the days after Srebrenica fell to Bosnian-Serb forces on 11 July 1995. Almost a generation later, it is still unclear whether wounds have even begun to heal. 
,  
The Serb forces who slaughtered their Muslim neighbours did so methodically and with a literal vengeance. On his arrival in the town, General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian-Serbs, told his men: “We give this town to the Serb nation… The time has come to take revenge on the Turks.” (As a small historical detail, Bosnian Muslims are in fact ethnically Slav.) 
,  
The murder spree that followed was the culmination of a three-year nightmare for the besieged population of Srebrenica. 
,  
Two years before the town’s fall, General Philippe Morillon visited Srebrenica and assured the assembled crowds that the UN would from then on keep them safe. The UN Security Council declared the town a UN-protected safe area. One former resident remembers his excitement on hearing Morillon that day: “I thought everybody should celebrate. It was like being born a second time.” 
,  
The reality proved different. 
,  
Left without UN protection 
,  
When Bosnian-Serb forces decided to overrun the town, the UN refused to send planes which Dutch peacekeepers had requested. The peacekeepers argued with the Serbs. Then they fled. With all protection gone, the Bosnian-Serb forces were thorough in the days to come. At one point, filming of the killing was interrupted until somebody could drive to fetch a new camera battery, to continue recording the executions. 
,  
In one of many haunting images from that time, Serb cameramen filmed a terrified Bosnian Muslim, plaintively shouting across the fields to urge his son – and all those with him – to emerge from their hiding places in the woods. 
,  
“Nermin, I am here!” Ramo Osmanovic cried, while his captors looked on and dictated what he should say. “Come down, Nermin! There is nothing to fear!” The bodies of both father and son were later found in mass graves. 
,  
The stories told by survivors are mind-numbing: “scenes from hell”, as one judge in The Hague later put it, “written on the darkest pages of history”. Those who emerged from their hiding places were shot, hanged or simply tortured and left on the ground to die – sometimes with booby traps which would kill those who might try to save them. Bulldozers were brought in to pile up the bodies, which were dumped in pits across the regio 
,  
In some respects, it can feel as though we are now able to move on. The crimes, classified by international courts as genocide, will be commemorated in Srebrenica on 11 July, attended by thousands of survivors and by political leaders from around the world. And the UN Security Council was yesterday due to debate a UK-drafted resolution which talked of the need to address genocide. (Depressingly,  Serbia recently called on Russia to wield its veto; at the time of going to press, the outcome was unclear.) 
,  
Srebrenica cannot, however, be seen in isolation. It was the culmination of a long and deadly series of events. Thus, to take just one small example: in July 1992, the Serb authorities in the town of Celinac in northern Bosnia published a series of edicts which made clear what was on the way. Non-Serbs were forbidden to move around the town after 4pm; forbidden to swim or fish in local rivers; forbidden to gather in groups of more than three; forbidden to sell or exchange apartments; forbidden to communicate with others outside the town… and so on, in language which seemed to have been lifted from the Nazis’ textbook. And finally: “Disrespect of this decision will have consequences in accordance with valid regulations.” 
,  
The term “ethnic cleansing” began as an official euphemism. Quickly, like “Final Solution” half a century earlier, the euphemism became powerful shorthand for the deadly reality – a combination of fear, flight and murder. 
,  
“We let them go…”  
,  
Interviewing the Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at that time was surreal. On one occasion, he explained to me that there were no Serb snipers in the hills surrounding Sarajevo. (In reality, they terrorised the population of the Bosnian capital, as I and many  others had witnessed.) Ethnic cleansing of Muslims was, he said, humane. “We let them go,” he told me cheerfully, “with their luggage, and everything.” 
,  
Concentration camps, mass rape, ethnic cleansing across the country. That was the pattern of the next few years. The world  wrung its hands, and kept talking about the next set of “peace agreements” in Geneva  and elsewhere. 
,  
Finally, after three years of evasion, the killings at Srebrenica – and the international shame associated with them – proved a turning point. An agreement between all the parties to the Bosnian conflict was hammered out at an air base in Dayton, Ohio. The three-year war, which had cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, was finally over. It seemed that Bosnia, and Srebrenica, could begin to rebuild their lives. 
,  
 
,  
Today, there is a genocide memorial centre at Srebrenica. There are exhibitions inside the former factory that housed the UN base. A cemetery contains the bodies of thousands of those who were excavated from unmarked graves and have been reburied here in recent years. 
,  
In some ways, there seems to have been an international reckoning, too. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader who expressed astonishment when I asked him if he might find himself in front of a war-crimes tribunal one day – he was “for peace”, he explained – was prosecuted for genocide and died behind bars. Mladic and Karadzic, after years in hiding, are both on trial in The Hague for genocide; Karadzic’s verdict is due in a few months’ time. Verdicts in those cases can hopefully bring a kind of closure. 
,  
But, as a visit to Srebrenica today makes clear, there is still much to be done. Before the war, Srebrenica was three-quarters Muslim. Today, Serbs form the majority. And few of them are eager to acknowledge what happened here. 
,  
A few miles north of Srebrenica is the village of Kravica. Just off the main road, a collection of buildings includes one bearing a faded sign proclaiming the Kravica Agricultural Co-operative, which was based here before the war. Cows and goats wander amid the agricultural equipment. At first glance, the buildings are unremarkable. It doesn’t take long, however, to notice that the walls are spattered with bullet holes. 
,  
This was where more than 1,000 Muslim men and boys were brought from near Srebrenica and killed in 1995. General Mladic told the men they would be taken to Bosnian territory and united with their families. Instead, they were executed, with automatic weapons and hand grenades. A Kravica survivor, left for dead, described to the Hague war-crimes tribunal how he “walked over dead bodies” to survive. 
,  
Denials and justifications 
,  
All this is part of the historical record. Talk to locals, however, and they plead ignorance. A woman tending animals at the site in Kravica explains: she wasn’t here; she has heard nothing; she knows nothing. (Yes, she says, foreign visitors regularly come to visit the site, and ask questions. But she wasn’t here; she has heard nothing; she knows nothing.) Only when it comes to Karadzic and Mladic, does the woman become animated. They should never have been sent to The Hague, she says. The two men had simply been “defending the Serb people”. 
,  
In a Serb café in Srebrenica, it’s a similar story. “We consider Mladic and Karadzic to be our heroes,” one 43-year-old man says. Mladic “saved thousands of civilian lives”. Anything else, another man says, is “lies and fabrications”. 
,  
The coffee drinkers here are more interested in speaking about the arrest in Switzerland last month of Naser Oric, a Bosnian Muslim commander, who also stands accused of war crimes. There may have been a few “mistakes” on the Serb side, they acknowledge, but that is all. One man works at the factory next door to the memorial centre. No, he says, he has never visited the exhibition to learn the facts about Srebrenica. 
,  
The reluctance to confront truth after terrible crimes is, of course, nothing new. Martha Gellhorn reported from Germany in April 1945, with heavy sarcasm: “No one is a Nazi. No one ever was… We have nothing against the Jews, we always got on well with them… It should, we feel, be set to music.” 
,  
But quite apart from the obvious difference in the scale of the crimes committed – millions versus “merely” tens of thousands of civilians dead – there is another important contrast between Germany after 1945 and the Balkans today. Two decades after the Second World War, the development of a new generation meant Germany was beginning to ask tough questions about its own history. 
,  
Chancellor Willy Brandt (who had personally resisted Nazism from the start) visited Warsaw in 1970 and dropped to his knees in the ghetto to express repentance, the famous and historic Kniefall. This was against the grain: opinion polls showed that most Germans felt he shouldn’t have apologised. But Brandt’s remarkable gesture marked the beginning of an historical honesty which provides a cornerstone for the stable, peaceful Germany that we now know. 
,  
In today’s Serb and Bosnian-Serb leadership, by contrast, there is little sign of an emerging Willy Brandt – a leader who understands the need for more truth for the sake of all sides, and who is ready to take political risks to get there. 
,  
There are rays of half-light. Milorad Dodik, the President of the Republika Srpska – the Bosnian-Serb entity of which Srebrenica now forms a part – visited the town in April, and talked of “crimes” committed, and said he was “sorry for all the victims”. But at the same time, he didn’t sound that sorry – and more recently, he described the focus on Srebrenica as “the greatest deception of the 20th century”. 
,  
From Belgrade, the messages have been equally mixed. Tomislav Nikolic, the Serb President, gave an interview in 2013 in which he apologised for the first time for “crimes” committed, in some respects a major step forward; at the same time, he emphasised that this was not genocide. This is more than just a detail. Both literally and metaphorically, the leaders of Serbia and the Republika Srpska refuse to admit where the bodies are buried. 
,  
Another massacre site discovered 
,  
There is little political backing – still less political pressure – for people to come clean about the past. Rather, the contrary. A large massacre site in northern Bosnia, discovered and excavated in the past two years, provides a vivid example of the continuing silence. 
,  
Hundreds of bodies were uncovered at the mining complex of Tomasica, close to the notorious camps of Omarska and Trnopolje. The mass grave was discovered only after one of those involved in the killings said he could no longer stay silent. He said he was “haunted” by the eyes of a girl whom he had killed 20 years earlier. 
,  
A reporter from the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, a regional NGO pressing for truth, justice and reconciliation across the region, visited Tomasica after excavations had begun. Nobody was ready to talk about the historical events. One man quoted a Bosnian proverb: “Stay silent, someone can hear you.” 
,  
That reluctance to speak out, on Srebrenica and other killings across the country, means that too many are left not just with the loss of a loved one, but also with the double pain created by forced disappearance – where relatives, without a grave to visit, are unable to achieve closure. 
,  
On the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, Amnesty International is launching a campaign for the estimated 8,000 people still missing all across Bosnia, including 1,000 from Srebrenica. But that will be an uphill battle in the current context, not least because of political games being played by politicians on all sides, in Bosnia and Serbia alike.

THAT’S WHEN I REALIZED THEY WERE ALL DEAD.” – Khalil Abed Hassan Ammar, who lost three of his...","Over 50 days, both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and other serious breaches of international law. To date, neither side has held anyone to account. 
During the war, Israeli forces fired tens of thousands of artillery and tank shells into densely populated residential areas, and launched air strikes on homes across the Gaza Strip, killing families inside in many cases. They struck schools sheltering civilians and attacked hospitals and medical workers, including ambulance staff trying to evacuate the dead and wounded. 
On the other side, Palestinian armed groups fired thousands of rockets and mortars towards Israel, and also stored and fired munitions from residential areas of Gaza. Hamas forces executed at least 23 people in Gaza they accused of “collaborating”, and arrested and tortured others. 
Today, we’re calling on the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to genuinely investigate all possible crimes and prosecute those responsible. 
We’ve worked with Forensic Architecture to create an interactive online map and database of Israeli attacks on Gaza during the conflict. Using data collected by Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights and witness testimonies collected by Amnesty International, the Gaza Platform documents significant patterns in the Israeli attacks which point to likely war crimes. 
 
The evidence is overwhelming. We cannot wait for more violence to destroy more lives – we need action now. Please tweet the three influential politicians below with our suggested tweets to keep the pressure on. 
 
The evidence suggests that the Israeli military had a deliberate policy of targeting family homes. They continued to target homes throughout the war, even after it became clear how many civilians were being killed. Over the 50 days, more than 19,000 homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. 
Just one example is the Abu Jame’ family, whose three-storey home in Bani Suheila, east of Khan Younis, was bombed without warning by an Israeli aircraft on 20 July 2014, killing 25 family members. “Our house had nothing to do with the fighting,” Tawfiq Abu Jame’ told us. “No one from the family was involved in the resistance, not then, not ever.” 
There is also a pattern of attacks on health workers and facilities. In some cases, the Israeli army repeatedly fired at clearly marked ambulances and paramedics wearing recognizable fluorescent vests. 
Paramedic Mohammad al-Abadlah was killed by Israeli gunfire while attempting to rescue an injured man on 25 July 2014 in al-Qarara. “Suddenly we were being fired at directly,” his co-worker Hassan al-Attal told us. “My colleague screamed and said ‘I’ve been shot’… When colleagues got out to try to reach him, they too were fired at.” 
 
Have they genuinely investigated the crimes? 
Over the past year, the Israeli and Palestinian authorities have conducted only limited investigations, which have not been independent or effective. 
The Hamas authorities have said they are investigating the killings of alleged “collaborators” in Gaza. The Israeli military is looking into some of the alleged crimes by its forces, but such investigations in the past have only served to shield those responsible. 
In both cases, they are claiming to investigate their own possible crimes, in processes that lack credibility. 
Right now, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, which investigates and prosecutes war crimes when governments are unwilling, is considering opening a full investigation into alleged war crimes committed by both sides. We now have an opportunity to move towards bringing those responsible to justice.  
 
In late June, an independent UN Commission of Inquiry into the war found that both Israel and Palestinian armed groups had committed possible war crimes, confirming previous reports by local and international human rights organizations. 
It was an important step in the fight for justice. But now we need to keep the pressure on to make change happen and ensure the Commission’s recommendations are put into action. 
Until now, some influential governments – in particular the USA, UK and Canada – have blocked moves which could press Israel and Palestine to take action. But today these states have the power to help ensure the Israeli and Palestinian authorities: 
1. Genuinely investigate war crimes and other serious violations of international law	2. Prosecute those responsible in fair trials	3. Co-operate with the International Criminal Court.

When I called my mother from prison to tell her I’d been pardoned after 10 years in jail, she fainted. I was told they had to pour water on her to revive her. Later, when she saw me for the first time after all those years in jail, she grabbed me and held me so tight. She wouldn’t let go for almost 15 minutes.

Initially I couldn’t even speak, I was so happy. The day after hearing the news, I celebrated in prison by organizing a football match between death-row inmates and other prison inmates. I’d been the death-row team football coach during my time in prison. We won the match 3-0! Everyone was so happy to play.	    	That Sunday I went to the prison church. I bought some biscuits and fruit juice to share with other inmates in church and an announcement was made that I was being released. Everyone was happy. I had friends in prison; I had been teaching English and Maths to fellow inmates and those students who were keen became my friends.	    	I was released a few days later. That first evening at home, my mother prepared a special dish – Okro soup with beef. The whole family ate together at the dining table. Afterwards, there was a party with family friends and we sang songs, played music and prayed.

I waited for it, and then realized that it was not a dream, but in fact I really am free. When I realized that, I felt freedom deep in my spirit. Things had changed for good. I went back to sleep and slept until 10am, fully enjoying my ‘freedom sleep’. My family came to wake me up but I told them to let me sleep longer. It was such a good sleep.	    “I’m alive, I’m not a ghost!”	   	In those first days of freedom I bumped into an old school friend and he looked at me like he’d seen a ghost. We have a local belief that if you pour sand on a spirit it will vanish, and he started to pick up sand from the ground and pour it on my body! I told him – ‘don’t pour sand on me, I’m alive, I’m not a ghost!’ At that, he touched me and hugged me: he thought I had been executed. He told me he would never forget the last time he saw me before my arrest 10 years ago.	    	At home, everything felt strange to me, even though I’m so relieved to be free. Lots of things have changed in the 10 years since I was arrested: new bridges have been built and the use of laptop computers and phones is common now.	    I’m joining the fight against torture	   	My plans now I’m free are to continue my education and get as far as I always dreamt – I want to be a doctor to fulfill my late father’s wishes. But I’ll also be a human rights activist and help others who face the same challenges that I did. I have already filled out an application form and had a passport photo taken – the requirements for becoming a volunteer activist with HURSDEF. The Director, Justine, welcomed me warmly as ‘Comrade Moses Akatugba’. I told him: Justine, I’m joining the fight against torture so that others will not go through the pain that I did.	    	On 28 May 2015, Moses Akatugba, a  Nigerian death-row inmate, was pardoned after nearly 10 years in jail.

, 	In those first days of freedom I bumped into an old school friend and he looked at me like he’d seen a ghost. We have a local belief that if you pour sand on a spirit it will vanish, and he started to pick up sand from the ground and pour it on my body! I told him – ‘don’t pour sand on me, I’m alive, I’m not a ghost!’ At that, he touched me and hugged me: he thought I had been executed. He told me he would never forget the last time he saw me before my arrest 10 years ago. 
, 	     
, 	At home, everything felt strange to me, even though I’m so relieved to be free. Lots of things have changed in the 10 years since I was arrested: new bridges have been built and the use of laptop computers and phones is common now.

, 	My plans now I’m free are to continue my education and get as far as I always dreamt – I want to be a doctor to fulfill my late father’s wishes. But I’ll also be a human rights activist and help others who face the same challenges that I did. I have already filled out an application form and had a passport photo taken – the requirements for becoming a volunteer activist with HURSDEF. The Director, Justine, welcomed me warmly as ‘Comrade Moses Akatugba’. I told him: Justine, I’m joining the fight against torture so that others will not go through the pain that I did.

,  
Just after 4pm yesterday, Amnesty International received an email from the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which hears cases related to UK intelligence agencies. The message was brief but it dropped a bombshell. 
,  
It said there had been a mistake in the tribunal’s judgment 10 days earlier in a case brought by 10 human rights organizations against the UK’s mass surveillance programmes. Contrary to the original ruling, our communications at Amnesty International had, in fact, been under illegal surveillance by GCHQ, the UK’s signals intelligence agency. Incredibly, the initial judgment had named the wrong organization – the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights – and it took 10 days to correct the astonishing mix-up. 
,  
The news brought an unexpected and bizarre sense of relief: we had strongly suspected that we were being spied on by GCHQ but having it confirmed in court means we weren’t just being paranoid. Of course, GCHQ and highly likely its US counterpart, the NSA, spy on a range of organizations besides Amnesty. The same IPT judgment had revealed GCHQ’s unlawful surveillance of the South African Legal Resources Centre. 
,  
Leaks by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden show that GCHQ, and the NSA, spied on Doctors of the World and UNICEF. Many more charities may have been spied on – the fact that the IPT did not find in favour of the eight other organizations bringing the case does not necessarily mean their communications were untouched – perhaps they were, but the Tribunal considered it had been done legally. 
,  
This whole process brings to light the problem with the so-called “oversight” of UK surveillance programmes. In the UK, a government minister, not a judge, issues surveillance warrants, so from the very start the executive branch of government authorizes its own spying. 
,  
As the only judicial body with authority to examine the practices of UK intelligence agencies, the IPT conducts nearly all its deliberations in private. And it simply accepted the government’s position of refusing to publicly confirm or deny any specific surveillance practices or programmes. As claimants against the British government, the 10 organizations, including Amnesty, did not see the secret policies governing surveillance practices, save for a tiny snippet, which was brought before the judges in secret sessions that only the government lawyers could attend. 
,  
The only reason we even found out that our communications have been intercepted, accessed and stored, is because GCHQ had stored these communications for longer than its internal guidelines allowed. 
,  
The IPT issues only two kinds of findings. One possibility is that it finds in favour of a claimant, like it did with Amnesty, where it considered that our communications were unlawfully intercepted. However, we do not know when this happened, what it was about, how many times it happened, what has been done with the information intercepted, whether it has been shared with other governments, and whether it is still happening. We’re still in the dark. 
,  
The other finding that the IPT made – for eight of the 10 organizations – is that it had made no determination of illegality. So, either these organizations’ communications were not intercepted at all, or they were intercepted, but in a manner the Tribunal deems lawful. Again, we’re in the dark about which is true. 
,  
This bring us to the urgent need for reform of UK surveillance legislation. Last month, David Anderson, the UK government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, slammed RIPA – the main law underpinning surveillance powers. In his estimation it has been “obscure since its inception, [and] has been patched up so many times as to make it incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates”. He’s called for a new law that is “comprehensible” and judicial authorization of interception warrants. 
,  
The government response so far has not been encouraging: Prime Minister David Cameron apparently wants to keep the power to issue warrants within his cabinet. It seems that even one of the most basic principles of the rule of law, judicial warrants, is too much for the British government to accept. 
,  
Our concerns about mass surveillance are not limited to human rights organizations, although this is already very worrying. Mass surveillance is invasive and a dangerous overreach of government power into our private lives and freedom of expression. In specific circumstances it can also put lives at risk, be used to discredit people or interfere with investigations into human rights violations by governments. 
,  
We have good reasons to believe that the British government is interested in our work. Over the past few years we have investigated possible war crimes by UK and US forces in Iraq, Western government involvement in the CIA’s torture scheme known as the extraordinary rendition programme, and the callous killing of civilians in US drone strikes in Pakistan: it was recently revealed that GCHQ may have provided assistance for US drone attacks. 
,  
The obfuscation, secrecy and determination to avoid any meaningful oversight is worthy of a tin-pot dictatorship. It is time for serious public scrutiny of the behaviour of the British government. We need to know what surveillance programmes the government is operating, what spying they consider to be fair game, and why. 
,  
We urgently need legislative reform to avoid future excesses by the government and its intelligence agencies. 
,  
But there must also be accountability for past actions: how did the government of a country that’s a self-professed champion of human rights and democracy allow its spooks to run a huge mass surveillance programme, and with almost no meaningful oversight? How did it allow spying on medical charities, children’s charities and on human rights organizations? How did the people in government who knew or should have known let this happen? 
,  
The UK government must establish an independent inquiry, and quickly.

Wondering what your signatures, letters, emails and phone calls have achieved so far this year? 
Here we reflect on some of our biggest human rights wins in 2015. 
  
After nearly 10 years in jail, and over 800,000 letters of support from activists around the world, Moses Akatugba’s life was spared. Emmanuel Uduaghan, the Governor of Delta State, used his last day in office to grant Moses a total pardon on 28 May 2015. 
Moses was imprisoned and tortured in 2005 and later sentenced to death by hanging for stealing mobile phones – a crime he denies. He thanked everyone who supported him: “Amnesty International members and activists are my heroes.” 
He also promised to become a human rights activist himself: “I’m joining the fight against torture so that others will not go through the pain that I did.” 
When as many as 1,200 refugees and migrants drowned in two shipwrecks during just one week in April, hundreds of thousands of people stood up to protest. And finally, Europe’s politicians faced the fact that the Mediterranean Sea is turning into a cemetery. 
After holding emergency meetings it proposed a new plan which includes stepping up search and rescue operations. This could mean a small, important step forward – if all member states back it fully. 
Thank you to the around 500,000 people who signed our #SOSEurope campaign petition, sending a loud and clear message to EU leaders. 
Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce full civil marriage equality through a referendum for all its people, regardless of their sexual orientation, on 23 May – captured in the image at the top of this story. Amnesty Ireland campaigned for a Yes vote: “This decision is enormously important,” said its Executive Director, Colm O’Gorman. 
“It will obviously have profound significance to people here in Ireland, but it will also echo around the world. It sends a message to LGBTI people everywhere that they, their relationships and their families matter.” 
The Chinese authorities released five women’s rights activists on bail on 13 April, following a worldwide campaign for their freedom. Amnesty coined the #FreetheFive hashtag soon after the women – Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting and Zheng Churan – were arrested and detained on 7 March. Their “crime”? Planning to campaign publicly against sexual harassment on International Women’s Day. 
“The decision to release all five women is an encouraging breakthrough,” said Amnesty’s China researcher, William Nee. “The authorities must now follow through and drop all charges and restrictions against the women.” 
Transgender people in Norway should no longer be forced to trade invasive treatment for having their gender legally recognized, an expert committee announced on 10 April 2015. This followed our global campaigning for John Jeanette Solstad Remø – a transgender woman and vocal activist featured in Amnesty’s Write for Rights 2014 campaign. 
“This is everything I have dreamt of and hoped for,” she told us. “It was worth the fight. Without Amnesty’s support we wouldn’t have got to where we are today.” 
The Philippines police announced in late March that letters sent by a “human rights organisation” – which we can confidently say is Amnesty International – have prompted them to investigate the shocking torture of Jerryme Corre, who was electrocuted, punched and threatened with death. 
Amnesty Philippines delivered thousands of signatures collected during our Write for Rights 2014 campaign to the police on 27 March. Immediately afterwards, the police informed Jerryme and his family that an investigation would be opened. And on 6 April, Amnesty attended the first investigation hearing alongside Jerryme and his representatives. 
When Omar Khadr left a courthouse in Alberta, Canada with his long-time lawyer Dennis Edney on 7 May 2015, it was his first taste of freedom after almost 13 years behind bars – mostly spent in the notorious US Guantánamo prison. 
Omar was just 15 when US forces captured him in Afghanistan in 2002. Amnesty activists worldwide have campaigned for his rights ever since – you can send him a message of support right now. 
An Italian court ruled in May that moving Romani families to an ethnically segregated camp outside Rome was illegal. This landmark verdict follows years of Amnesty campaigning alongside others to stop Italy’s Romani people being forcibly evicted, segregated and discriminated against. 
The Rome authorities effectively forced many Roma families into an isolated camp of pre-fabricated containers in 2012. Many had their existing homes destroyed. Thanks to everyone who supported our campaign – we will keep pushing for Romani people to get the same housing options as everyone else. 
Nebraska voted to abolish the death penalty on 27 May 2015, becoming the 19th US state without this inhumane punishment. “This couldn’t have happened without the hard work of groups dedicated to ending state barbarism,” said Christy Hargesheimer, Death Penalty Action Coordinator for Amnesty USA. 
“The tidal wave of abolition is continuing to sweep over the United States, and soon the death penalty will be relegated to the history books where it belongs. Who’s next?” 
 
As soon as we found out that letters were not being passed to Erkin Musaev, tortured and imprisoned since 2006 in Uzbekistan, we complained to the prison director. Erkin was then allowed to read a few letters in the presence of prison administration staff, before giving them back. 
Erkin and his family say a huge “thank you!” to all Amnesty activists who have sent them messages of support, including during Write for Rights 2014: “Erkin says that every letter means a lot to him and gives him strength, optimism and faith.” 
 
After a global social media outcry, Asma, Mariam and Alyazia al-Suwaidi were released from secret detention on 15 May. Having tweeted about their brother’s unfair trial, the sisters were questioned by United Arab Emirates police in February and disappeared for three months. 
“These three women should never have been detained,” stated Amnesty’s Said Boumedouha. “It is a chilling act of repression for the state to silence activists’ families by locking them up for months, with no access to their loved ones or the outside world.” 
#LoveWins became the global hashtag of choice on 26 June, when the US Supreme Court delivered a historic ruling affirming same-sex couples’ legal right to marry. 
“This is a joyous day not just for loving and committed same-sex couples, but for everyone who believes in human rights and equality for all,” said Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA. 
“The ability to marry the partner of your choice and raise a family is a human right enshrined in international law. This long-awaited and significant decision affirms that same-sex couples and their families deserve the same respect and recognition as anyone else.” 
 
  
Bhekithemba Makhubu and Thulani Maseko were finally released in Swaziland on 30 June after spending 15 months in prison. Thousands of Amnesty activists from around the world had campaigned for the two prisoners of conscience, sending thousands of letters to support them. Both their families thanked Amnesty’s members for remembering them during their darkest days. 
Bheki and Thulani were imprisoned in March 2014 and were serving a two-year sentence for contempt of court after a blatantly unfair trial. They were convicted for publishing articles in The Nation magazine which raised concerns about the lack of judicial independence and integrity in Swaziland. 
Following pressure from Amnesty, the Cameroon authorities started releasing 84 children on 24 June. They had been detained for six months after being rounded up last December during a raid by the security forces on a Quranic school, carried out under the guise of countering the armed group Boko Haram. 
On 30 June, we were able to confirm that all the children had been released from the detention centre for minors in the town of Maroua.

A landmark ruling from the Supreme Court in the United States calling for marriage equality in all 50 states! A successful referendum on marriage equality in Ireland! Discriminatory laws challenged and repealed in a number of countries, and peaceful Pride marches in cities where they’ve been met with violence and counter marches in the past. We have much to celebrate during Pride this summer. 
,  
Pride season is in full swing. As I type this blog I am gearing up to coordinate Amnesty’s contingent in Toronto Pride this Sunday. Amnesty marches in Pride parades throughout Canada and around the world. We promote our actions at festivals and info-fairs, and we honour the lives lost to homophobia and transphobia at human rights vigils. Some of us are Amnesty activists who are members of the LGBTI community; many are allies marching in solidarity with the LGBTI community. All of us stand firmly against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and all of us stand firmly for the right to loudly, proudly, and publicly be who we are. 
,  
Pride is a celebration, but it is also a time to remember that discrimination still exists in Canada and around the world, and it is a time to re-commit ourselves to ending homophobia and transphobia in law and practice. In the past year we have seen draconian and discriminatory laws passed criminalizing homosexuality in a number of countries. We have seen a heartbreaking number of transgender people murdered, go missing, or be pushed to suicide. We continue to see LGBTI people imprisoned and murdered in a number of countries because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. And we still have a ways to go here in Canada. Bill C-279, which aimed to protect Canada’s transgender communities from violence and discrimination, was needlessly held up in the Senate and died when Parliament adjourned for the summer (and the upcoming federal election) this week.  
,  
Pride is a time to be good to each other and stand in solidarity. This includes recognizing the beautiful differences we have and celebrating what makes our community diverse. It also includes being a good ally, and ensuring we are doing our utmost to promote equality and dignity, and confront homophobia and transphobia. It means being a good friend, and learning the ways we can best support each other. Internationally, it means letting activists in countries like Uganda know that they are not alone–in Uganda, we endanger activists if we directly target the government with our actions–but we can still have an impact by showing activists that we stand with them.  
,  
From the perspective of a gay man, I think we should be aware of violence against woman and recognize how gender factors into violence. Transgender women are some of the most vulnerable in our community. Gender expression is at the root of much of the violence targeting gay men. Effeminate gay men are more likely to be the targets of violence and abuse. This discrimination extends into the larger LGBTI community where effeminate gay men and transgender people may face discrimination from their peers. We need to recognize our role in perpetuating discriminatory attitudes and be cognizant of our words and actions. We need to be better allies.

As the International Criminal Court (ICC) opens its Assembly of States Parties – the periodic gathering of all the countries who have ratified the Court’s statute – in The Hague today, it does so with a bloody nose. 
,  
The Court was yet again met with contempt this month by South Africa’s failure to cooperate with its arrest warrants for one of its longest running fugitives, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan. 
,  
On 15 June, South Africa’s government failed to obey an order from its own high court to prevent al-Bashir from leaving the country. The order had been made while the court decided whether to compel the government to fulfil its international and constitutional obligations to uphold two ICC warrants for the arrest of Sudanese President al-Bashir. The Sudanese leader, who was visiting Johannesburg for an African Union Summit, faces seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as three counts of genocide in Darfur. 
,  
South Africa joins a long list of states that have failed to arrest and surrender al-Bashir to the ICC to face trial – each time it happens is another betrayal for the hundreds of thousands of victims killed during the Darfur conflict. 
,  
This latest failure, though, was a particularly poignant slap in the face. Ahead of the AU Summit, many of us thought that al-Bashir would not dare to come to South Africa, which is not only a founding member of the ICC, but has also enacted a fairly strong national law to implement the Court’s jurisdiction nationally. But he did come and he was welcomed by South African government officials!   
,  
Anticipating this might happen, the Southern African Litigation Centre, a prominent national human rights group, acted quickly to bring a legal challenge to the Gauteng High Court calling for his arrest and surrender to the ICC. In a strong statement that there should be no impunity for crimes under international law, the court first issued an interim order that Al Bashir not be allowed to leave South Africa until the matter was finally decided. Presiding judge Honourable Mr Hans Fabricius made it clear that all the South African government agencies were directed to take all necessary steps to prevent Bashir from leaving the country. 
,  
But this order was never complied with. 
,  
As early as the next morning the court sat to decide whether the South African government should arrest President Bashir and hand him over to the ICC. While they were meeting, the media broke the news that al-Bashir had allegedly already left the country, but the South African government denied this. 
,  
“To the best of our knowledge as government, he is in the country” was the response to questions in court. At times it bordered on the absurd: “…he could be in the hotel room resting, or shopping” the State Counsel told the judge at one point. 
,  
What was at the crux of the court debate was whether immunity or impunity should prevail in South Africa. South Africa’s government argued that diplomatic immunity for a serving head of state had precedence, even at the expense of impunity for such serious crimes as genocide and crimes against humanity for which al-Bashir is wanted. But South Africa’s judiciary was clear and unambiguous about its government’s legal obligation to fight impunity and to ensure justice for international crimes even when the perpetrator belongs to the club of leaders. 
,  
The court held that the conduct of the South African government in failing to “take steps to arrest and or detain” al-Bashir” was “inconsistent” with South Africa’s constitution. The court also confirmed South Africa’s obligation towards the ICC by declaring that the government was “compelled to take all reasonable steps to prepare to arrest President al-Bashir … pending a formal request for his surrender from the International Criminal Court”. 
,  
But seconds after this judgment, the government of South Africa did an about-face and confirmed that the fugitive had indeed left the country. In essence, while immunity was defeated in court, the South African government allowed impunity to prevail. 
,  
The end game was tragic in many ways but also a victory in others. South Africa’s justice system and civil society stood their ground, standing on the side of the victims, upholding international justice and the rule of law. Once again, any ambiguity about South Africa’s legal obligation to fight impunity and to ensure justice for international crimes has been cleared by the judiciary. 
,  
In South Africa’s case, even a national court ruling failed to prevent the government from upending the rule of law and refusing to comply with the ICC arrest warrants. But all the same, it sends a powerful message that we as Africans who stand for justice do so on all levels, and we will continue to do so, no matter what some of our political leaders might say. 
,  
Maybe Africa as a whole has not yet reached a golden era of support for international justice. But there are promising signs that not all is bleak, and Amnesty International will continue to work with NGOs and governments across the continent to ensure that perpetrators of the worst crimes under international law – no matter where in the world they’re from – are brought to justice.

We have shone a light on torture taking place in Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Uzbekistan. In each of these countries we have campaigned alongside families of torture survivors and NGO partners, and we have seen results. Here are a few of the highlights. 
,  
,  
October 15, 2014 – Mexico releases Honduran torture victim and prisoner of conscience, Ángel Amilcar Colón without charge after more than five years of pre-trial detention. 20,000 people signed petitions as part of an Amnesty International campaign calling for his release. 
,  
February 10, 2015 – The last remaining charge was dropped against torture survivor Claudia Medina Tamariz. Over 300,000 people signed petitions as part of an Amnesty Internatioanl campaign calling for charges against her to be dropped. 
,  
,  
May 21, 2014 – Moroccan authorities reopen their investigation into the torture of Ali Aarrass and order a new medical examination, responding to calls from the UN Committee against Torture and Amnesty International. The examination was carried out in November 2014 over several days, without the presence an independent monitor. Ali Aarrass and his lawyers are yet to see the new report. 
,  
May 29, 2014 – Morocco’s Ministry of Justice and Liberties instructs prosecutors and judges to order medical examinations when faced with reports of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International has warned that despite existing safeguards, courts often fail to act when confronted with signs of torture. 
,  
,  
December 10, 2014 – Nigerian police publish a Human Rights Practice Manual setting out standards expected of police officers. Amnesty International has campaigned since 2008 for the police to produce detailed guidelines on respecting human rights for officers. 
,  
June 3, 2015 – Nigeria’s National Assembly passes a new bill criminalizing torture, as called for by an Amnesty International report. It is now awaiting signature by the newly-elected President Buhari. 
,  
June 3, 2015 – Nigeria frees Moses Akatugba, a Nigerian torture victim sentenced to death for armed robbery after stealing three mobile phones – a crime he says he didn’t commit –based on a “confession” obtained under torture. More than 800,000 Amnesty International supporters called on Delta State Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan to commute the death sentence through letters and petitions. The Governor pardoned Moses on May 28, 2015 as one of his last acts before leaving office.

After 10 years in jail, and over 800,000 messages from activists around the world, Moses’ life has been spared. Here, we speak to Justine Ijeomah, Director of the Human Rights, Social Development and Environmental Foundation (HURSDEF) in Nigeria and long-time ally in the campaign for Moses’ freedom. He describes Moses’ journey from schoolboy to death row inmate, and how the 26-year-old torture survivor reacted when he found out his life had been spared. 
,  
,  
These were among the first words Moses uttered when Justine called him to break the news that Emmanuel Uduaghan, Governor of Nigeria’s Delta State, had issued him a last-minute pardon on May 28, 2015. Justine had spent the day anxiously monitoring the Governor’s Facebook page, hoping for updates. “That day, I was so tense: I knew it was the last day the Governor could pardon Moses before he left office” he explains. “Finally, the good news came. I called Moses immediately and when I told him what had happened, he was overwhelmed with joy: he could not talk. It was a long time before he could respond, and then he just began to shout.” 
,  
,  
Aged 16, Moses was a normal schoolboy from southern Nigeria. Full of hope for the future, he was relieved to have finished his secondary school exams and was waiting anxiously for his results. His dream was to fulfil his late father’s wishes and study medicine. 
,  
On November 27, 2005, Moses said goodbye to his family and left to visit his aunt. When he didn’t come home as planned, his mother became worried. A widow, she was supporting her five children by selling food at a local market in Effurun, a busy city in Delta state. 
,  
While his mother was looking for him, Moses was being interrogated by soldiers. If Moses had been allowed to call a lawyer – or even just his mother – it could have protected him from torture. But for the first 24 hours, nobody knew where he was. 
,  
A local street vendor eventually visited Moses’ mother, saying she had seen a group of soldiers arrest him. Moses wasn’t to come home for almost ten years. 
,  
,  
It would be almost eight of those years before Justine was even to find out about Moses’ case. But as soon as he did, he went to Warri prison and interviewed him. “My organization [the Human Rights, Social Development and Environmental Foundation] in Nigeria documents cases of juveniles in prison with adults, so when I heard about Moses’ case it caught my attention” Justine explains. 
,  
There, Moses told Justine that when he was first arrested soldiers had shot him in one hand, beat him on the head and back, and taken him to a local army barracks for interrogation. They showed him a corpse and asked him to identify it. 
,  
“When Moses said he didn’t know the dead man, the soldiers beat him again.” Justine remembers. “They then took him to a police station, where he says the officers beat him hard with machetes and batons. They tied him up and left him hanging upside down from a ceiling fan for hours. They also pulled out his toe and finger nails with pliers. 
,  
“The pain I went through was unimaginable. In my whole life, I have never been subjected to such inhuman treatment,” said Moses. 
,  
The police suspected Moses of stealing three phones, some money and vouchers in an armed robbery. He has always denied these charges. But the officers tortured him and forced him to sign two pre-written “confessions,” which were later used as evidence during his trial. 
,  
,  
After eight years in prison, on November 12, 2013, Moses was sentenced to death by hanging. The conviction was based on his “confession” and the alleged robbery victim’s testimony. The police officer who investigated his case didn’t turn up in court. 
,  
Because Moses was a child when he was arrested, he should never have been sentenced to death. It is illegal under international law. Also, any “confession” obtained after torture should not be allowed as evidence in court. 
,  
,  
It was around this time that Justine approached Amnesty to join the campaign. “I began to travel to many different countries, telling Amnesty members Moses’ story and encouraging them to join the campaign” Justine explains. “I was so impressed by the level of commitment they had, especially the youth activists, who would go and demonstrate at the Nigerian embassies. I said to myself, if these children are this passionate about Moses, I should also go the extra mile.  And so I started to lobby all of the agencies that could release him.” 
,  
“I was so impressed by the commitment of the youth activists who would go and demonstrate at the Nigerian embassies. I said to myself, if these children are this passionate about Moses, I should also go the extra mile,” said Justine. 
,  
“We also took the campaign to Moses’ prison, and shared materials from Amnesty’s Stop Torture campaign with the death row inmates. After that visit, many death row inmates spoke out about torture. It was horrifying to hear their stories; many of them only confessed because they were tortured.” 
,  
,  
Moses has spent much of the last ten years isolated and traumatized. After he was transferred to a new prison in 2006, he was only able to see his family twice a month. “I never thought I’d be alive until today,” he told us only recently. 
,  
He thought his dream of becoming a doctor had been destroyed. Not long ago he told us that what pained him most is that while he’s been in prison, many of his former classmates have gone to university and found good jobs. 
,  
“On May 28, 2015, I was so tense. I knew it was the last day the Governor could pardon Moses before he left office,” said Justine. 
,  
But it all changed in the last few weeks, as local activists worked hard on the ground and thousands of Amnesty members sent tweets, messages, Facebook posts and signatures to Governor Uduaghan – in his last weeks in office.  “We really lobbied the authorities for Moses” Justine explains. “I sent text messages to those involved; spoke to them; I called the Governor five times, but he did not pick up the phone. But finally, the good news came.” 
,  
Today, after nearly ten years in prison, Moses is finally free. He can finally return home to begin his life again, perhaps as a doctor, and certainly as a human rights activist.

Today, after nearly ten years in prison, Moses is finally free. He can finally return home to begin his life again, perhaps as a doctor, and certainly as a human rights activist.

In May 2014, the RCMP released a national survey of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Although there were critical gaps in the data, that report marked the first national report of its kind, and included data from the RCMP and other police services across the country. 
,  
However, the RCMP update report issued today only included new records for cases within its own jurisdiction. The report states that, “The RCMP does not collect and report homicide data for the over 300 non-RCMP police agencies who each gave individual consent to use their data for the 2014 Overview.” This means, for example, that the new update excludes murders of Indigenous women and girls in all of Ontario and Quebec. 
,  
When it released its 2014 report, the RCMP said it had worked with police services across Canada to establish the Indigenous identity of missing and murdered women. Given the acknowledged importance of comprehensive and accurate reporting to understand and address violence against women, it is nothing less than shocking that the RCMP has not continued to collaborate with other police services to maintain and make public up-to-date records that are truly national. 
,  
,  
Throughout the report, the RCMP repeatedly emphasizes that violence within the family “is a key factor” in violence against all women. This is undoubtedly true, and the importance of effective strategies and adequate resources to address domestic violence cannot be overstated. At the same time, violence within the family is far from the only factor putting the lives of Indigenous women and girls at risk. 
,  
The 2014 RCMP report found that spouses, family members and other intimates were responsible for 62% of murders of Indigenous women in Canada. As is the case for all other women in Canada, domestic violence may account for the majority of violence. But it doesn’t account for all the violence. Crucially, 38% of Indigenous women and girls who have been murdered were not killed by spouses or family members. Their lives matter too, and ongoing attention and concerted action is needed to prevent murders that occur outside the family environment. 
,  
The 2014 report found that almost all offenders in these cases were known to their victims. So who are these offenders? It should be noted that the definition of “known” is broad and extends to a broad category called acquaintances, which includes colleagues, neighbours, and authority figures. 
,  
,  
The RCMP had an opportunity with the report released today to rectify the shortcomings of the 2014 report—many of which the RCMP itself acknowledged. Its failure to strengthen its reporting is disappointing, and many of Amnesty International’s concerns articulated a year ago remain:

,  
,  
,  
,  
And the result of such incomplete reporting? The true extent of the violence faced by Indigenous women and girls remains unknown because of the RCMP’s incomplete dataset, and because of inconsistencies and inaccuracies in police recording of Indigenous identity. 
,  
,  
Both the 2014 and 2015 RCMP reports cover missing the murdered Indigenous women in areas under RCMP jurisdiction. While Indigenous women and girls go missing and are murdered at far higher rates than other women and girls in Canada, they also experience other forms of violence at disproportionate levels. Indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to experience violence than other women and girls in Canada. Attention needs to be paid not only to those who have gone missing or been murdered, but to the living, who continue to experience violence.

,  
I would have never imagined that the petition created by our “small but mighty” Social Action Committee from Massey-Vanier High School would have such impact. It was amazing to have the opportunity to actually hand it over to Mexico’s Ambassador in Ottawa, see his reaction, and hear him say that he would ensure it reached the office of President Peña Nieto in Mexico. 
,  
Our petition spoke out about 43 students from a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa, Mexico who “disappeared” after they were attacked by police and gunmen.  We chose to take action around this because it is something that the students of our school can identify with and connect to. 
,  
Our initial goal was to make as many students in our school as possible aware about what happened.  For this reason, we wrote out a summary of the facts on a ten-foot long piece of paper, along with our appeal for action to find the missing students and bring those responsible for this crime to justice. 
,  
Then we asked everyone to express their concern by signing their name with a different colour marker. When we had the eye-catching signatures of more than 300 people, we sent our petition to Kathy Price, Amnesty International Canada’s Mexico campaigner. We were thrilled when she phoned to invite us to a meeting she had obtained with Mexico’s Ambassador in Ottawa so that we could personally present our petition. We accepted without any hesitation! 
,  
Before the meeting with Ambassador Suárez Dávila, Kathy introduced us to Hilda Legideño Vargas, whose son Jorge Antonio is one of the 43 disappeared students. Hilda was in Canada as part of the Ayotzinapa to Ottawa Caravan that was supported by Amnesty International. 
,  
Seeing how appreciative Hilda was of what we had done in our school was so empowering. It was also empowering to see that she refused to give up hope despite all of her sadness and fear about what is happening to those who speak up for human rights in Mexico. It makes me reflect about my life and how lucky I am to live in a safe environment. 
,  
When we met with Ambassador Suárez Dávila and all his staff at the Mexican Embassy in Ottawa, I had the opportunity to hand over our petition and explain to him about the concern of everyone at our school. Our petition was not the only one he received. Kathy presented the Ambassador with two huge boxes filled with other petitions, photo messages, a large banner created by students in Toronto, a video message and masses of handwritten letters wrapped around pencils. Kathy read out some of the messages that were sent by people in different parts of Canada. The Ambassador told us he was impressed by the outpouring of concern from across the country – and would share it with his government. 
,  
It came to me that none of us necessarily personally know the missing student-teachers, or the classmates and families affected by their disappearance. However, we all feel for them. Without knowing who they are individually, we are all working towards truth and justice, and towards peace in their hearts. People from all over Canada are coming together to show how much they care, and to tell the Mexican government that they are watching. 
,  
	Hearing from the mother of one of the disappeared students, presenting our petition to Mexico’s Ambassador, and seeing the impact of all the other messages of concern proved to me that even the smallest actions by any one of us can make a difference. When one person uses his or her voice, others will become interested, get in the know and will do the same. It is a domino effect. A negative situation can instill positivity across the globe, and through it all, people will join together to make a change. 
,  
This is what inspires me to do more. I hope it will inspire others.

Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has once again refused to make any meaningful commitment to address the ongoing social and health crisis caused by mercury contamination at the Grassy Narrows First Nation. 
,  
A new report released this week summarizes evidence that in some parts of the river system mercury contamination in top predator fish is two to 15 times higher than guidelines for safe consumption. 
,  
The report also found that rather than declining, the mercury contamination in the river system appears to be stabilizing at dangerously higher levels – and in some areas may actually be increasing. 
,  
Responding to the report this week, the Premier said the government needs more information before it can make any commitments. 
,  
Consider, however, some of what the government already knows: 
,  
Mercury is one of the most dangerous contaminants than can be released into the environment. Mercury accumulates in food chain and in the human body. It is known to cause a wide range of debilitating and potentially fatal health problems, including neurological degeneration, loss of motor control, heart disease and blindness. Mercury can pass into the fetus leading to chronic neurological and development problems for infants and children.

,  
Ontario’s double-standard 
,  
The Premier’s insistence that the province needs more information before making any commitments to cleaning up the river system not only flies in the face of all the evidence pointing to an urgent need for action, it also contrasts sharply with claims the Province has made about mercury and the Grassy Narrows environment in another context. 
,  
The people of Grassy Narrows have asked the province to carry out an environmental assessment of its plans to resume large-scale clearcut logging in their traditional territory. In particular, Grassy Narrows wants the opportunity for public review of the risk that clearcutting could introduce even more mercury into the river system through run off from exposed and disturbed soil. 
,  
Yet, despite similar concerns flagged by some of the government’s own scientists, the province has refused to conduct an environmental assessment. In this instance, the province claims that it already knows enough about mercury and the natural environment to be confident that it is properly managing the risks even though none of its mitigation measures have ever been scientifically tested.  
,  
Justice denied 
,  
Overall, the province’s record on Grassy Narrows has been one of refusal to make any commitments, other than to a business as usual approach to clearcut logging. The province has never acknowledged the right of the people of Grassy Narrows to say ‘no’ to unwanted forms of development that they feel risk further harm to their health and economy. The province has refused to honour the community’s call for a moratorium on clearcutting. And the province has made no commitments to clean up the mercury which still poisons Grassy Narrows’ waters and people.  
,  
Responding to the latest report, the Premier would only say that the province would continue to meet with the people of Grassy Narrows to discuss their concerns. 
,  
It’s important to send a clear message to the provincial government that the people of Grassy Narrows need more than just talk: they need a clear, concrete and principled commitments to action, including a clean-up of the river system, provision of comprehensive community health care including appropriate care for those suffering from mercury poisoning, and respect for their right to determine how their lands and environment will be used and protected into the future.

His birth however had never been registered, and his birth country did not recognize him as a citizen. 
, 	   
, 	Abdi told me after arriving in Canada he developed some addictions and did stupid things that he was not proud of.  As a result of his activities related to his addictions, he was convicted and sentenced to an 8 month prison term. Upon completion of his prison sentence he remained in detention on an immigration hold. In spite of being stateless, when Abdi first called me, he had been on an immigration hold for more than two years as Canadian authorities attempted to remove him to his country of birth.  It was impossible to remove him to his birth country as there was no record that he had been born there.  Abdi told me he was ‘going crazy in here.’  After more than two years on an immigration hold he had lost faith in Canadian ‘justice.’  In his view the law and the courts had let him down and he had nowhere to turn to help.  
,  
Abdi spoke of despair and anxiety due to his immigration status.  His detention seemed to be indefinite and he had no idea when or if he would ever be released. While there were monthly reviews of his detention, he often did not have a lawyer to represent him, and in spite of being stateless there were ongoing efforts to remove him from Canada.  I accepted his collect calls from the detention centre; made sure he had access to a lawyer and tried to provide some support and hope. 
,  
A new report by the International Human Rights Program from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Law, We Have No Rights, provides an alarming overview of the scope of Immigration detention in Canada which affects thousands of non-citizens every year – including those with mental health issues, torture victims, pregnant women, and children.   The report focuses on the mental health concerns of migrants who are held in provincial jails and finds that immigration detention has a catastrophic impact on mental health – making existing mental health issues worse, and creating new ones. 
, 	The report finds there are shocking gaps in the rule of law related to immigration detention and makes important recommendations including the need for an independent body/ombudsperson who should be responsible for overseeing and investigating the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA), and to whom immigration detainees like Abdi can turn to in order to register complaints and request investigations.  The report also recommends that Canada create a rule which favours release after 90 days of detention for individuals on an immigration hold. This is an important recommendation.  While Abdi had been held for ONLY two years, the report cites a case of an immigration detainee in Canada who has been held for 8 years!  Throughout this time little has been done to seriously explore less expensive and less restrictive alternatives to detention. 
,  
The report concludes that the detention of migrants with mental health issues in provincial jails violates the human rights of some of the most vulnerable people in Canadian society.  Immigration detention is often arbitrary, and in some cases amounts to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment which provides no effective remedy for those detained. 
,  
This report gives a voice to people like Abdi and the thousands of others detained in Canada for immigration purposes who find themselves in something approaching a legal “black hole”.  Abdi doesn’t need a report to tell him that his detention was unjust, and he can only hope that Canadian authorities will adhere to their international human rights obligations and put an end to the indefinite and arbitrary detention of non-citizens in Canada.

All of this attention is encouraging, but the reasons why have shocked me to my core. 
 
Raif was arrested in our country Saudi Arabia three years ago today just because he expressed his ideas – he took to his keyboard and started his own website. 
He is a person who loves life and adores freedom, and for this he has received the harshest of sentences. He has been locked up since 2012, serving a 10-year prison sentence, and he has already suffered 50 lashes in public out of an unspeakably cruel 1,000 lashes – too much for any person to bear. 
Since Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court recently upheld his sentence, with no room for appeal, Raif still has the threat of 19 more flogging sessions hanging over him, despite his poor health. All of this because he expressed himself. 
After we got married in 2002, our life together was beautiful, careless and free, up until he decided to launch his first Saudi Liberals website several years later. 
Ever since then, I have always feared for Raif’s safety, for I know quite well that the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia is mighty, fierce and wanton. These fears were realised in 2007, when Raif was officially summoned for the first time by the State Security, and life soon turned harsh for us. Things got increasingly worse after his arrest in 2012 and then his drastic sentence was handed down last year. 
With the utmost regret, I have to say that the harsh and inhumane sentence issued against Raif last year was meant to send a clear message to all those who might dare stand up against Saudi Arabia’s religious hard-liners; it came as a shock that I still cannot recover from – it has become a sheer inferno of unbearable torture. 
Raif has always meant everything to me and the kids; he is a father of three angels and a great husband. I can never describe how much we miss him. We have lost almost everything since his imprisonment. 
The first day Raif was sent to prison I decided that I had two choices: to be weak, give up and hide in a corner weeping, or to stay strong and fight for Raif’s freedom. I am the kind of person who always has high hopes, despite the obstacles. 
I have been through rough days but my first days in Canada were even rougher; a new language, new people and a new life. I’ve had to bear all of this on top of my thoughts about the long distance between Raif and me, and that I cannot go back to Saudi Arabia. However, in Québéc I have found genuine people who made me wish that Raif and I had moved to live here a long time ago. 
My life in Canada can be described as perfect and great; the way the Quebecois people treat us is more than superb. The government of Quebec and the political opposition have been very supportive; they are all magnificent. The only thing I miss here is having Raif with us. 
Far beyond Canada, people around the world have been very supportive of me and Raif – in particular due to the efforts of Amnesty International activists, who spared no campaign or activity to help us. All the phrases of the world will not be enough to express my thanks to them for all their efforts to free Raif. They recently organised an excellent tour to bring me and my message to several European countries, where I met with political leaders. The European leaders welcomed me as if I were a politician or diplomat, and such treatment alone prompted me to be optimistic and full of hope. Everyone is trying, and hopefully these efforts will one day bear fruits. 
I have pleaded and would like to reiterate my plea to His Majesty King Salman, Saudi Arabia’s ruler, to pardon Raif and stop his flogging. It is true that I have received no reply but I remain optimistic and will continue pleading until the last moment. 
Amnesty International supporters around the world have campaigned alongside Ensaf Haidar and continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi and all other prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia.

,  
Today, like many people around the world, I waited to find out if Raif Badawi would again be hauled out of his prison cell and mercilessly lashed another 50 times in a public square in Jeddah. 
,  
The same suspense has gripped people for 23 weeks since the first time this act of cruelty was inflicted on the imprisoned blogger on 9 January this year. That day, a crowd of onlookers gathered in the square immediately after Friday prayers to witness this hateful spectacle. 
,  
While flogging and other cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments are commonplace in Saudi Arabia, they are not necessarily carried out on Fridays and in public. There is often an air of secrecy even around the many beheadings and other executions in the country – which have seen a macabre spike since the beginning of this year. 
,  
Amnesty International has campaigned for Raif’s release since his arrest in 2012. Since he was flogged, it joined more than a million activists, journalists and political leaders in calling for an end to the horror and for his immediate release. 
,  
But all these pleas have fallen on deaf ears. In fact, they have prompted even more defiance from the Kingdom’s rulers. 
,  
Such public defiance was evident again yesterday, when an anonymous official in Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry rebuffed international “interference” in the kingdom’s judiciary and nonchalantly dismissed the international outcry that Raif could be flogged on grounds that no official statement was issued by the Court or by the authorities. 
,  
It is surreal for an unnamed ministry source to decry international concern over a sentence that is such a flagrant violation of international law. Could the authorities actually think that these kinds of punishment are such an everyday occurrence that they do not warrant protests for human dignity? 
,  
Likewise, the Supreme Court leaking its decision to a state-controlled newspaper late at night and allowing them to again degrade Raif, says something about the type of justice and human dignity the authorities espouse. 
,  
	The Supreme Court should have endeavoured to provide Raif and his lawyers with a copy of its judgment. Of course, his main lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, is himself serving a prison sentence as the first human rights lawyer to be convicted under a draconian 2014 counter-terrorism law, clearly invoked in his case to hinder his work. 
,  
Perhaps the authorities think that their allies in the West would not bat an eyelid at them treating a human rights defender such as Waleed Abu al-Khair like a member of the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS). 
,  
But who knows? 
,  
The authorities seem to forget that Raif’s case had mysteriously reached the Supreme Court in December 2014, after neither Waleed nor Raif could appeal the earlier decision. It turns out the case was sent by someone within the Royal Court, not to be confused with a court of law, which is practically the office of the King himself. 
,  
Such secrecy and stealth is not limited to Raif Badawi’s case. 
,  
In fact, Saudi Arabia’s authorities seem to think that it is fine to ban lawyers from discussing their clients’ cases. They force lawyers to sign pledges not to share court documents with anyone, while at the same time feeding state-controlled media a one-sided view of developments. 
,  
	This is blunt hypocrisy. Saudi Arabia’s judiciary is not independent from the executive in law, a fact that is clearly evident from its role in the incessant and systematic persecution of the country’s independent human rights activists and peaceful dissidents. Like Waleed Abu al-Khair, many are now confined to a prison cell just for defending the human rights of their compatriots. 
,  
Take the case of Suliaman al-Rashudi, an 80-year-old former judge arrested in December 2012, two days after he gave a private talk about the legality of peaceful protests in Shari’a law. He was taken without an arrest warrant to serve a 15-year sentence that he did not know was upheld by an appeal court. For someone his age, it was tantamount to a death sentence. 
,  
He is not alone. Ten other founding members of al-Rashudi’s human rights group, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), have been dragged one by one to jails around the country after grossly unfair trials and sentences harsher than those handed down to Saudi fighters who join IS. 
,  
So let’s cut the nonsense. The Saudi Arabian judiciary is not independent. The same King heads the various branches of government, and he rules by decree. And no one takes seriously the reckless off-handed remarks of unnamed formal sources. 
,  
What threatens judicial independence isn’t international criticism – it’s the law of the land and the interference of the executive that has made a mockery of this fundamental bulwark of rule of law and human rights. Who knows what kind of threats to their lives and livelihood other decent judges like Suliaman al-Rashudi faced when they tried to uphold their independence? 
,  
	Fundamental reforms are needed to tackle the gross shortcomings of Saudi justice. But Raif Badawi and other prisoners of conscience must not be left to languish behind bars waiting for such reforms. We are urging King Salman to do the right thing and ensure Raif Badawi is freed immediately and unconditionally. The holy month of Ramadan which is about to begin has traditionally been an occasion for the authorities to release prisoners. Accordingly, the King should seize the moment and free Raif Badawi, lift the threat of further lashes and allow him to be reunited with his family, who have also suffered every brutal step of his unfair trial and punishment.

The statement affirms something that is now well-established –and which was, in fact, acknowledged in Canada’s official apology to residential school survivors. 
Quite simply, the residential school policy had at its heart an insidious agenda to eradicate First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples as distinct cultures, societies and nation. And the tragic effects of the harm that was done —  including the terrible deprivations and abuses inflicted on so many of the girls and boys who were torn from their families and communities to attend these schools, as well as the loss of language, community cohesion and cultural knowledge and skills — continue to be felt today. 
Responding to the report, Amnesty International Secretary General Alex Neve pointed out that reconciliation and justice and inseparable and that justice has three fundamental elements: acknowledging the truth, setting things right, and ensuring that the harm is never repeated. 
In thinking about this, and about our role as Canadians is advancing the cause of justice and reconciliation, it’s worth noting just  how many of the Commission’s 94 recommendations deal with current government programmes and policies. 
These recommendations include, for example, closing the gap in funding for on-reserve First Nations education, and measures to address the continued removal of Indigenous children by the child welfare system. 
The fact is that instead of making a concerted effort to help Indigenous peoples recover from the harms inflicted by the residential schools and other destructive government policies, the federal government is today systematically underfunding basic services in Indigenous communities relative to what is available in non-Indigenous communities, relative to the higher costs of delivering such services in small or remote communities, and relative to the real and pressing needs of Indigenous peoples. 
The effect is continue deny far too many of today’s generation of Indigenous youth a fair opportunity to have healthy, safe childhoods, to grow up in their own cultures and language,s and to realize their full potential  according to their own values and aspirations. 
Take the example of child and family services. 
A case currently before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has brought to light a vast body of evidence demonstrating that persistent underfunding of services on reserve has meant that the removal of children from their families – something that is supposed to be a last resort– has all too often become instead the only option available to overburdened family services agencies that don’t have the money or resources needed to provide the support that First Nations families really need in times of crisis. The result: more First Nations children being taken from their families, communities and cultures than at the height of the residential school programme. 
This devastating underfunding of children’s services may not have an explicit objective of destroying Indigenous societies, but it does at the very least demonstrate a shocking indifference to the further harm being inflicted on individuals, families and nations. 
“Reconciliation is about not having to say sorry a second time.” These are the words of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, whose organization, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, has lead the effort to have the issue addressed at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. Describing that case in an interview with Amnesty International, she said, “I don’t want to see another generation of First Nations adults having to recover from their childhoods as so many survivors of the residential schools have had to do.” 
This week, the Child and Family Caring Society is marking the anniversary of Canada’s official apology to residential schools survivors with a call to action.  Our Dreams Matter Too is a banner for all kinds of activities, including walks, vigils and letter-writing, with a simple, common message: First Nations children and youth deserve chance to grow up safely at home, get a good education, be healthy, and be proud of their cultures. 
This year marks the fourth annual Our Dreams Matter Too action. Amnesty International is proud to be part of this important and vitally necessary event. 
This year’s event is even more timely and urgent, both because of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and because of a finding just released from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal that concluded that the federal government has taken retaliatory actions against Cindy Blackstock for her role in the launching the discrimination complaint. 
In its summary report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission made it clear that we all have a part to play in putting the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous on a path of justice and respect for human rights. The Commission wrote, “Canadians must do more than just talk about reconciliation; we must learn how to practise reconciliation in our everyday lives—within ourselves and our families, and in our communities, governments, places of worship, schools, and workplaces.” 
Or as Cindy Blackstock said to Amnesty members, “We really do need all of your help and your support as we move forward to build not only a more just world for First Nations kids, but to build a better future for Canada in the process.”

We’ve since learned that the USA’s National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have been monitoring the internet and phone activity of hundreds of millions of people across the world. Two years on, we take a look at how the landscape has changed thanks to the documents Snowden released. (Read the full report – Edward Snowden, two years on.) 
1. We know A LOT more about what governments are doing. 
For example, we know that companies including Facebook, Google and Microsoft were forced to handover customer data under secret orders from the NSA. And that the NSA recorded, stored and analysed ‘metadata’ relating to every single telephone call and text message transmitted in Mexico, Kenya and the Philippines. 
2. There has been huge public opposition to government mass surveillance. 
In our poll of 13 countries across every continent, we found that 71% of people are strongly opposed to their governments spying on the internet and phone activity. More than 450 organisations and experts across the world have signed up to ‘necessary and proportionate’ principles on how to apply human rights to communications surveillance. And more than 80,000 people have already signed Amnesty’s global petition to ban mass surveillance. 
3. Judges have ruled aspects of these programs to be illegal. 
In the UK, the legal body that oversees the secret services declared aspects of the sharing of intercepted communications between the USA and the UK to have been unlawful before December 2014. And in the USA, a court of appeal ruled in May 2015 that the bulk collection of US phone records was illegal. 
4. Technology companies and software engineers are building privacy into software. 
Several major companies including Apple, Google and Whatsapp have improved the default security and encryption provided to users. Greater consumer pressure has pushed the industry to strengthen its approach to protecting users’ privacy. 
5. Global experts are speaking out against the status quo. 
A number of international bodies have warned that mass surveillance poses a threat to our human rights. The UN expert on counter-terrorism and human rights said: “The hard truth is that the use of mass surveillance technology effectively does away with the right to privacy of communications on the internet altogether.” What’s more, after overlooking privacy issues for decades, the UN created a new privacy watchdog, or ‘Special Rapporteur’. This expert will focus on privacy issues both online and offline, including surveillance. 
6. Companies are standing up to governments. 
For example, ten of the world’s largest tech companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, have launched a campaign calling for an end to the bulk collection of personal data. 
7. There is increased scrutiny of the laws underpinning mass surveillance. 
In the UK, a government committee has called for an overhaul of the laws governing intelligence agencies, so that the whole process would be more transparent. Over in the USA, the House of Representatives passed the USA Freedom Act, which attempts to end government bulk collection of US phone records. 
But… governments have still done far too little to dismantle their mass surveillance programmes. Many aspects of US surveillance remain under-regulated and unaccountable – including the mass surveillance of millions of people outside of the US. The UK extended its powers in 2014 to retain people’s personal communications data and has further surveillance legislation on the horizon. This year has also seen sweeping new surveillance powers proposed in Pakistan, France and Switzerland, while in the Netherlands a new intelligence bill is expected imminently. 
Join the fight back 
The tide is turning against mass surveillance but our privacy and freedom are still at stake. We need to keep telling governments that our private lives are none of their business. Sign the petition and call on the USA and UK – as well as their close allies Australia, Canada and New Zealand – to ban mass surveillance today.

People are much more sceptical of surveillance programs than they were before I came forward. After looking through the information that has been revealed, people have broadly confirmed that our governments have been breaking the law. Even the courts, which have every incentive to say: ‘nothing to see here, move along’. To have been a part of that, and to now have the opportunity to restore, not just a measure of lawfulness to governments, but a measure of liberty to our digital lives, is something that gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning. 
,  
What have people in the intelligence community said? 
,  
There are a lot of political incentives for people involved in intelligence to say: ‘the disclosures are extraordinarily damaging’. But in private a lot of them are very concerned about whether or not mass surveillance is right, and whether or not we should be doing it at all. 
,  
Officials also think that the public awareness of mass surveillance is actually beneficial to them. Because, if you reveal to the world that you’ve got the most incredible spy machine on the planet, every other spy wants to talk to you and trade baseball cards with you. I’ve seen a lot of that. 
,  
Any regrets? 
,  
I have one regret: I should have come forward sooner. Had I done so, I think we would have a much greater degree of liberty in our online lives. Because the biggest challenge we face in reforming these surveillance programs is that, once the money has been spent, and once the practices have been institutionalized in secret, without the public knowing, it’s very difficult to change them. 
,  
The government doesn’t want to just uproot these systems and throw them away. And spy chiefs have gotten used to the ability to go, ‘you know, we don’t even need to order surveillance on this person – we already have all of their private records because we spy on everybody. So let’s just look through the last 30 years of their phone calls, location records and border crossings’. It’s very difficult to convince them to give that up. 
,  
  
,  
What would you say to people who think ‘I’ve got nothing to hide, so mass surveillance doesn’t matter’? 
,  
It’s not about having nothing to hide, it’s about being you. It’s about being friends with who you want to be friends with, without worrying about what it looks like on paper or inside some private record in some dark government vault. 
,  
It’s about realising there’s a reason we close the bathroom door. There’s a reason we don’t want the police to have a video camera where they can watch us while we’re sitting in the bubble bath. There’s a reason everybody gets so concerned about the Samsung TV that’s recording what you say in your living room, and then sending it to third parties. This is what you’re going to get. You’re not going to watch TV any more. TV is going to watch you. 
,  
What do you think will happen now? 
,  
This is going to be one of the most impactful human rights issues of the next 30 years. Because what we’re seeing now is only the beginning. Everybody working on this stuff from the engineering side is thinking: How can we push this further? How do we collect more? Technology will get cheaper, connection easier and networks more pervasive, so that you’ll never be outside of a means of transmitting data. If we don’t get a handle on these things, and set real international standards about the kind of behaviour that is appropriate in a free and liberal society, what we’re going to find is that free and liberal societies will no longer exist. 
,  
And how have you been? 
,  
I have a lot less leisure time. It’s kinda funny. People probably think going underground is a slightly devil-may-care thing to do. But I actually work much more now than I ever did before. And I’m really fulfilled by that. I work seven days a week, generally. Because there’s so much to be done. 
,  
The hardest part of the last two years has been being away from my family and my home. I made a lot of sacrifices. I live more simply now, but ultimately it’s been worth it. And people have been extremely supportive – even people from the intelligence community. 
,  
Any last words? 
,  
Progress is the product of dissent. If nobody is willing to change things, or try something different, if nobody is willing to risk going outside the boundaries of what people normally do, we’ll have very static and I think very limited societies. 
,  
Join the fight back 
,  
The tide is turning against mass surveillance but our privacy and freedom are still at stake. We need to keep telling governments that our private lives are none of their business. Sign the petition and call on the USA and UK – as well as their close allies Australia, Canada and New Zealand – to ban mass surveillance today.

Check out the links below this interview for more information on mass surveillance two years after the Snowden reveelation and how you can take action. 
What do you think has changed over the last two years? 
People are much more sceptical of surveillance programs than they were before I came forward. After looking through the information that has been revealed, people have broadly confirmed that our governments have been breaking the law. Even the courts, which have every incentive to say: ‘nothing to see here, move along’.

Follow Christoph on Twittwr @ckoettl 
,  
With citizen journalism and the availability of new technologies growing exponentially, human rights investigators are able to locate and review evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity at a speed never before imagined. Amnesty International’s Christoph Koettl explains how it’s done. 
,  
In March 2014 a grainy cell phone video came across my desk that seemed to show a Nigerian soldier murdering an unarmed man in broad daylight. It took me a day and a half to pinpoint the location of this apparent war crime to a specific street corner in Maiduguri, the state capital of Borno and a city of more than 500,000 people. 
,  
Confirming the location of an incident is a crucial step in the authentication process, so finding this fact was highly relevant to reference the footage in a report we published on 31 March 2014, exposing war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Nigerian military and Boko Haram. 
,  
The report documented the killings carried out in January, February and March 2014 by both Boko Haram and the Nigerian Security Forces. It highlights 14 March as a tipping point when the security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown on former detainees. 
,  
On 14 March Boko Haram gunmen attacked the Giwa military barracks in Maiduguri, Borno state. They fought their way into the detention facilities and freed several hundred detainees. Amnesty International has received credible evidence that as the military regained control, more than 640 people, mostly unarmed recaptured detainees, were extrajudicially executed in various locations across Maiduguri. 
,  
Little did I know that this low-quality, 35-second clip was only the tip of the iceberg. Over the next 14 months, I reviewed close to 150 clips, painting a shocking picture of how both Nigerian armed forces and Boko Haram commit atrocities on an ongoing basis. It was at times a gut-wrenching process that without a doubt left its mark on myself and others involved in this work—I would be lying if I’d claim to be a cool investigator that remains unaffected by this grim – and often grisly – content. My hope, though, is that our findings will have a positive and lasting impact on the human rights situation in Nigeria. 
,  
The footage—stemming from eyewitnesses and likely perpetrators, captured mainly on cell phones and shared between individuals or on social media—played a crucial role in the research released in our new report today. However, the significance of the accompanying authentication efforts goes beyond Nigeria. 
,  
Citizen media is revolutionizing human rights fact-finding, opening up new possibilities for investigations by human rights watchdogs, and potentially also courts. In order to realize this potential, new methodologies and tools have to be developed. The extensive experience with the footage from Nigeria also allowed me to develop a simple framework for reviewing citizen media for human rights investigations, which I am confident will be replicable elsewhere. Here’s some insight into our work. 
,  
Authenticating amateur videos of atrocities 
, 	The videos we have found predominantly show human rights violations by Nigerian military forces and an associated civilian militia, the so-called Civilian Joint Task Force (Civilian JTF), that uses machetes and other crude weaponry to go after perceived Boko Haram supporters. In order to use the videos, we had to first carefully review and authenticate them—the risk of inaccuracies is enormous, as can be witnessed by regular blunders in reporting. While verifying citizen media often centres on confirming the date and location of an incident, in human rights fact-finding it is also important to interview eyewitnesses and identify specific violations and the responsible perpetrators. 
,  
Going back to the above-mentioned video, the poor quality of the footage made it unlikely to draw any conclusions about the location or date of the incident at first sight. However, a careful frame-by-frame review allowed me to identify characteristics such as a paved road, an elevated middle strip, T-shaped street lamps, and that the incident happened at an intersection. Poring over hours of satellite imagery on Google Earth allowed me to identify a likely location, which was later confirmed by a series of geo-tagged photographs of the same incident, highlighting the importance of both content analysis and metadata review in the authentication process. 
,  
	In the following weeks and months, more videos and photographs from March 14, 2014 emerged. The files included highly graphic footage of Nigerian soldiers cutting the throat of several men. In this case, our researchers were able to obtain the original video files, allowing me to extract metadata such as a timestamp, confirming the date of the incident. 
,  
Using citizen media in human rights investigations 
, 	My methodology centres on metadata analysis and content review, which proved highly successful in authenticating footage from Nigeria. Content analysis, which was done by reviewing the footage in slow motion, not only allowed me to identify specific geographic features, but also details such as inventory numbers of weaponry or military vehicles, which can be crucial evidence to identify specific units, and most importantly, command responsibility. 
,  
For example, details in the video of Nigerian soldiers cutting the throats of several men suggest that they belong to the Support Company of the 81 Battalion. Such findings might go beyond human rights fact-finding and have political or legal implications. The International Criminal Court is currently conducting a preliminary examination into the armed conflict in north east Nigeria. Additionally, national legislation, such as the Leahy Law in theUSA, prohibit military aid to foreign security forces that are implicated in serious violations of human rights. It is precisely these sort of details on unit involvement and command responsibility that have serious implications on the vetting process of the Leahy Law. 
,  
An analytic framework for authenticating citizen media should also include the preservation of footage, investigating the source, expert consultation if necessary (such as forensics experts), and ethical and risk considerations. If you watch Amnesty International’s video on Nigeria from last August, you’ll notice the anonymization of individuals – including the perpetrators – by blurring their faces. In the case of Nigeria, the verification process included corroboration of the events shown in the video by eyewitness testimony and other information from reliable sources on the ground, including a number of military officials. Due to the large amount of footage, some of the videos themselves provided a degree of authentication. For example, during a screening operation of hundreds of men, after which 35 were arrested and later executed by the military in the town of Bama in late July 2013, eyewitnesses were at one point filming each other. 
,  
It is important to highlight that all of the analysis was done with freely available tools such as MediaInfo, Google Earth Pro and VLC (a full list of tools can be found in Amnesty International’s Citizen Evidence Lab). 
,  
The international outcry over pictures and videos coming out of other inaccessible conflict zones has been enormous in the recent past. Let’s hope that this footage from Nigeria and our overall findings will have a similar effect, prompting urgent investigations into the many atrocities that have taken place across the north-east of the country. The surviving victims and their relatives have the right to see their abusers face justice.

Simple truths can change the world. 
Two years ago today, in a Hong Kong hotel room, three journalists and I waited nervously to see how the world would react to the revelation that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had been collecting records of millions of people around the world. 
Though we have come a long way, the right to privacy remains under attack.	Last month, the NSA’s invasive call-tracking program was declared unlawful by the US courts and it was disowned by Congress. And, after a White House investigation found that the program never stopped a single terrorist attack, even President Obama ordered it terminated. 
This is because of you. This is the power of an informed public around the world. 
Ending mass surveillance of private phone calls under the Patriot Act is a historic victory for the rights of US citizens. Yet while we have reformed this one program, many more remain in the US and other countries. 
We need to push back and challenge the lawmakers who defend these programs. We need to make it clear that a vote in favor of mass surveillance is a vote in favor of illegal and ineffective violations of the right to privacy for all. 
As I said at an Amnesty event in London this week, arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. 
We can’t take the right to privacy for granted, just like we can’t take the right to free speech for granted. We can’t let these invasions of our rights stand. 
While we worked away in that hotel room in Hong Kong, there were moments when we worried we might have put our lives at risk for nothing – that the public would react with apathy to the publication of evidence that revealed that democratic governments had been collecting and storing billions of intimate records of innocent people. 
Never have I been so grateful to have been so wrong.

On twitter @williamnee 
,  
26 years have passed since the tragic days in 1989 when thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters were brutally repressed in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. 
,  
But even though the tanks have long left the city’s infamous square, President Xi Jinping, appears as determined to quash anyone perceived as challenging the Communist Party’s hegemony. 
,  
 
,  
When President Xi took office in late 2012, he declared power would be put “in a cage”, but it is the independently minded academics, journalists, lawyers, and rights activists that have been thrown in jail. 
,  
We are witnessing one of the darkest periods for freedom of expression in China since the bloodshed of 1989. 
,  
Gao Yu, a veteran Chinese journalist currently languishing in a Beijing jail, is one of the many dissenting voices who has suffered the arbitrary power of the Chinese state for decades. In April, after an unfair trial, she was sentenced to seven years in prison on the spurious charge of “disclosing state secrets.”  She was first declared a “public enemy” by Communist Party officials in the late 1980s, when she was deputy editor-in-chief of pro-reform newspaper Economics Weekly. 
,  
In the spring of 1989, when hundreds of thousands of students and workers took to the streets in Beijing and across China, in one of the largest pro-democracy movements in history, Economics Weekly ran a series of articles urging the government to heed the protesters’ calls for reform.  
, 	The powers that be did not take kindly to such stories, and swiftly shut the paper down. Gao Yu was detained by police on 3 June 1989. 
, 	Later that evening, the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, were killed or injured as the army brutally quashed the pro-democracy protests. 
,  
Today, China’s leaders persist with playing politics with the past, attempting to whitewash the truth of the 4 June 1989 bloodshed. The authorities still prevent the relatives of those killed during the Tiananmen crackdown from grieving publicly. Parents’ calls for truth, compensation, and accountability fall on deaf ears. 
,  
Gao Yu, spent 15 months in prison following the Tiananmen crackdown. In the 1990s, she spent a further six years in jail, again after being convicted of disclosing “state secrets”. Then, like now, Amnesty declared her a prisoner of conscience and called for her immediate and unconditional release. 
, 	The authorities fear the power of her pen. She is repeatedly punished for her commitment to report the facts and disclose the truth. 
,

26 years have passed since the tragic days in 1989 when thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters were brutally repressed in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. 
But even though the tanks have long left the city’s infamous square, President Xi Jinping, appears as determined to quash anyone perceived as challenging the Communist Party’s hegemony. 
 
When President Xi took office in late 2012, he declared power would be put “in a cage”, but it is the independently minded academics, journalists, lawyers, and rights activists that have been thrown in jail. 
We are witnessing one of the darkest periods for freedom of expression in China since the bloodshed of 1989. 
Gao Yu, a veteran Chinese journalist currently languishing in a Beijing jail, is one of the many dissenting voices who has suffered the arbitrary power of the Chinese state for decades. In April, after an unfair trial, she was sentenced to seven years in prison on the spurious charge of “disclosing state secrets.”  She was first declared a “public enemy” by Communist Party officials in the late 1980s, when she was deputy editor-in-chief of pro-reform newspaper Economics Weekly. 
In the spring of 1989, when hundreds of thousands of students and workers took to the streets in Beijing and across China, in one of the largest pro-democracy movements in history, Economics Weekly ran a series of articles urging the government to heed the protesters’ calls for reform. 	The powers that be did not take kindly to such stories, and swiftly shut the paper down. Gao Yu was detained by police on 3 June 1989.	Later that evening, the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, were killed or injured as the army brutally quashed the pro-democracy protests. 
Today, China’s leaders persist with playing politics with the past, attempting to whitewash the truth of the 4 June 1989 bloodshed. The authorities still prevent the relatives of those killed during the Tiananmen crackdown from grieving publicly. Parents’ calls for truth, compensation, and accountability fall on deaf ears. 
Gao Yu, spent 15 months in prison following the Tiananmen crackdown. In the 1990s, she spent a further six years in jail, again after being convicted of disclosing “state secrets”. Then, like now, Amnesty declared her a prisoner of conscience and called for her immediate and unconditional release.	The authorities fear the power of her pen. She is repeatedly punished for her commitment to report the facts and disclose the truth. 
This time, Gao Yu is accused of leaking an internal Communist Party ideological paper, known as Document No. 9, a charge she vehemently denies.	Freedom of the press and “universal values”, such as democracy and human rights, come under severe attack in Document No. 9.

The Truth and...,"Full implementation of the recommendations released today by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission is essential to provide justice for residential schools survivors and their communities and to ensure that Canada lives up to its international human rights obligations. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established as part of a legal settlement with survivors of the government-funded and church-run Indian Residential Schools. For over a century, more than 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children were forcibly taken from their families and communities to attend these schools. The Commission estimates than more than 6,000 children died in these schools while countless others endured hardship, deprivation and abuse. 
The Commission has concluded that the residential schools were “part of a coherent policy to eliminate Aboriginal people as distinct peoples and to assimilate them into the Canadian mainstream against their will.” A summary of the Commission’s findings released today states, “The Canadian government pursued this policy of cultural genocide because it wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources.” 
In a process launched six years ago, the Truth and Reconciliation heard more than 1,300 hours of testimony and received almost 7,000 statements from witnesses. The Commission released its recommendations today, with a full report to follow later this year. 
The Commission’s 94 recommendations include: 
Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, said, “When grave human rights abuses are committed, international law requires not only an acknowledgement and apology, but also effective measures to set things right and to ensure that the harms are never repeated. Implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a necessary and vital contribution to the cause of justice. Critically, though, as the Commission said, we all have a part to play in ensuring that true reconciliation happens.” 
Béatrice Vaugrante, Directrice générale Amnistie internationale Canada, said, “Shocking crimes were committed against the 150,000 children taken away to residential schools, and against the families, communities and nations that were the targets of this forced assimilation scheme. Justice in the fullest sense must not be denied any longer because what happened then still has consequences today.”

	For four years, the Sudanese military has waged a terrifying war against its own people, in the besieged state of South Kordofan. As the fourth anniversary of this disgraceful human rights crisis approaches next month; it is long past time for the world to finally do something about it. 
I have just wrapped up an Amnesty International mission that has been able to cross into the remote Nuba Mountain areas of South Kordofan that are controlled by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army – North opposition. 
The SPLA-N is fighting for greater autonomy for the state. The Sudanese military have responded by cutting opposition controlled areas off from outside access and launching an unrelenting campaign of indiscriminate aerial bombardment and ground shelling that has killed, maimed, starved, terrorized and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. 
Wherever we went, there was an attack to document.	  
 
	Nowhere near legitimate military targets, we recorded the devastating impact on civilians — from the very young to the very old – of bombs pushed out of lumbering Antonovs, missiles unleashed from streaking MiG and Sokhoi fighters and long-range rockets fired by distant ground forces. 
Heading into remote villages and sites where internally displaced people have fled for safety we found unexploded rockets, cluster munitions, bomb craters, shrapnel fragments and destroyed or damaged property everywhere. And everywhere means hospital grounds, medical clinics, roofs of primary schools, family shelters, mills for grinding sorghum, adjacent to secondary schools, food stores and fields, the middle of a football pitch and the compounds of local relief agencies. Antonov bombs even fell on a prisoner of war camp last month, killing two captured Sudanese soldiers and injuring four others. 
Close to 100,000 people have fled across the border into South Sudan — itself wracked by civil war for the past 18 months. Hundreds of thousands more remain trapped and displaced within either the military or opposition controlled areas of South Kordofan. And with a humanitarian blockade enforced by the Sudanese government in Khartoum, that means food relief, essential medicines and school resources are not getting through. 
  
 
After four years it was not at all surprising, but still heartbreaking, to see how the violence has struck individuals, families and communities, not once, but repeatedly. 
Alfadil, a teacher living in an IDP site, told us of the death in February of his wife, Nahid, who was eight months pregnant at the time. She heard the ominous droning of an Antonov and ran to ensure children in the vicinity — including her own young son — made it to safety. 
 
	Nahid was struck down by shrapnel and killed immediately. But her baby was still alive. With only one surgical hospital still operating (days away by foot), and other hospitals and clinics closed or scaled back after being bombed, sometimes repeatedly, there was nowhere to turn for medical attention to save the baby’s life. 
Two months later the Antonovs returned. Alfadil’s two-year-old son was hiding in the family’s shelter, along with his grandmother. That shelter was completely destroyed in the bombing, but fortunately the boy and his grandmother were not killed. 
Alfadil, however, has remained behind with the IDP’s because it is so important to him that he go on teaching in the makeshift school that is providing primary education for approximately 700 students, with classes as large as 150. All the teachers, only some of whom are trained, work as volunteers. And there is hardly an exercise book or piece of chalk to be had. But as he sees it, “only through education will we defend our freedom.” 
Understandably, Alfadil had strong words for the international community. He noted that the people of the Nuba Mountains have told the world, repeatedly, what is happening. Yet nothing happens. So he asks: is that because we do not matter? 
The UN and the African Union must step up. There was minimal Security Council attention a couple of years back, which led to nothing and has faded away. African Union sponsored peace talks collapsed late last year and have not been restarted. 
Both of those bodies, along with individual governments including Canada, must now exert forceful pressure on the Sudanese government to do three things: stop the bombing, allow humanitarian access and protect human rights in Southern Kordofan. 
Because the people of the Nuba Mountains do matter; and this crisis must come to an end.

,  
In March, Amnesty International released the report ‘Unlawful and deadly: Rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict’, which focuses on the firing by Palestinian armed groups of thousands of unguided rockets and mortars towards Israel, during the fifty day war. 
,  
These indiscriminate attacks were a breach of international law which led to the deaths of both Israelis and Palestinians. Six Israeli civilians, including a four-year-old boy and a Bedouin man, were killed. Bedouin communities in Israel’s Negev/Naqab face increased risk as they do not benefit from shelters, missile defenses or warning sirens afforded to others in Israel. Thirteen Palestinians, including eleven children, were killed when a projectile believed to have been launched from within the Gaza Strip fell short of its intended target and struck the al-Shati refugee camp. 
,  
,  
Canada has not released a statement regarding the findings in the report. The Canadian government has, however, been a vocal opponent of Palestinian ICC membership – despite being a member itself – calling the move “a concerning and dangerous development” despite overwhelming international support for Palestinian accession at the United Nations. 
,  
Canada must support the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction over the Palestinian territory and take an evenhanded approach to such investigations, thereby helping to obtain justice for both Israeli and Palestinian victims, while reinforcing its reputation as a reliable human rights champion. Canada must call on Israel to grant full access to Amnesty International and other organizations to the Gaza Strip. 
,  
,  
1. The ICC would investigate Palestinian armed groups for IHL violations in Gaza 
, 	Israel claims Palestinian armed groups failed to take necessary precautions to protect civilians by using human shields and firing from built up civilian areas. Palestinian armed groups have denied taking these actions, and Israel has not provided any details to substantiate its claims. An investigation could help establish whether this was in fact the case. 
,  
2. The ICC would investigate Palestinian armed groups for IHL violations against Israel 
, 	IHL imposes obligations on all parties to armed conflict to “distinguish between civilians and combatants” and between “civilian objects” and “military objectives.” The firing of indiscriminate munitions towards Israel injuring or killing civilians constitutes a war crime. 
,  
3. An ICC investigation would examine Israeli claims that it abides by the rules of war 
, 	The Israeli government and the IDF have insisted that they “do not target civilians.” Yet, the vast majority of Palestinian casualties during the 2014 war were civilian. A full investigation allows the opportunity to verify Israel’s claims it had been targeting militants or military objectives in its attacks. 
,  
4. An ICC investigation would bring an end to the pattern of impunity enjoyed by perpetrators in previous conflicts 
, 	Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups both committed violations of  IHL in 2008-09 during Israel’s operation ‘Cast Lead’ and in 2012 during operation ‘Pillar of Defense.’ The prosecution of those responsible will help deter future violations and secure justice for victims. 
,  
5. Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute of the ICC is a positive development 
, 	The international community can apply more pressure on Palestine to incorporate human rights treaties to which they have now acceded into national law and practice; and to sign up to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICCPED). 
,  
6. Israeli retaliation for Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute is counter-productive 
, 	Punitive measures against Palestine by Israel – such as the withholding of vital tax revenues – not only harm the civilian population in the OPT, but also undermine the rights of its own citizens who might wish to seek and obtain justice through an ICC investigation. 
,  
7. The ICC continues to enjoy strong support despite cynical Israeli moves to block it 
, 	Israeli efforts which seek to undermine the ICC’s work by encouraging allies to cut funding have failed. Major donor countries such as Germany, U.K and France, who account for more than a third of the court’s budget, have rebuffed Israeli calls and continue to provide funding. Canada, for its part, has also said it has no plans to suspend its funding. 
, 	     
, 	8. An unprecedented demand for justice of victims of IHL violations in Gaza and Israel 
, 	Public sentiment in support of achieving justice for the victims is rising. This also extends to the situation in the occupied West Bank with a flourishing debate on settlement activity since Palestinian ICC membership, and increased calls for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip. 
,  
Bi-lateral negotiations have failed to end the violence or secure justice for the victims and alternative approaches to peacefully resolving the long-standing conflict are needed. Amnesty International urges both sides to cooperate with an ICC investigation into violations during the 2014 conflict. 
,  
We call on Palestinian authorities to denounce attacks targeting civilians and ensure armed groups comply with international law. 
,  
We call on Israeli authorities not to penalize Palestine for acceding to the Rome Statute, ensure Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab are adequately protected against any future attacks in line with other communities in Israel, completely lift the siege of the Gaza Strip, and desist in launching disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. 
,  
Amnesty International calls on Canadians to show evenhanded support for the ICC investigation into IHL violations committed by all parties to the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict. Canadians can lobby their local member of Parliament to demand that our government not undermine the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction over Palestinian territory in any way, to encourage all parties to co-operate with the ICC Prosecutor, and to demand that Israel grant Amnesty International and other international human rights organization researchers and investigators access to the Gaza Strip.

The Canadian government has, however, been a vocal opponent of Palestinian ICC membership – despite being a member itself – calling the move “a concerning and dangerous development” despite overwhelming international support for Palestinian accession at the United Nations. 
Canada must support the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction over the Palestinian territory and take an evenhanded approach to such investigations, thereby helping to obtain justice for both Israeli and Palestinian victims, while reinforcing its reputation as a reliable human rights champion. Canada must call on Israel to grant full access to Amnesty International and other organizations to the Gaza Strip. 
1. The ICC would investigate Palestinian armed groups for IHL violations in Gaza	Israel claims Palestinian armed groups failed to take necessary precautions to protect civilians by using human shields and firing from built up civilian areas. Palestinian armed groups have denied taking these actions, and Israel has not provided any details to substantiate its claims. An investigation could help establish whether this was in fact the case. 
2. The ICC would investigate Palestinian armed groups for IHL violations against Israel	IHL imposes obligations on all parties to armed conflict to “distinguish between civilians and combatants” and between “civilian objects” and “military objectives.” The firing of indiscriminate munitions towards Israel injuring or killing civilians constitutes a war crime. 
3. An ICC investigation would examine Israeli claims that it abides by the rules of war	The Israeli government and the IDF have insisted that they “do not target civilians.” Yet, the vast majority of Palestinian casualties during the 2014 war were civilian. A full investigation allows the opportunity to verify Israel’s claims it had been targeting militants or military objectives in its attacks. 
4. An ICC investigation would bring an end to the pattern of impunity enjoyed by perpetrators in previous conflicts	Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups both committed violations of  IHL in 2008-09 during Israel’s operation ‘Cast Lead’ and in 2012 during operation ‘Pillar of Defense.’ The prosecution of those responsible will help deter future violations and secure justice for victims. 
5. Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute of the ICC is a positive development	The international community can apply more pressure on Palestine to incorporate human rights treaties to which they have now acceded into national law and practice; and to sign up to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICCPED). 
6. Israeli retaliation for Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute is counter-productive	Punitive measures against Palestine by Israel – such as the withholding of vital tax revenues – not only harm the civilian population in the OPT, but also undermine the rights of its own citizens who might wish to seek and obtain justice through an ICC investigation. 
7. The ICC continues to enjoy strong support despite cynical Israeli moves to block it	Israeli efforts which seek to undermine the ICC’s work by encouraging allies to cut funding have failed. Major donor countries such as Germany, U.K and France, who account for more than a third of the court’s budget, have rebuffed Israeli calls and continue to provide funding. Canada, for its part, has also said it has no plans to suspend its funding.	    8. An unprecedented demand for justice of victims of IHL violations in Gaza and Israel	Public sentiment in support of achieving justice for the victims is rising. This also extends to the situation in the occupied West Bank with a flourishing debate on settlement activity since Palestinian ICC membership, and increased calls for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip. 
Bi-lateral negotiations have failed to end the violence or secure justice for the victims and alternative approaches to peacefully resolving the long-standing conflict are needed. Amnesty International urges both sides to cooperate with an ICC investigation into violations during the 2014 conflict. 
We call on Palestinian authorities to denounce attacks targeting civilians and ensure armed groups comply with international law. 
We call on Israeli authorities not to penalize Palestine for acceding to the Rome Statute, ensure Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab are adequately protected against any future attacks in line with other communities in Israel, completely lift the siege of the Gaza Strip, and desist in launching disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. 
Amnesty International calls on Canadians to show evenhanded support for the ICC investigation into IHL violations committed by all parties to the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict. Canadians can lobby their local member of Parliament to demand that our government not undermine the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction over Palestinian territory in any way, to encourage all parties to co-operate with the ICC Prosecutor, and to demand that Israel grant Amnesty International and other international human rights organization researchers and investigators access to the Gaza Strip.

In March, Amnesty International released its report entitled ‘Unlawful and deadly: Rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict.’ Coming just two weeks before Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), it is part of the ‘Nowhere to run for life, safety, justice’ campaign which demands accountability for human rights violations carried out by all parties during Israel’s operation in Gaza, codenamed ‘Protective Edge.’ 
,  
During fifty days of hostilities, Palestinian armed groups launched thousands of unguided rockets and mortars towards Israel in contravention of international law. Six civilians in Israel, including a four-year-old boy and a Bedouin man, died in the attacks. Bedouin communities in Israel’s Negev/Naqab area are particularly vulnerable as Israel does not provide them with shelters, missile defenses or warning sirens. Inside Gaza, thirteen Palestinian civilians, eleven of them children, were killed when a projectile believed to have been launched from the Gaza Strip fell short of its intended target and struck the al-Shati refugee camp. 
,  
A Hamas statement rejected the findings, saying the report relied on the Israeli version of events and is as such imbalanced. It added: “war crimes have clear specifications, according to the Rome Statute, that do not in any way apply to the Palestinian resistance, which was, is, and will defend its people.”

Israel, for its part, welcomed the report’s “highlighting of Hamas’s war crimes, including the deliberate targeting of Israel’s civilian population by thousands of rockets and mortars,” adding that it is “vigorously investigating its [own] conduct [during the conflict], aiming to draw lessons and minimize civilian harm.” In response to an urgent petition requesting that Israeli authorities provide Bedouin communities in the Negev/Naqab with protective facilities, state representatives told the Israeli High Court of Justice that the villagers themselves had primary responsibility for providing protection, and that the best protective measure the residents could take was to lie on the ground.

Follow Lama on Twitter @lamamfakih 
,  
As the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen resumed earlier this week, after a brief ceasefire, hospitals across the capital were getting ready to treat an influx of the wounded despite dwindling supplies of medicine and fuel. Doctors were going over detailed lists of needed medications, recruiting volunteer staff, and making black-market deals for overpriced diesel and fuel to keep generators and ambulances running. Some staff were taking up residence in the hospital to avoid the time and cost of travel to and fro. 
,  
But despite their best efforts, the needs of the war wounded far outweigh the services these medical workers can provide. Sanaa’s publicly-run Kuwait Hospital was one of several hospitals where staff said they had to send patients away, because essential equipment had become inoperable without electricity or fuel for generators. 
,  
I visited the hospital during a power outage. During the visit, an injured woman told me she had lost her adult son in an explosion in the Mount Nogum neighborhood of Sanaa on May 11. Shrapnel severed his head “like a sword,” she said. The blast had been triggered by an airstrike on a weapons storage facility in the neighborhood. 
,  
During the five-day ceasefire last week, I visited nine hospitals to gauge how they had been coping since the war began nearly two months ago. The medical workers at the hospitals I visited articulated the same challenges: no electricity for weeks, limited diesel to operate generators, a lack of hospital staff, and, critically, few medical supplies to treat the ill and wounded. They warned that ill and wounded civilians were paying the price for the restrictions imposed by the Saudi-led led coalition on life-saving assistance and basic goods needed for survival. 
,  
Amid dozens of anxious family members, beleaguered doctors and nurses were treating patients with whatever resources were at hand. In the al-Thawra hospital, where space was limited to treat the wounded, doctors were using corridors and waiting rooms for treatment. 
,  
Most of the civilian victims — including many children — had been injured by shrapnel. This had come from anti-aircraft weaponry fire that missed its target, failed to detonate in the air, and exploded on impact on the ground; from secondary explosions caused by airstrikes; and from the airstrikes themselves. Everywhere, I heard the same urgent demand for fuel to drive the generators that were the hospitals’ only source of power, and were needed to pump water. 
,  
“The diesel is running out,” a doctor at the Mutawakal private hospital told me. “We are having to buy it on the black market. We may have to close in a month if things continue like this.” 
,  
As a result of the fuel shortage, women experiencing complications in childbirth had been turned away, she said, and incubators in the hospital had been turned off. In another case, staff tried to resuscitate a patient experiencing cardiac arrest but could not place him on a ventilator. The patient died. The hospital, like so many others, was also suffering from a lack of vital medical supplies including antibiotics, painkillers, bandages, and blood. 
,  
The harsh and arbitrary restrictions imposed by the Saudi-led coalition on importing vital supplies, including fuel, have slowed to a trickle the flow of life-saving assistance and basic goods needed for survival. The World Food Programme (WFP) says it has managed to ship some 300,000 liters of fuel and other supplies into the country during the humanitarian ceasefire. But this shipment is only a fraction of the amount needed for the WFP’s operations in one month. 
,  
In a rare joint public statement, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders on May 4 expressed deep concern about the obstruction of deliveries of humanitarian aid, noting that the coalition’s restrictions on imports, “have made the daily lives of Yemenis unbearable, and their suffering immense.” 
,  
At al-Thawra hospital, doctors gave me a wish list of more than 100 vital medicines and supplies that they had run out of or were running low on. The hospital is the largest one treating the wounded in Sanaa — yet it is doing so with fewer and fewer staff. Doctors there said more than 300 foreign colleagues of theirs had left since the war began. The remaining local staff were often unable to reach the hospital because of insecurity, internal displacement, or petrol shortages arising from the conflict. As a result, the doctors I met had sometimes been working double and triple shifts — persisting despite a sense of futility over a war that keeps on bringing new wounded to their door. 
,  
The Saudi-led coalition should immediately facilitate further deliveries of fuel and life-saving assistance to Yemen. Ansar Allah and other armed groups operating on the ground should ensure this material is distributed unimpeded to the hospitals and humanitarian agencies that need it most.

The lives of Yemen’s civilians depend on it.

0,6 simple tools to protect your online privacy and help you fight back against mass surveillance,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-6-simple-tools-to-protect-your-online-privacy-and-help-you-fight-back-against-mass-surveillance/,"By Tanya O’Carroll,  Adviser to Amnesty International’s Technology and Human Rights Team As intelligence agencies hoover up more and more of our online communications, we’ve compiled a list of some simple apps and tools to help protect your privacy and make your calls, emails, texts...","By Tanya O’Carroll,  Adviser to Amnesty International’s Technology and Human Rights Team 
As intelligence agencies hoover up more and more of our online communications, we’ve compiled a list of some simple apps and tools to help protect your privacy and make your calls, emails, texts and chats more secure. 
Faced with the enormous power of agencies such as the NSA and GCHQ, it can feel like there is little we can do to fight back. However, there are some great ways you can take control of your private communications online. 
  
The six tools below, which have been designed with security in mind, are alternatives to the regular apps and software you use. They can give you more confidence that your digital communications will stay private. 
Note: No tool or means of communication is 100% secure, and there are many ways that governments are intercepting and collecting our communications. If you’re an activist or journalist, you should use these tools as part of a comprehensive security plan, rather than on their own. Additionally, this list is by no means comprehensive – we recommend checking out Security-in-a-Box (from Tactical Technology Collective and Front Line Defenders) and Surveillance Self-Defense (from the Electronic Frontier Foundation) too. 
TextSecure is an easy-to-use, free app for Android (iPhones have a compatible app called Signal). It looks a lot like WhatsApp and encrypts your texts, pictures, video and audio files. The app is open-source and provides end-to-end encryption. That means only you and the person you are sending to will be able to read the messages. (See below for an explanation of technical terms.) 
Redphone is another free, open-source app for Android (for iPhones it’s the same Signal app, which combines voice calls and messaging) which encrypts your voice calls end-to-end. All calls are over the internet, so you only pay for wifi or data rather than using your phone’s credit. 
meet.jit.si is a free and open-source service to secure your voice calls, video calls, video conferences, instant messages and file transfers. It runs directly in your browser with no need to download anything and allows you to invite multiple people to join a video call. It’s a bit like Google hangouts, but your calls and chats are encrypted end-to-end. There is also a desktop version called Jitsi which you can download for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android. 
This free and open-source plug-in for your web browser lets you encrypt files – including video, email attachments and photos – and share them with friends really easily. You can upload and send your file to selected contacts by using their unique miniLock id, meaning your file can only be downloaded by the person you share it with. 
This is a free add-on for your web browser which provides end-to-end encryption for your emails. It can be configured to work with almost any web-based email provider, including Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook. It’s open source and uses OpenPGP encryption. 
This service helps you back-up your files, sync between multiple devices and share files privately with people you trust. It fully encrypts your data end-to-end which means that, unlike other cloud sharing and storage services such as Dropbox, even the company itself cannot see your documents on its servers. SpiderOak charges $12 each month for a personal account. It’s not yet open-source. 
Encryption: This is a way of coding something that disguises the original form. Today’s modern encryption, when well implemented, can be virtually unbreakable. When encrypting and decrypting content, a complex password – known as a key – is used for authentication. Very often this key is held by the company that provides services such as email or website hosting. That means that the company has full access to your data. Governments can compel the company to hand over this information or can try to hack into a company’s server to get direct access. 
End-to-end encryption: With end-to-end encryption, the key is only known to you and never leaves your device. This means your communications stay between you and your correspondents only. To the company transmitting your communication – or anybody else who tries to intercept it – your messages will look like a long string of random numbers and letters. They can know who you communicated with but will not be able to access the contents. 
Open-source: Very often the code that makes up computer software is proprietary, meaning that whoever developed it has sole access to it. Open-source code is available for anyone to see and analyse. While it might seem counter-intuitive, this is widely considered to be the best way to make software secure. It helps ensure it doesn’t do anything nasty, like providing a ‘back door’ for intelligence agencies, and that any security weaknesses can be discovered and patched up.

Mr. President, 
,  
Amnesty International, a worldwide movement that campaigns for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all, is deeply concerned about the situation of a 10-year-old girl reportedly raped by her stepfather and pregnant as a result. The pregnancy was detected three weeks ago and yet the state continues to violate her human rights without offering her the possibility of an abortion. 
,  
To allow this girl who is just 10 years old to continue with her pregnancy is clearly cruel. Mr. President, the future of this girl is in your hands. 
,  
The facts speak for themselves. We have here the case of a 10-year-old girl from an underprivileged background, who has been raped and is now facing a future in which she, at a very young age, would be forced to become a mother. Rather than protecting her, the Paraguayan state has failed her for months. The girl’s mother already reported the sexual abuse by her stepfather last year, but the authorities were of the view that she was not at risk. Then, during February this year, the mother took her to several health centres after the child complained of stomach pain, there doctors suggested she could be suffering from parasites or a tumour. Only in late April did the doctors establish that she was 21 weeks pregnant. 
,  
Mr. President, I respectfully urge you, – as the highest authority of the Paraguayan State, to address this serious human rights violation perpetrated against this 10–year-old child. The consequences to this girl’s life and physical and mental integrity are grave, and will add immeasurable suffering to what she has already been through. I therefore urge you to grant her the option of terminating the pregnancy. 
,  
The World Health Organization considers that child pregnancies are extremely dangerous to the health of girls, as they can lead to complications and, in some cases, to death, especially as young girls’ bodies have not fully developed to bear a pregnancy. This is compounded by the severe emotional trauma of a girl who has been raped, which can only be exacerbated considerably by pregnancy, birth and motherhood, for which she is clearly not ready. 
,  
The combination of the girl’s powerlessness and absence of choice; her total reliance on the goodwill of the authorities; the severe pain she will suffer if she is forced to carry her pregnancy to term; and the intentional act by the authorities to coerce her into childbirth by denying her the option of abortion -based clearly on reasons of gender discrimination- would make the girl a victim of torture, a serious human rights violation and a crime under international law. 
,  
I hope that Your Excellency shows the world that the human rights of all girls are respected and protected in Paraguay without discrimination, and that the country, therefore, always prioritizes the child’s best interest, as established by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Every now and then there comes along a case that seems too tragic to comprehend — where cruelty from one individual to another is compounded and amplified by a callous governmental response. That is how I feel about the case of a 10-year-old pregnant girl, who was raped by her step-father, only to find the Paraguayan authorities are denying her the option of an abortion. 
,  
It is a story that has attracted attention from all over the world, with many shocked that a young child could be treated in such a way by her own government, which is supposed to protect her. 
,  
According to the World Health Organization child pregnancies are extremely dangerous for the health of young girls as they can lead to complications and death in some cases, especially as their bodies are “not fully developed to carry a pregnancy.” This 10 year old girl is facing a great risk to her life and physical and psychological health, both in the short, medium and long term. 
,  
We know that the girl’s mother asked, in the best interest of her daughter, for the pregnancy to be terminated, three weeks ago, back at the end of April. In Paraguay, access to abortion is restricted, but it is legal when the woman or girl’s life is at risk. Some medics have said that the girl will probably live through the pregnancy. The devastation it could reap on her body and mind do not seem to factor into this analysis. 
,  
So, instead of providing the abortion and the physical and psychological support that this 10 year old girl so desperately needs, she has been sent to a centre for “young mothers” and separated from her own mother, who, in another tragic step, is being detained for failing to protect the girl from the sexual abuse that resulted in the pregnancy. Forcibly parted from her mother and forced to continue with a pregnancy resulting from rape, the authorities are shamefully failing to protect this young girl. 
,  
I am not the only person to be outraged by this heart-breaking story. 
,  
Hundreds of thousands of people have written to President Horacio Cartes during the last week, urging him to ensure this 10-year-old girl is given the option of terminating the pregnancy. Amnesty International UK supporters have already sent more than 110,000 signatures to the President, a public reaction that is one of the biggest individual actions the UK office has ever seen. Tens of thousands more people have sent pledges from all over the world. 
,  
UN experts have expressed their concern as well, stating that the government of Paraguay has failed in its responsibility to protect the child and provide her with critical and timely treatments, including a “safe and therapeutic abortion”. 
,  
But this girl’s is not an isolated case. Sexual abuse and child pregnancy is all too common in Latin America which has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world 
,  
What is more, the limited access to abortions regularly pushes desperate women and girls to unsafe, clandestine abortions, which often end in death. The World Health Organization has reported that 13% of maternal deaths in South America are due to such procedures. 
,  
The truth is Paraguay’s abortion laws are sorely out of touch with its international human rights obligations. In March 2015 the United Nation’s Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights called on Paraguay to review and modify its abortion legislation to ensure its compatibility with other rights such as health and life. 
,  
So why don’t the Paraguayan authorities act? I think that unfortunately the reason is mainly one of discrimination, both against women and girls and against the poor; which is so rampant in my region. The sad truth is that Paraguayan law and wider society sees women’s primary role as being child bearers and mothers, as soon as they fall pregnant their choices become severely limited. 
,  
It is also the case that if this girl and her family had the economic means, if she belonged to a different social class, she would have had access to private health facilities, where she could have undergone an abortion, or been able to travel out of the country to access an abortion abroad. The state would have very likely stayed away from that private decision and wouldn’t have intervened. 
,  
Last year her mother complained to law enforcement authorities that the stepfather had been abusing her daughter, but they decided there was no evidence of any risk and didn’t investigate further. Well, she was obviously at risk. Under international human rights law the state has the responsibility to protect this girl from violence and to act with due diligence to guarantee her mental and physical health. Her best interests should be the priority now for all those that failed her in the past and have power over her future. 
,  
On Monday 11 May, a panel of experts met in Paraguay to assess her case. They now have three days to decide what options the girl should be granted based on an evaluation of her physical and psychological state. Will they put the girl’s human rights and best interest at the forefront of their recommendations? Or will they be guided by their own fears and prejudices? We will have to wait and see. But I hope they won’t fail her. For this young girl, time is running out.

SOUTHERN KORDOFAN – Time and again, as we have interviewed women, men and young people throughout Sudan’s besieged Southern Kordofan state, people have had not just one account of personal tragedy to share but several. 
,  
That is perhaps the most heartbreaking measure of how entrenched this human rights and humanitarian crisis has become. After four years, the people of Southern Kordofan have seen the violence and injustice come around several times: more bombs, more displacement, more hunger, more loss and more death.  This is a cruel campaign that does not only strike once. 
,  
These are not the stories of those caught on the front line by chance. But civilians deliberately targeted. 
,  
In none of the sites we visited did we see or hear of any evidence of nearby military targets that might have justified the attacks.  In fact one woman told me that the Antonov bombers spend much more time raining hell around villages and sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs), than they do at the front-lines of the fighting.   
,  
Alfadil Khalifa Mohamed, a teacher, emotionally told us of an Antonov attack at an IDP site in February.  When his wife, Nahid, who was eight months pregnant, heard the ominous droning of the plane, she ran to ensure children in the vicinity – including her own young son – made it to safety.   
,  
Nahid was struck down by shrapnel and killed immediately.  But the baby was still alive.   But in a region with only one surgical hospital still operating (days away by foot), there was nowhere to turn for medical attention to save the baby’s life. Numerous other hospital and clinics have closed or been scaled back after being bombed, sometimes repeatedly. 
,  
Two months later the Antonovs returned.  Alfadil and Nahid’s two year old son was hiding in the family’s shelter, along with his grandmother.  That shelter was completely destroyed in the bombing, but fortunately the boy and his grandmother were not killed.   
,  
, 	Alfadil speaking to Amnesty International researchers during the mission in Southern Kordofa.   Photo courtesy of Amnesty International 
,  
Alfadil then made arrangements to send his son to one of the refugee camps in South Sudan, where his wife’s mother now lives.  As he told us, “they killed my wife, they killed our baby, and they almost killed our son.  I cannot keep losing my family.”   
,  
Zainab, a 75 year old woman, surrounded by children of all ages busy either helping with chores or playing games, shared her family’s account of being displaced twice since 2012.  They fled first when their village was bombed and then had to flee again when their place of refuge (an IDP site) was similarly attacked a year later.   
,  
With resignation and certainty Zainab assured us that if we come back next year we will likely find that she has had to run away again. 
,  
Similarly, a family living in a small village on the edge of a large IDP site were terrorised in February of this year when a bomb loaded with cluster munitions landed on their property, causing considerable damage but fortunately not death or injury.  It was a close call and they decided to move into the IDP site – a long ribbon of shelters nestled into the base of the Nuba Mountains – in the hope that the rocks, crags and caves would offer protection.   
,  
But only two months later an Antonov attacked and a bomb landed near the site’s sorghum milling machine.  Shrapnel flew in many directions, and this newly displaced family’s two year-old daughter was one of seven who were killed. 
,  
For four years civilians have been under attack in Southern Kordofan.  The Sudanese military, determined at any cost to defeat the SPLA-North opposition that is fighting for greater autonomy for the state, has sealed opposition controlled areas off from the outside world. It has waged an unrelenting campaign of indiscriminate aerial and ground attacks clearly intended to terrorise the civilian population.

,  
, 	Antonov, MIG and Sukhoi aircraft rain bombs and missiles down from the air.  Long range shelling sends artillery rockets streaking into distant communities. Food crops have been destroyed with farmers too fearful to plant and harvest.  Sudan’s humanitarian blockade means food relief doesn’t get in; nor do badly needed medicines, or supplies and funding to support schools. 
,  
,  
,  
, 	However, in the face of such agonising hardship and misery, the resilience and determination we also encountered – everywhere – was nothing short of remarkable. 
,  
, 	Like Alfadil, despite all that has befallen him and his family, he remains loyal to serving as a teacher in the makeshift school that is providing primary education for approximately 700 students, with classes as large as 150.  The thirteen teachers, only some of whom are trained, work as volunteers, barely equipped with textbooks or even chalk. Amidst this despair, Alfadil still declares: “Only education will help us defend our freedom.” 
,  
, 	Along with his account of painful loss, safety for his son and inspirational commitment to teaching, Alfadil had strong words for the international community: “The people of the Nuba Mountains have told the world, repeatedly, what is happening.  People come, ask questions and we tell them.  So it is known; but nothing changes.  Nothing happens.  Is it because we do not matter?” A question he poses to a seemingly silent world.  
,  
, 	We assured him that Amnesty International would ensure that the world does not forget the people of Southern Kordofan – that everybody here matters very much.

But some brave activists are still standing up for their rights. To mark the International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) on 17 May, we celebrate the courageous activism of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people worldwide. 
 
	In Greece, LGBTI rights organizations tell us violent attacks on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity have more than doubled over the last year. In August 2014, Kostas and Zabi, a Greek-Pakistani gay couple, were brutally beaten up in a homophobic and racist attack in central Athens. 
“I think they could tell we are a couple, and they targeted us because of that and Zabi’s skin colour,” says Kostas (above). “Last thing I saw was Zabi being thrown on the pavement. My head and upper body was inside a trash-bin that they had overturned. A few seconds later they broke my leg in three places.” Zabi was then attacked again in March 2015. 
On this international day of action, activists from Greece and around the world are using the hashtag #KostasZabi to send support to the couple on social media, and to tell the Greek government to end hate crimes and stand against homophobia and racism. Greek activists, including Kostas and Zabi, will organize a ‘kiss-in’ in front of Parliament to highlight their case and the situation for LGBTI people in the country. 
 
	In Cameroon same-sex sexual conduct is punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine, and LGBTI people suffer violence, police harassment and even arrest and detention. 
In 2013, Eric Lembembe, director of a Cameroon AIDS charity, was murdered for his work defending LGBTI people . Two years later, his killers have still not been brought to justice. This July, activists will brave the hostile atmosphere in the country to organise two days of action in his memory. They will call for justice for Eric, and for an end to homophobic violence against LGBTI people and those who defend them. 
In 2011, Stéphane, a 36-year old gay man, was dragged away from his house by a group of men, stripped, beaten and tortured for hours. Four years later, the men who attacked him have not faced justice. But that has not stopped Stéphane. “Today my fight is so that my younger brothers or my friends don’t suffer discrimination like this,” he tells us. “I am alive today and I want to be an example, a living example. I will keep telling my story for as long as I can.” 
Across Central Asia, homophobia and transphobia is on the rise. Police blackmail gay men, threatening to ‘out’ them to family and colleagues unless they agree to pay a bribe. Lesbian women face violence and abuse from within their families, and may be forced to marry against their will. 
One example is Komil, a gay man from Tajikistan was kidnapped, tortured, beaten and humiliated by police , and was eventually forced to flee the country. “Can you understand spending your whole life hiding that you are gay just to stay alive?” he tells us. “I am not a politician. I am a simple person who just wants a tiny piece of his own happiness. That is all.” With the help of his friends, he has rebuilt his life, and now speaks out for LGBTI rights in the region. 
 
	Latvia will be the first post-Soviet country to host EuroPride – a Europe-wide event dedicated to promoting LGBTI rights. In 2015, the event also celebrates a decade since Riga held its first Pride event: when 70 activists marched for their rights in spite of threats of violence and hostility from several thousand protestors. 
Organizers of EuroPride hope to use this opportunity to draw global attention to the state of LGBTI rights in the region. They’ll also march in solidarity with people in countries like Russia, where authorities refuse applications to hold Pride events and where LGBTI activists organising peaceful street events are frequently attacked, with little protection from the police. 
 
 
John Jeanette Remø Solstad is a 65-year-old transgender Norwegian woman who wants to change her legal gender from ‘male’ to ‘female’. But the government says she can’t – unless she has compulsory medical treatment, including surgery which will leave her sterile. It also requires a psychiatric diagnosis, as transgender people are considered ‘mentally ill’. John Jeanette refuses to put herself through this, and has campaigned alongside Amnesty supporters to change the law. 
In April 2015, an expert group appointed by the Norwegian government stated that the current practice is a violation of fundamental human rights, and stressed the need for change. “this is everything I have dreamt of and hoped for,” she told us. “It was worth the fight. It took a long time, but when the results of our work finally came, it felt great.” The Norwegian government now has the opportunity to implement the recommendation and change these discriminatory laws.

My journey with Amnesty started nearly four decades ago. I remember growing up wanting to make life better for someone else. But I didn’t see myself as a leader, and kept asking “What could I do?”

    – Amnesty International

,  
At first, I simply worked on the local Amnesty group newsletter and letter-writing. Then our group was assigned a Singaporean prisoner of conscience for action, on whose dossier I was made responsible – a daunting task. Later I was asked to become Amnesty Canada’s permanent Country Coordinator on Singapore and Malaysia. 
,  
The same questions kept leaping to mind: “But what could I do?” After all I was just a little brown mouse? 
,  
But my path along the Amnesty trail helped show me that I could scale mountains. I never thought, for example, that a former President of Singapore would become a dissident, leave Singapore, choose to live 10 minutes away from me; join Amnesty and become my friend. 
,  
I remember priceless moments such when prominent prisoner of conscience Dr. Munawar Anees from Malaysia asked to meet me. Tears filled his eyes. “Amnesty saved my life,” he told me.

Of course, there have been many difficult moments. But sad moments do not shake my faith in Amnesty. Over the years I’ve seen momentous worldwide change in attitudes to human rights. 
,  
The little brown mouse that I was in the early 1970s, so anxious to make a difference, has radically changed. Amnesty has turned it into a roaring lion! 
,  
I want Amnesty to continue its amazing, ground-shaking work. Leaving a gift in my will enables me to do just that. I can think of no better way of ensuring justice and dignity for future generations.

People leaving gifts to Amnesty in their wills represented 8.6% of our global income in 2013: €20.6 million. It’s our second biggest income source, after individual donations (81%).

The refugee camps of Yida and Adjoung Thok...","In a forgotten corner of South Sudan – a country itself mired in war, human rights violations and a staggering humanitarian catastrophe – refugees from a largely overlooked human rights crisis continue to arrive and continue to face immense challenges. 
The refugee camps of Yida and Adjoung Thok lie inside the northern tip of the country’s Unity State (a cruelly ironic name for a state that has seen some of the worst fighting in the country’s current civil war), very close to the border that was etched into atlases when it gained independence from Sudan in July 2011. 
They have  arrived here from neighbouring Sudan’s Southern Kordofan state, where an overlooked human rights crisis has played out during four unrelenting years of armed conflict and at the Sudanese armed forces’ massive and indiscriminate military assault. 
These refugees number around 95,000 and continue to arrive daily. Just imagine the desperation that makes fleeing to war ravaged South Sudan, a more attractive option than enduring the bombing, terror and hunger in Southern Kordofan.   
In Unity State, refugees are primarily divided between two camps: 70,000 in Yida, where we are today, and another 25,000 in nearby Adjoung Thok. This is the third time in three years that I have been to Yida with an Amnesty team. Already I feel heavy with the familiarity of the immense challenges here, and determined that we must press harder for solutions that ensure the rights of an incredibly vulnerable population are upheld.   
Since it was set up in 2011, there has been controversy about Yida’s location, only some 20 kilometres from the border with a country where war continues to rage between the Sudanese military and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army – North (SPLA-N) opposition forces.    
  
  
We were here in 2012 and there were efforts under way to encourage refugees to move to a new camp, Nyel, which it was feared would turn into a swampy bog during the rainy season.  That failed.  We were here in 2013 and the plan was a move to the new Adjoung Thok site. This time refugees feared it took them closer to a border area controlled by the Sudanese military, whereas the border near Yida is patrolled by the SPLA-N.   
With time, however, Adjoung Thok has begun to fill up, mainly with newly arriving refugees (there have been 10,000 since the end of December, the dry season which saw a spike in bombings in Southern Kordofan). 
Those debates about location and moving were fraught with legitimate fears and rampant rumours.  They were about sticking to refugee protection principles, but politics have played a role as well. 
And so, on this current visit it comes as no surprise that the first topic on everyone’s mind is, again, a new site and plans to move. And once again there is disagreement. The South Sudanese government has approved one site, now backed by the UN and donor states; refugee leaders are pressing for another. It is not at all clear how it will unfold. There is no prospect of forcing refugees onto trucks at gunpoint. But there are many other forces pushing and pulling them in several different directions. 
Particularly telling for me today were the words from one of the leaders in the camp, variations of which I’ve heard before. He asked: why don’t our views matter? Why don’t we get to decide about our own security, where we will send our kids to school, and where we will try to rebuild our lives by growing a bit of food? I remembered the fiery insistence of a refugee woman on my last visit that she was the one, better than anyone, who knew where she and her children would be safest. 
One pressing concern that has repeatedly come up so poignantly every time I have been here is education. It has again certainly been prominent in all of our conversations in the camp today. 
Because international donors think refugees shouldn’t be settling in Yida for the long term, they have refused to fund a number of programmes and initiatives that they fear would give it a sense of permanence. That has included schools. Imagine the numbers of school-age children in a camp of 65,000 people. There are around 16,000 of primary school age alone. Four years into Yida’s existence, there are no schools funded by the international community – four wasted years in a child’s life. No UNICEF blue backpacks, no teachers salaried by the European Union, no notebooks and pencils coming in from Canada and Australia, no schools constructed by South Africa. This is despite the fact that all children, whatever their circumstances, have a right to free and compulsory primary education. 
Schools are on offer in Adjoung Thok of course; and that is meant be an incentive to move there. It has encouraged some, but most remain at Yida. So thousands of students are learning in makeshift schools built with the same rudimentary materials as the shelters they sleep in. Volunteers from among the refugee community (some of whom were teachers, most not) do their best to teach. And refugee families are asked to pay a school fee (the equivalent of about $4 per year, which most families here struggle to come up with, and which runs contrary to that universal right to free primary education). 
Regardless of the merits of Yida versus Adjoung Thok, or of the two locations that are the subject of the current dispute, there is something worrying about using such an important human right, the right to education, as a bargaining chip. 
Because as one leader put it to us today, when you stop education, you lose a generation. And this overlooked crisis in a forgotten corner cannot afford that loss.

“We have faith that Amnesty International’s campaigning will inform investors in Tahoe Resources about our suffering in Guatemala.” Resident of San Rafael Las Flores 
,  
When Alex Neve and I visited San Rafael Las Flores, Santa Rosa province, the site of Tahoe’s Escobal mine, in September 2014, it was to present the findings of our report, Mining in Guatemala: Rights at Risk and seek feedback from local grassroots activists. We hoped that community members, activists, legal experts, investors and governments would find it useful in untangling some of the problems with Guatemala’s mining regulatory framework and outline how the government and companies are failing human rights. It was clear from our research that current mining regulations and corporate practices are stoking conflict in Guatemala, leading to serious human rights violations, and that change is desperately needed.  
,  
During that meeting, the very people who had been living through several years of frustration, fear, criminalisation, militarization of their towns, threats and incredible stress, told us they had faith in us to carry their message of suffering and resistance to decision-makers and investors in Canada. It is a message we have taken to heart. 
,  
Since October, Amnesty International Sections throughout the world have met with their Foreign Affairs departments, Guatemalan Ambassadors, investment banks and shareholders in companies operating in Guatemala to share the findings and recommendations of our report. In these meetings, we reiterated the message given to us by residents, like the man who said, “We want to take part in these decisions about our future, but those in power don’t want and won’t let us participate. Instead, they criminalize us”. 
,  
Mine critics under threat 
,  
Since 2011, over 90 activists in the province of Santa Rosa have found themselves facing charges ranging from uttering threats to femicide (a special law in Guatemala against violence directed to women) to hiring hitmen to killing political opponents.  All of these charges were later dropped by the courts due to lack of evidence. But the financial, psychological and reputational cost to the people facing these charges has been unimaginable.  Still, people told us in September: “We will continue to oppose the mine because of the impacts on our environment and our food sources”. 
,  
In 2012, the Guatemalan Public Prosecutor’s Office of Crimes Against the Environment launched an investigation into a legal claim that the company’s activities were causing water contamination. In April 2015, Carlos Roberto Morales Monzón, the Administrative Manager and Legal Representative to Tahoe’s subsidiary, Minera San Rafael, , was arrested and denied bail by a Guatemalan judge in relation to the case. The trial date is set for June 12. Tahoe issued a press statement on April 14 saying they would appeal his detention. He is not the company’s only current or former employee in custody. 
,  
The company’s former head of security, Peruvian national Alberto Rotondo, has been in preventative detention since his arrest in April 2013 while attempting to leave the country. On April 27, 2013,  residents allege that he ordered guards under his command to fire rubber bullets and tear gas at unarmed protestors. According to documents filed in an ongoing civil claim in BC Supreme Court, Rotondo wanted to prevent protestors from establishing a permanent protest camp near the mine, such as the La Puya protest camp just outside Guatemala City, which was set up in protest against another Canadian gold mine. 
,  
“It’s with bullets they learn,” Alberto Rotondo 
,  
Wiretap surveillance of Mr Rotondo was ordered by the Attorney General prior to the April 27 shootings. The recordings reveal how Mr. Rotondo ordered his underlings to break shields to make it look like they were attacked, pick up shell casings, collude with police on a version of events (“the protestors attacked us”), and how he arranged to flee the country. In a press release issued after the shootings, Tahoe down-played the attack, saying that guards shot protestors with rubber bullets in self-defence. One man, however, required reconstructive facial surgery and lost the ability to smell as a result of his injuries.  Last month, the company was in BC Supreme Court asking Justice Laura Gerow to decline jurisdiction to hear the civil claim against it. The 7 men who launched the civil suit against Tahoe for negligence and battery do not believe they will receive justice in Guatemala and have argued the case should be rightly heard in Canada. A decision by Justice Gerow is expected in June. 
,  
Tahoe’s practices questioned in several countries 
,  
Norway’s Council on Ethics, which advises Norway’s Government Pension Fund – Global, investigated the allegations and came to the conclusion, after research and an exchange of letters with the company, that the company’s operations pose risks to human rights and that Tahoe Resources should not be eligible for investment. They are not the only investor questioning their relationship with the company. 
,  
The company has run into other kinds of trouble. In April 2015, the Guatemalan courts suspended the company’s preliminary environmental impact study for its Juan Bosco exploration licence application. Juan Bosco is a new project located within the company’s more than-2000 square kilometer concession. Residents say they are very worried about the potential impacts on their water supplies. Neighboring Xinka Indigenous communities who believe they would be adversely impacted by the mine say they have not been consulted nor has their consent been sought by the company or the Government. The Xinka leadership has been clear that it opposes mining in the region. 
,  
Tahoe investors need to raise questions 
,  
None of this can be good news for Tahoe investors meeting in Vancouver today. Earlier this year, Tahoe Resources merged with another Vancouver-based firm, Rio Alto Mining Limited. In his letter to shareholders in the company’s Management Circular, outgoing CEO Kevin McArthur, who will remain as Chairman of the Board, assured investors that, “Escobal is a model of environmental excellence and corporate social responsibility”. The record seems to indicate otherwise, or at the very least, raise troubling questions about the company’s commitment to environmental excellence and, perhaps more appropriately, corporate accountability. 
,  
While in Guatemala in September, Alex and I delivered a copy of our report to the powerful business lobby, the Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations (CACIF). Committee members were visibly alarmed to learn that investors are growing increasingly concerned about the risks associated with mining investments in Guatemala. It is our hope that today, in Vancouver, Tahoe investors raise the important questions that need to be raised with the company’s board of directors and senior management. 
,  
The men, women and children we met with in San Rafael Las Flores last year expect investors to open their eyes and ears to the suffering they have experienced and to refuse to allow business to continue as usual. As long as Guatemala continues to ignore its human rights responsibilities to mining-affected communities and companies refuse to meet at a minimum the human rights responsibilities set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the potential for further violence is real. Investors need to question whether they wish to be part of it, or if they wish to use their leverage to bring about much-needed change in corporate policies and practices. We sincerely hope it is the latter.

And we’ve been moved, and often angered by stories of abuse and indifference that have been shared with us...","In almost two weeks of travel in the Peace River region and up to Fort Nelson, British Columbia, we’ve had the privilege of spending time with many inspiring activists and leaders. And we’ve been moved, and often angered by stories of abuse and indifference that have been shared with us by families of missing and murdered women and by women and girls who have experienced horrific violence in their own lives. 
But one of the richest experiences of this visit was the opportunity earlier this week to travel with elders from the Doig River First Nation to K’iht saa?dze, the area they’re trying to protect for future generations as a tribal park. 
Elder Margaret Davis calls K’iht saa?dze a healing place. “Our people, a long time ago, we used to camp up here every summer. This is where we taught our kids about our culture and how to live off the land.” Today, Margaret says, “When something goes wrong and we feel really down, we come up here and spend all day. It’s a healing place for us.” 
To get to K’iht saa?dze, we drove by sprawling farm fields and landscapes dotted with oil wells or criss-crossed with pipelines, and by countless roads often sealed off to be accessed only by industry. In contrast, although there has been some logging and other development in  K’iht saa?dze, the area has been largely protected. 
“As long as I can remember, we’ve depended on K’iht saa?dze,” said Sam Acko. “There’s medicine we use from K’iht saa?dze that we can’t find anywhere else except here. Then there’s different kinds of trees that we can find here like balsam. In the past, there’s been disturbances like the road here and some logging on the south side. What we’re saying is, that’s enough.” 
Led by the community elders, the Doig River First Nation issued a statement in 2011 declaring 90,000 hectares of land spanning the Alberta- British Columbia border as protected tribal park. 
The people of Doig River want to see an end to new leases being granted in the park, existing operations gradually phased out, and the environment restored. 
The park land is part of their traditional territory, and protected by Treaty 8, but is outside their reserve boundaries. Doig River First Nation has been able to convince a number of companies to withdraw from the park, but the provincial governments of BC and Alberta continue to resist the idea of declaring the area off limits to further oil and gas development. 
Elder Tom Attachie said, “What we want to do, they won’t let us. That’s wrong. It’s our land. We want to keep this K’ihtsaa?dze for the next generation.” 
During our time in the region, we’ve learned not only about the many ways in which the rights of Indigenous peoples have been violated, over many decades and into the present day, but also about the innovative steps being taken by many First Nations and organizations to help undo these harms and protect their rights for future generations. K’iht saa?dze Tribal Park is a particularly clear and concrete illustration of the fact that when Indigenous peoples say no to particular development projects, they are often doing so because they have an alternative vision they are working toward, based on their own values and needs. 
Sam Acko said,  “A spiritual place like this shouldn’t be disturbed like that. What we’re fighting for now is our grandkids and their grandkids futures.”

Those are just a few of the many testimonies gathered by the media here from relatives of the Senegalese men among the more than 800 who lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea during the night of April 19th.

	Testimonies from survivors are often the only source of information available. Senegal newspapers have reported that at least 13 men were among the more than 800 who died when their boat capsized. But the numbers could be much higher.

Amnesty International has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Israel  regarding Public Diplomacy Cooperation ( MOU) which was concluded between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries on 18 January, 2015. 
,  
Amnesty International is concerned that various provisions in the MOU may lead to infringements of the right to freedom of expression, which is enshrined in both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international human rights treaties binding on Canada. The MOU is grounded in a shared concern about “efforts to single out the State of Israel for criticism”, noting in particular “calls for a boycott of the State of Israel, for the divestment of investments, and for sanctions to be imposed on Israel.”  The MOU refers to “selective targeting of Israel” as being the “new face of anti-Semitism.”  The MOU commits Canada and Israel to “work together to oppose efforts to single out or isolate the State of Israel.”  In that regard there is particular reference to: 
,  
i. Developing a coordinated, public diplomacy initiative both bilaterally and in international and multilateral fora to oppose boycotts of Israel, its institutions and its people within three to six months; 
,  
ii. Publically expressing their opposition to those who would call into question the State of Israel’s very right to exist or to defend itself, by itself; 
,  
iii. Engaging in annual consultations to identify opportunities to advocate in favour of the State of Israel’s full participation in the global economy. 
,  
Amnesty International reminds both the Canadian and Israeli governments of their obligation not only to refrain from violating the right to freedom of expression but their full responsibility actively to uphold and safeguard that essential human right.  Language in the MOU that talks of opposing criticism of Israel, opposing boycotts and in particular expressing to “opposition to those” who would call Israel’s existence or right of self-defence into question raises very real concerns about respect for freedom of expression.  
,  
When it comes to a government’s obligations with respect to freedom expression there is a very important difference between “opposing criticism” and “responding to criticism”.  Unless criticism involves criminal acts that are, when narrowly and proportionately described, recognized to be legitimate exceptions to freedom of expression, such as hate speech provisions in the Criminal Code, governments are barred from curtailing or prohibiting expression.  In fact they should ensure that the space and opportunity for offering such criticism, particularly when it is contrary to the government’s views and policies, is fully protected.  
,  
It is of course entirely legitimate for a government to respond to the substance of any such criticism by expressing a contrary view and by correcting or clarifying misinformation or mistakes, and to do so vigorously and unapologetically.  It is a violation of international human rights law to oppose the offering of the criticism itself. 
,  
Amnesty International is not aware whether the diplomacy initiative referred to above has yet been developed.  It is not clear, therefore, what measures either government might have taken or intend to take pursuant to this MOU.  
,  
In the preamble to the MOU the Canadian and Israeli governments reaffirm their “dedication to the shared values of freedom of expression and assembly, democracy and the rule of law.”  Amnesty International urges that no steps be taken further to this MOU or otherwise that would directly or indirectly undermine or violate those fundamental values.

Follow Alex on Twitter @AlexNeve Amnesty 
,  
The rushed passage through Parliament of Bill C-51, the furthest-reaching national security reforms in Canada since 2001, continues.  It is soon to be passed by the House of Commons and then head off to the Senate.  And all signs are that the government intends to push it through the Senate as quickly as possible, with an eye to the Bill becoming law before the summer Parliamentary break. 
,  
Debate in the House at both second and third reading has been limited.  The numbers of hearing sessions before the Committee charged with giving it careful and thorough review were far less than required.   It still defies belief, for instance, that faced with a Bill that will lead to a new statute establishing the most expansive information sharing framework Canadians have ever seen, the government refused to invite the country’s Privacy Commissioner to testify before the Committee. 
,  
Despite the fact that feedback in front of and outside the Committee has been sweeping in its criticism of the numerous new powers, procedures and criminal offences included in Bill C-51, the government has only agreed to a tiny handful of amendments which, at best, could be said to tweak and tinker.  
,  
Advocacy, protest, dissent and artistic expression 
,  
The only slight improvement in that minimal tweaking clarified that all forms of advocacy, protest, dissent and artistic expression, and not only those considered to be “lawful” (which was not defined but was thought to limit its reach to protests, for instance, which obtain municipal permits and do not involve civil disobedience) will be exempted from the reach of the new information sharing regime.  Amnesty International and many other organizations and experts had noted the obvious; the earlier formulation would almost certainly infringe rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. 
,  
That same change was not, however, made to the unprecedented new powers granted to CSIS to take action to reduce threats to the security of Canada.  Those powers are still subject to the much narrower limitation that it is only “lawful” (again not defined) advocacy, protest or dissent that is protected and thus excluded from the range of security threats that could be subject to these new powers. 
,  
Notably, when we turn to the existing legal provision that defines ‘terrorist activity’ in the Criminal Code, we find yet another formulation of the protection afforded to those involved in protest and dissent.  Here it is “advocacy, protest dissent or stoppage of work” that is exempted from the scope of that criminal offence.  
,  
It leaves things, to say the least, in a confused state. 
,  
Any protest, dissent or advocacy, lawful or not, is protected when it comes to information sharing and criminal prosecutions.  (Unless of course the protest involves violence or other action that clearly brings it within other aspects of the definitions of terrorist activity or security threats.)  But when it comes to CSIS disrupting security threats, only lawful protest is safe. 
,  
Then we have the fact that ‘artistic expression’ is explicitly protected when it comes to information sharing, but not with respect to threat reduction and criminal powers.  Furthermore there is no explanation as to why it is limited to ‘artistic expression’ and not simply to all forms of expression.  Under international human rights law and the Canadian Charter of Rights, freedom of expression is, of course, by no means limited to artistic expression. 
,  
And the inconsistencies continue.   
,  
	‘Work stoppages’ are specifically excluded from the definition of ‘terrorist activity’ in the Criminal Code but are absent in the information sharing and threat reduction provisions. 
,  
Amnesty International has highlighted that at a minimum all three of these national security powers – information sharing, threat reduction and criminal law – must provide the same level of protection for advocacy, protest and dissent; and that it must align with international human rights standards.  We have urged that all be amended to exempt advocacy, protest, dissent, artistic and other expression, and work stoppages from the definition of threats to the security of Canada and of terrorist activity. 
,  
But this of course is tinkering and tweaking. 
,  
Fundamentally, the many deeply troubling provisions in Bill C-51 that either undermine or directly violate Canada’s international human rights obligations remain unchanged. 
,  
CSIS threat reduction powers 
,  
The new CSIS threat reduction powers top that list, with no definition of the scope of the new powers (other than specifying it does not allow killing, committing bodily harm, violating sexual integrity, or perverting justice).  The Bill actually contemplates that the powers might involve Charter violations, for which – stunningly – a judicial warrant would have to be sought.  Judges issuing those warrants are, outrageously, told to disregard other laws, including the laws of the country in which CSIS may be intending to carry out its activities. 
,  
Still of concern, as well, is the new criminal offence of promoting or advocating commission of terrorism offences “in general” (of course undefined).  There has been across the board condemnation that this is a vague, broad over-reach that will violate free expression and, more insidiously, significantly chill free expression even before it reaches the stage of criminal charges.   The government has never explained why this new provision is needed in addition to the many existing offences which already criminalize, for instance, counselling, threatening, planning and conspiring to commit terrorist acts. 
,  
Almost limitless information sharing 
,  
Amnesty International continues to be deeply concerned about the expansive, almost limitless information sharing regime which fails to include limits and safeguards to ensure that irrelevant, inaccurate and inflammatory information is not shared. 
,  
Also still troubling are the expanded powers of preventive detention, allowing arrests without charge; and a weak appeal process for individuals who seek to have their names removed from no-fly lists. 
,  
In our recent updated submission to the Senate we have also called for provisions that would restrict the access that Special Advocates have to all the evidence that government lawyers put in front of judges in security-related immigration proceedings, to be withdrawn.   Procedures such as security certificates and other immigration hearings involving national security accusations are already unfair and highly secretive.  Special Advocates were introduced following a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that found the security certificate system violated the Charter.  They are hamstrung in the role they can play as they are generally not allowed to communicate with the individual concerned after they have seen the secret evidence.  
,  
Bill C-51 would make it possible for information that is not directly relevant to the accusations the individual faces to be withheld from Special Advocates, as long as it is not relied upon by the judge in the final decision and is returned to the government by the judge.  It is a rather sinister and kafkaesque prospect of presenting evidence to judges, withholding it from the ‘other side’ and then agreeing in the end it is irrelevant and should be taken back from the judge.  It does nothing to bring confidence and fairness to an already unfair and lopsided process and should be abandoned. 
,  
Effective review and robust oversight 
,  
Amnesty International has also flagged crucial overarching concerns that apply to the entirety of Bill C-51 and, in fact, all existing national security laws.  The first is the longstanding and urgent need to bring comprehensive and effective review, alongside robust parliamentary oversight, to national security in Canada.  We lag far behind our closest allies in this respect.  The second is to give some force to the oft repeated rhetoric that national security and human rights can and do co-exist, by legislating a clear human rights framework for Canada’s national security regime.  Both have been unequivocally rebuffed and rejected by the government. 
,  
All expectations are that Bill C-51 will have very little time in the Senate before it passes into law.  Nevertheless it is crucial that we continue to speak out and voice our concerns.  At its heart Bill C-51 grounds itself in the flawed notion that human rights have to give way when national security is on the line.  
,  
We must continue to remind our own government and governments around the world that it the precise opposite is true.  Living up to the full range of human rights obligations is the best guarantee of security; security for all of us.

,  
The global campaigns of support for the magazine’s work sent the unequivocal message that no one should pay with their lives the price of exercising their right to freedom of expression. 
,  
But behind this single story that dominated the international news headlines are thousands of media professionals who, in every corner of the world, are harassed, intimidated, threatened, tortured and unfairly jailed by governments and armed groups in a vile attempt to prevent them from holding up a mirror to society. 
,  
In countries such as Mexico and Pakistan, owning a press card is so dangerous that many media professionals end up quitting their jobs altogether, out of utter fear. 
,  
According to Reporters without Borders, 22 journalists and media workers have been killed and more than 160 have been imprisoned in 2015 alone. Nearly 100 media professionals were killed because of their work in 2014. 
,  
Those responsible for attacking and killing journalists very rarely face justice. 
,  
“Wherever you look in the world you will find the story of a journalist who has been harassed, threatened, unfairly jailed and even killed by a government or an armed group in a bid to stop them from reporting on issues seen as controversial,” said Susanna Flood, Media Director at Amnesty International. 
,  
“More and more, we are seeing governments less willing to tolerate dissent and being prepared to do anything to stop journalists from speaking out and informing the public. The message seems to be ‘if you dare to report on human rights issues you should be ready to spend time in prison or even be killed.” 
,  
Shooting the messenger 
, 	In Pakistan, one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist, media workers routinely face harassment, intimidation, abduction, torture and killings at the hands of the military and intelligence services, political parties and armed groups. 
,  
Since 2008, it is estimated that 40 journalists have been killed as a direct consequence of their work reporting on issues such as national security and human rights violations. 
,  
As far as Amnesty International is aware, the Pakistani courts only convicted individuals in the cases of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl, killed in 2002 and GEO News reporter Wali Khan Babar, killed in 2014. 
,  
Attacks against others, such as Hamid Mir, a journalist working for GEO TV who narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Karachi last year, have gone unpunished with investigations stalled. 
,  
Trumped up charges 
, 	For thousands of other people working in media outlets, punishment comes in the form of long prison sentences on trumped up charges. 
,  
Mahmoud Abu Zeid, an Egyptian photojournalist known as “Shawkan” has been detained more than 600 days as punishment for taking pictures of the violent dispersal of the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in in August 2013. He is yet to be formally charged with any crime and is languishing in a small cell in the infamous Tora Prison in Cairo. 
,  
“I share a cell that measures three by four metres with 12 political prisoners. We have no access to sun or fresh air for days or weeks at a time. I am a photojournalist, not a criminal. My indefinite detention is psychologically unbearable. Not even animals would survive in these conditions,” he recently said in a letter published by Amnesty International. 
,  
Shawkan’s story is far from unusual. Since President Morsi was ousted in July 2013, scores of journalists have been arrested or sentenced across Egypt as punishment for their work. Eighteen of them are still languishing behind bars with little hope of freedom. 
,  
Just like in Egypt, many governments across the world misuse the courts to prevent journalists from reporting on human rights issues or to punish those who do. 
,  
Mayan journalist Pedro Canché Herrera has been in jail since he was detained on 30 August 2014 for the alleged crime of sabotage in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. He was arrested days after publishing footage of a protest by citizens of the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto outside the office of the local water board over increased rates and charges. 
,  
Raids, intimidation and harassment 
, 	Governments also resort to raids and intimidation and harassment of journalists to stop them from reporting on issues they would rather keep off the public agenda. 
,  
In late December 2014, Bosnian authorities raided the offices of the popular news portal klix.ba, and pressured journalists to reveal their sources in relation to a leaked audio recording allegedly uncovering high-level bribery. 
,  
Police confiscated laptops, 19 hard drives and private mobile phones in an operation that lasted seven hours and saw some of the equipment destroyed. An editor and a journalist were detained for questioning and later released without charges. A judicial review later found that the raid was unlawful as it violated the constitutional rights of the journalists. 
,  
Witnesses to armed conflict 
, 	From Iraq to the Central African Republic, Colombia, Nigeria and Syria, journalists have faced threats and violence while trying to shed light onto the abuses faced by millions of men, women and children caught up in some of the world’s most violent conflicts. 
,  
Journalist Hamza Idris has faced intimidation at the hands of the Nigerian security forces because of his reporting. In 2014, after he published an article criticizing the military’s failure to properly protect civilians, eight soldiers stormed his office. 
,  
“They took the office manager and another member of staff to the 7 Division Headquarters at the Maimalari Barracks. Although they were eventually released, it was very frightening. We journalists are targets for everyone.” 
,  
Many kilometres away from Nigeria, in Colombia, journalists continue to be threatened and even killed for exposing human rights violations and abuses committed in the context of the country’s long-running armed conflict and the corrupt links some state officials have with illegal armed groups and organized crime. 
,  
According to Colombia’s Foundation for Press Freedom (Fundación para la Libertad de Prensa, FLIP), 26 journalists have been threatened and at least one killed so far this year. 
,  
On 21 January, five journalists, as well as many human rights defenders who accompany victims of forced displacement and land grabs, were named in a written death threat signed by the paramilitary group Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia. Those named were labelled as guerrilla collaborators. 
,  
Iraq is also an extremely dangerous place for journalists. The Baghdad bureau chief for Reuters, Ned Parker, had to leave the country in April after he was threatened on social media and on a TV channel owned by a Shi’a militia. The intimidation followed his reporting on human rights abuses committed by government forces and Shi’a militias during the liberation of Tikrit from ISIS. 
,  
“Journalism is not a crime. Media professionals are the eyes and ears of society. Governments have the responsibility to ensure they are able to report freely on human rights issues and without fear of being attacked or killed while doing their legitimate job. They have the responsibility of bringing to justice those responsible for any abuses. It is high time for states to take that responsibility seriously,” said Susanna Flood.

A lot of people told us: “If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear”. The reasoning goes that if you’ve done nothing wrong, it doesn’t matter if governments want to collect all your data, emails, phone calls, webcam images and internet searches, because they won’t find anything of interest. It’s an attractive argument, but it’s not right – and here’s why. 
,  
A lot has been written about this issue, but for answers we looked through the responses of Amnesty supporters on Facebook. We’ve used your comments to explain why “nothing to hide” is the wrong way to respond to governments’ use of mass surveillance. 
,  
,  
Usually, governments conduct targeted surveillance, when they monitor a person or group for specific, legitimate reasons. For this, they’ll need to get permission from a judge, for example to monitor the internet use of someone they suspect of criminal activities. If surveillance is indiscriminate, our communications are being monitored without any reasonable suspicion that we might be doing something dodgy. Governments are treating us all like criminal suspects, and every detail of our personal lives as suspicious. And there are few laws to control what they’re doing. 
,  
,  
You may not think you care about your privacy but the chances are you probably do. Every day we do things in our homes that we wouldn’t do in public. It’s not because we have something to hide, but just that there are parts of our lives we’d rather keep private. John Oliver, host of US TV show Last Week Tonight, asked people in New York how they felt about governments looking at their personal, sexual pictures (although he put it a little more crudely). Unsurprisingly, people feel less comfortable when they think of government agents looking at their most private images. 
,  
,  
Mass surveillance is an unprecedented intrusion into the privacy of ordinary people. At no point in history have we accepted that governments should be able to monitor everything we do to keep us safe. Imagine if we were told they wanted to install cameras in our living rooms, or microphones under tables in coffee shops, to ensure they could catch criminals. This is the physical-world equivalent of online mass surveillance. It’s a huge overreach of government power and we consent to it every time we say we have “nothing to hide”. Instead, we should say to governments: “I have nothing to hide and my private business is none of yours”. 
,  
,  
Much like the right to protest, our privacy is something we notice more when it’s taken away. Throughout history, seemingly innocent information about people has been used to persecute them during moments of crisis. You may trust your current government to look for criminals and not do anything dishonest with your data. But what if it changed and shifted dramatically to the left or the right? In these situations, authorities could gather data to find and crackdown on groups they disagree with. They could use the information to target journalists, persecute activists and discriminate against minorities. 
,  
,  
You may think you have done nothing wrong, but that puts blind faith in the people looking at your data to think the same way. As NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden told us: “These people are looking for criminals. You could be the most innocent person in the world, but if somebody programmed to see patterns of criminality looks at your data, they’re not going to find you – they’re going to find a criminal.” 
,  
,  
Evidence suggests that knowing you are being monitored changes your behaviour. And, as we become more aware of the computer algorithms and databases used to predict criminal activity, we will become more wary of what we say and do online. We will start to avoid saying or doing anything controversial, in case it is misconstrued. As a result, societies will become very conformist, with no-one willing to challenge the status quo. 
,  
,  
In a nutshell, the best response to “I’ve got nothing to hide” will always be: “If I have done nothing wrong, why is my privacy being violated?” 
,  
GET INVOLVED in Amnesty’s work to ban mass surveillance: follow the campaign on Facebook and/or contact Hilary Homes at the national office (hhomes@amnesty.ca). 
,  
, 	Here’s a selection of some of your other responses to the ‘nothing to hide’ debate: 
,  
“Privacy is NOT for hiding, never was; privacy is for protecting, period.” 
, 	Sam Isatlacc 
,  
“Man, you must be living the most inane kind of life possible if you really have nothing to hide from anyone.” 
, 	Mitxel Moriana 
,  
“Just because you’re not doing something wrong doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be allowed privacy.” 
, 	Trilogy Gunby 
,  
“We have a RIGHT to privacy. If someone is suspected of some kind of criminal activity, then a court order for surveillance should be obtained.” 
, 	Amy Rouby 
,  
“When any kind of dissent from the status quo becomes illegal, resistance becomes nearly impossible. As long as you never question anything those in power do, you’ll be safe. Hurray.” 
, 	Roland van der Sluijs 
,  
“Whether you like it or not, we have the right not to be spied on without probable cause.”

,  
As we proudly watched our son Peter Greste finally speak outside the Tora fortress that had been his prison for more than a year, addressing an audience filled with politicians and journalists at the National Press Club in Canberra, our pride couldn’t help be tinged by the knowledge this freedom couldn’t be shared by his Al Jazeera colleagues, Mohamed and Baher. 
,  
These welcoming faces felt a long way from June 2014, when Peter, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, the ‘Al Jazeera three’ as they’d become known, were sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison on charges of broadcasting false news and aiding the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. This nightmare had followed their arrest on the 29th of December, 2013, for simply doing their jobs and was without a doubt the lowest point in the campaign to have all three released. 
,  
Nearly 400 days since their arrest, in late January 2015, the moment we’d been waiting for finally arrived: we received news that Peter was to be deported from Egypt. 
,  
Peter, a dual Australian-Latvian national, and Mohamed Fahmy, a dual Egyptian-Canadian national, had sought deportation under the new Egyptian legislation or presidential decree, allowing the transfer of foreign nationals to their home countries to face trial or serve their sentences in cases of the “highest interest of the state”. By February 1, Peter was on his way home. 
,  
While Peter’s colleagues, Mohamed and Baher were released on February 13 shortly after he was deported from the country, their battle was far from over. Mohamed had to renounce his Egyptian citizenship, hoping the fact he is also a Canadian citizen would mean he would be deported like Peter. Instead, he was asked to deposit about 250,000 Egyptian pounds ($42,000) to be freed on bail, awaiting a retrial. 
,  
The saddest part about this story is not that Baher and Mohamed remain in Egypt, on bail awaiting their retrial today and the chance to prove their innocence. It’s that Peter’s, Baher’s and Mohamed’s cases are not unique. 
,  
As World Press Freedom day approaches on May 3, journalists right around the world are coming under increasing attack for merely doing their jobs. Where once the blue press jacket was a symbol of protection for foreign correspondents and journalists, it has now sadly become a target. 
,  
In Egypt at least 16,000 people have been detained as part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent, with activists estimating that the true figure is much higher. Other journalists and bloggers are facing lengthy jail sentences with a long and unpredictable wait for justice. 
,  
Even in our darkest moments, we were buoyed by the support we received from strangers and friends alike, calling for their immediate release. As it has in the past, we’re hopeful these collective voices will see justice prevail and we can celebrate unconditionally when these men are finally freed. 
,  
If Peter is free, so should his work colleagues Baher and Mohamed. They are part of the same court case, tried together.

Over the past fortnight, hundreds of people are feared to have lost their lives at sea, with more than 10,000 rescued. Many of the survivors have harrowing stories to tell. Here is one, from a Somali boy who lost his friend during a terrifying journey that lasted more than three months in all. Amnesty International spoke to him in a reception centre in Lampedusa, less than a week after his rescue on 17 April. His name has been changed at his request. 
My name is Ali and I come from Somalia. I am 15 years old. 
When I was nine, I was separated from my family and moved to the capital, Mogadishu, where I lived with friends in the Yaaqshiid area. There, I learned English and worked cleaning shoes for soldiers. 
Just over three months ago, I left Somalia. There are lots of problems there – fighting, drought, famine. I’m looking for a better life. I’d like to go to Norway. 
I was travelling with a friend. His father paid for us both to make the trip across the desert from Somalia to Libya. It was long and hard, across several countries in a pick-up truck – Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya. My friend didn’t make it. He fell out of the back of the truck because the people smugglers were driving at high speed across the Sahara. 
The smugglers stopped the car and we checked if he was OK, but he wasn’t. We buried him in the desert. He was 19 years old. When I later called his father to tell him the news, it was a very difficult conversation to have. 
Around three months after leaving Somalia, we arrived in Tripoli. We were there for around a week, in a large house with lots of other people. The people smugglers put Somalis and Eritreans in different houses. Our captors were very bad people; they hit my friends. They also had guns – big ones and pistols. 
The man with the boat asked me for more money to make the trip to Europe – US$1,900. But I had no money or family who could pay. So other people in the house helped me to get enough money to make the trip. 
He lied to us – he told us it would be a fibreglass boat, but it was an inflatable plastic boat. 
Before we left, there was an accident where we were being held in Tripoli. Some of the travellers were cooking with gas, and people were smoking nearby. A gas canister caught fire and exploded, and 10 people died. We buried them in Tripoli. 
Another 22 people, all from Eritrea, had serious injuries – they were completely burnt by the fire. But the smugglers forced them onto the boat anyway. 
We boarded the boat late on 16 April and we left Tripoli at around midnight. There were more than 70 of us – including the badly injured. In all, we were around 45 Somalis, 24 Eritreans, two Bangladeshis and two Ghanaians. 
At around 9 or 9:30 am, the air started going out of the boat. People rushed to the front of the boat to try to put pressure on the hole. We used a satellite phone to call for help. It was six hours before the rescue ship came. 
Those six hours were the worst moments of my life. I thought I would never live again. People were praying out loud, asking God for forgiveness. 
At around 3pm, the rescue ship came – a grey boat from Italy’s Guardia di Finanza. 
I felt like I was born again. 
My friends from the boat are all OK, but the injured were very badly hurt after the journey. One woman from Eritrea died of her burns. Another woman had a two-year-old son but other people on the boat took him because she was seriously injured. So they were split up when we arrived in Lampedusa*. 
Now we have shelter, we have food, we thank God for saving us. And we thank Italy. 
Many are dying. People from Somalia will continue to travel – in my country there is no peace; no work. 
Here in Lampedusa I saw a sign that I liked. It says governments should save lives, not borders. I would like to tell governments to do that.                                                                                                 
* Amnesty International was able to confirm with staff at the Lampedusa reception centre and the director of the local hospital that the injured Eritrean woman and her child were later reunited in Sicily.

This will give youth the opportunity to showcase their talents and passion for human rights, alongside Canada’s top journalists in this field! 
These awards, which have been presented for excellence in journalism and human rights since 1995, honour the efforts of journalists to increase Canadian’s awareness and understanding of a variety of national and international human rights issues. This award will recognize the role Canadian youth plays in the promotion of human rights and it will also highlight the contribution that the young generation has on this conversation. While we often talk about how youth are the leaders of tomorrow, this award recognizes the leaders that youth are today. 
“I guess I was kind of mad. I mean when you feel strongly about something you start to look into it and you start to research it and yeah, that’s how I got around to writing it.” 
-finalist for the Amnesty UK Young Reporter Award 2013 
In pursuit of a vision where every person in the world can enjoy all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards, Amnesty International’s mission is to conduct research and take action to prevent and end grave abuses of all human rights – civil, political, social, cultural and economic. From freedom of expression and association to physical and mental integrity, from protection from discrimination to the right to housing- these rights are indivisible. 
The Youth Media Award includes many ways of covering human rights issues; whether it be printed, broadcasted or posted online, this award allows all submissions as long as they contain a national or international human rights issues, emphasizing how they impact young people. The competition is open to any student at a Canadian university or college who has had an article published or a piece broadcast or posted in a recognized student media outlet during the period from 30 September 2014 through 31 May 2015. To submit a piece of work, you can email it to youth@amnesty.ca by the end of May 2015.

It is easy to lose sight of the number of Canadian judges that have, over the past decade, ruled in favour of Omar Khadr.  It has truly become staggering and includes justices of the Supreme Court of Canada (not once, but twice), the Federal Court of Appeal and Federal Court numerous times, and the Alberta Court of Appeal.  
,  
That said, today’s ruling from the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta is undeniably among the most consequential.  For the first time a judge has ruled squarely on a fundamental right that has been denied Omar Khadr for close to thirteen years, his right to liberty. 
,  
Madam Justice Ross reminds us that “when an applicant’s liberty is at stake, as in this case, the right to seek bail pending appeal is guaranteed under section 7 of the Charter.”  She goes on to find that the evidence before her points to there being a strong prospect of success in the appeal Omar Khadr has launched in the United States, seeking to overturn his conviction by the deeply unfair Military Commission process at Guantánamo Bay. 
,  
She also notes that all of the evidence before her points to Omar Khadr being ‘entirely cooperative’, a ‘model prisoner’ with ‘strong community support’ and a ‘low risk to public safety’.  She highlights, in fact, that the government did not challenge any of that evidence. 
,  
This ruling gets at the heart of the myriad human rights concerns in Omar Khadr’s case.  From 2002 to 2012, held first in Afghanistan and then Guantánamo Bay, Omar Khadr’s rights as a child soldier and juvenile prisoner were ignored and concerns about torture and ill-treatment were disregarded.  He was held for several years without charge and without access to counsel.  He was ultimately tried through proceedings that fell far short of international fair trial requirements.  (I saw that first hand in three visits to Guantánamo Bay to observe those hearings.)  At the end of the day he pleaded guilty and accepted an eight year prison sentence, which he now indicates he felt to be his only way out.  
,  
His appeal in the United States (which will still take some time, perhaps several years, to be heard), considered to have a very strong chance of success based on rulings in similar cases, is his effort to rectify and reverse all of that injustice.  This bail decision rightly concludes that it is fair and lawful that he be given his freedom (subject to conditions yet to be determined) while that is resolved. 
,  
It is disappointing, though not surprising, that the Canadian government immediately announced it would appeal.   That has been the government’s strategy at all stages in Omar Khadr’s case, regardless of whether there are credible legal grounds for doing so.  The fact that the appeal announcement came so quickly after the release of a complex, detailed judgement – grounded in both international and national law – was released, points to this being all about politics, not law.  That was brought home in Public Safety Minister Blaney’s flourish and excess in a public statement highlighting that the appeal reflects the government’s continuing “work to combat the international jihadi movement, which has declared war on Canada and her allies.” 
,  
For the government Omar Khadr’s case has always been about rhetoric, not rights; and about politics, not justice.  Once again, though, a judge has ruled for rights and justice.  And, in the end, that is what must and will prevail.

The tremendous news that three Mexican police officers have been criminally charged with torturing Adrián Vázquez in Tijuana in 2012 is a historic breakthrough; and a great day for justice.  It is obviously very welcome news for Adrián himself; and it can and must spur greater efforts across Mexico to ensure that those who have been responsible for the staggering crisis of torture the country has faced over the past decade are held accountable. 
The charges are truly groundbreaking, the first Amnesty International is aware of in the state of Baja California, where torture is widespread and longstanding.  They follow 2 ½ years of concerted advocacy by his courageous and outspoken wife Judith Luna, and his unrelenting and tenacious lawyer Sandra Esquer; supported by Amnesty International.  Upon hearing the news Sandra expressed just how crucial Amnesty’s campaigning has been. 
Along with Judith, Sandra and other Amnesty colleagues from our Mexican section and our international office, I spent time visiting with Adrián Vázquez in El Hongo Prison outside Tecate, very close to Mexico’s border with the United States, in September 2014.  
By then Adrián had been in custody for nearly two years.  He had been through brutal torture that had very nearly killed him.  We did not know what to expect as we waited for Adrián to be brought in to our meeting room: a broken man, a determined man, an angry man, a sullen man, a man in pain?  We saw a man who was: 
A government doctor said that his injuries were minor and would heal readily.  He then collapsed and had to be rushed to hospital for emergency life-saving surgery. The hospital’s medical reports made it clear that he had many serious injuries, including to his lung, bladder and abdomen, caused by the relentless beatings he had endured. 
Ever since, Adrián has protested that the accusations were false, that his only admissions were to end the torture and that the drugs and weapons had been planted by police. He repeated that forcefully and emotionally during our prison visit.  Sandra Esquer’s diligent investigations have uncovered evidence that has backed up Adrián’s account; that he had not been in a stolen vehicle, was falsely identified as a drug trafficker and that the drugs and weapons were indeed likely planted. The criminal charges against the three police officers certainly back up his account of being tortured. But he remains behind bars. 
So, while this is a great victory, there is still far to go.  The police officers still need to be brought to trial.  There will very likely be further challenges along that path.  Judith and Sandra will continue to watch, press and speak out; as will we. 
Amnesty International’s campaign to StopTorture in Mexico is making a difference.  Angel Colon, a torture survivor who I met behind the bars of a different Mexican prison just a few days before the visit with Adrián, was freed back in October.  We will be welcoming him at our Annual General Meeting in Halifax next month. Claudia Medina, whose campaign for justice for the torture she endured is central to our campaign, has seen the all of the groundless criminal charges she faced  dropped.  And now there are criminal charges against the police officers responsible for torturing Adrián Vázquez. 
The cases remind us that torture is indeed a grim, urgent crisis in Mexico.  The successes make it clear, however, that speaking up and speaking out makes a difference.  Torture can indeed be stopped in Mexico. 
Very critically, though, Adrián Vázquez is not free.  Amnesty International is calling on Mexican authorities to drop the charges against Adrián and release him from prison immediately.  I intend to sit down this afternoon and write Mexico’s Ambassador to Canada with that demand, and follow it up with a meeting. 
Just as I finish off these words I’ve had a message come in from Sandra, Adrián’s remarkable lawyer.  To me, and to Amnesty, she says:  Many thanks.  This would not have happened without Amnesty’s support.  And now we hope ‘señor Adrián’ will be released soon.  We most certainly do.

Samar is also the sister of imprisoned blogger Raif Badawi. 
,  
Words are not enough for me to express how proud I am of my husband. How deeply proud I am of the man who believed in me and my cause when I was imprisoned. As my lawyer, he defended me and never left me alone to face those who unjustly attempted to impose their patriarchal authority over me just because I am a woman who dared to speak up. Everyone turned their backs on me except for my husband who remained by my side until he had helped achieve justice for my cause. 
,  
He has always been my rock whenever I felt weak, he was my strength and my source of motivation and inspiration. 
,  
He taught me that a person is born free and that it is up to him or her to live in freedom or die trying to achieve it. Slavery has no place in his life except when it comes to serving God, the one and only. Now, he lives in freedom even though he is behind bars with his colleagues Abdullah al-Hamid, Mohammad al-Qahtani and many other activists imprisoned purely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. 
,  
My life with him can be described as a wonderful book; resilience is its title, strife and struggle fill its pages, and its conclusion is freedom. 
,  
 
,  
And here I am, my beloved husband, applying what I have learned from the book of our life – for I shall forever be resilient, hanging on whilst you are behind bars. I shall continue my struggle as long as my heart beats, and I shall never give up until I have you back under our roof. I shall forever believe in our freedom which you have spent your whole life defending. 
,  
Know then, dear husband, that it is tyranny and oppression that have put you behind bars. 
,  
In Saudi Arabia those who chose to rule in the name of Islam and Shari’a law have treated such jurisprudence as mere ink on paper. Those who claim to use religion to protect me are the very people who took away my safety and security, for within the kingdom those meant to be serving justice have decided that oppression should be a cause for celebration. 
,  
So a word to them… 
,  
To all those rulers and judges who have unfairly imprisoned the free, and enslaved the people, beware of the judgement you will receive from the heavens above. Woe to you who have terrorized the aggrieved out of pride. 
,  
To my fellow Saudi Arabians I say that my husband has been imprisoned so that you could live free. He stood up to the tyrants to claim your rights; he faced up to his oppressors telling them he would not tolerate their repression. Remember that history does not forget, it will exalt those who have fought for freedom and cast aside the memory of those who succumbed to a life of humiliation and servitude. 
,  
My last words are to my baby daughter, Joud. Do not feel sad because you were born while your father was behind bars. Be proud instead and hold your head high, for the whole world envies you for the father you have – even if his homeland has turned against him. 
,  
The future awaits you to continue your father’s struggle so that you make him even more proud than he is now. You will grow up to be a role model yourself, soon to become known as Joud the free, Joud the defiant, Joud the resilient: Joud Waleed Abu al-Khair”,

But behind the shiny fast cars and super-sized champagne bottles lies a government that is willing to stop at nothing to punish those who dare to speak out about the tragic human rights situation in the country. 
Here are five facts you should know about the Gulf Kingdom ahead of one of the most glamourous events in the sporting calendar. 
 
Demonstrating in the capital, Manama, is forbidden 
Public protests in Bahrain’s capital have been banned for nearly two years. Even outside Manama, security forces frequently use tear gas and birdshot pellets to disperse anyone who dares to demonstrate, often resulting in protesters being injured or even killed. 
Criticizing the authorities on Twitter or other social media sites can land you in jail 
The Bahraini authorities often use broad national security charges such as “inciting hatred against” or “threatening to overthrow the government”, “insulting” the King and other official institutions against activists and others who post comments critical of their policies on social media. 
If authorities don’t like the work of an organization, they can just shut it down 
New laws recently introduced allow the Bahraini government to suspend or shut down any political association for alleged “irregularities” and human rights organizations live under the threat of a restrictive draft NGO law. They have even levelled charges against political activists for meeting with representatives of foreign governments. 
For the many activists who end up in detention, torture is commonplace 
We have documented dozens of cases of detainees being brutally beaten, deprived of sleep and adequate food, burnt with cigarettes, sexually assaulted, electrocuted, including on the genitals, and burnt with an iron to try and force them to “confess” to crimes. One such detainee told us he was struck with the claw of a hammer on several parts of his body. Another said he was raped by having a plastic pipe inserted into his anus. 
These shocking abuses are very rarely or adequately investigated. 
And if none of that works, the government will just revoke someone’s nationality 
Authorities in Bahrain usually resort to revoking the nationality of people considered to be a government opponent. Without nationality, individuals are forced to leave the country, even if they have nowhere else to go. Many of those whose nationality was revoked were rendered effectively stateless.

Raif Badawi was jailed in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and sentenced to 1,000 lashes last year after setting up a website for social and political debate. When he received the first 50 lashes in January, campaigners across the world united in outrage. His flogging has not been carried out since for unknown reasons, but he is still not free and at risk of being flogged again as long as his sentence stands. “To you, free people still standing up for Raif, your protests are making a difference,” said his wife Ensaf Haidar. “Please do not stop until Raif is released.”  Sign now

Thanks to the hard work of dedicated activists in El Salvador, Carmen Guadalupe Vasquez was finally pardoned and walked free from prison in February. She was just 18 when she suffered a miscarriage. Suspected of having an abortion – banned in all cases in El Salvador – she was jailed for 30 years in 2007 on trumped-up murder charges.

Raif Badawi was jailed in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and sentenced to 1,000 lashes last year after setting up a website for social and political debate. When he received the first 50 lashes in January, campaigners across the world united in outrage. His flogging has not been carried out since for unknown reasons, but he is still not free and at risk of being flogged again as long as his sentence stands. “To you, free people still standing up for Raif, your protests are making a difference,” said his wife Ensaf Haidar. “Please do not stop until Raif is released.”  Sign now 
  
 
After years of campaigning, we helped bring about justice for 15,600 farmers and fishermen in Bodo, a community in the Niger Delta region. In January, Shell announced a £55m settlement to help rebuild the lives and livelihoods devastated by two large oil spills in 2008 and 2009. The fight for an environmental clean-up goes on.

Last month, federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt disclosed previously unreleased RCMP statistics about the numbers of murders committed by Indigenous men. The Minister appears to believe that these figures support the federal government’s current approach to the issue, including the ongoing refusal to hold a public inquiry or initiate a comprehensive, coordinated national action plan. 
,  
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
,  
Responding to the letter from Commission Paulson, Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC), stated, “We are absolutely shocked and appalled that the RCMP would hastily release these serious statistics without providing a full, publicly accessible report detailing how they are collecting and compiling this information.” 
,  
The police and government response to the issue of violence against Indigenous women and girls was previously framed around the notion of ‘high risk lifestyles’—effectively a vague and sweeping code phrase encompassing poverty, addiction issues, sex work, and hitchhiking. The issue has now been re-cast as domestic violence within the Indigenous community, and publicly available statistics have been misinterpreted and manipulated to fit this framing. Neither framing comprehensively captures the diversity and complexity of the experiences of Indigenous women and girls. 
,  
Canadians need accurate and comprehensive statistics on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls to ensure that the rights steps are being taken to address threats and ensure the safety of all women and girls. 
,  
 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
Governments have a fundamental obligation to do everything in their power not only to ensure that attacks on women and girls are fully investigated and those responsible brought to justice, but also to  address the social and economic factors putting women and girls at risk. 
,  
Until last year, there were no official, national police statistics on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls—which is, in itself, an indication of the failure of police and government to do all they can to ensure their safety. 
,  
Last year, when the RCMP attempted to compile its first report on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, it had to deal with the fact that police homicide reports often record the ethnic identity of victims as “unknown.” While the RCMP claim to have successfully resolved the Indigenous identity of the majority of homicides through coordination with the original reporting police forces, they acknowledge that there are no standards or training for police on how to record this information accurately and that police may simply guess or record Indigenous identity based on whether the individual “looks Aboriginal” to them. 
,  
All of this raises questions about the accuracy of the RCMP data. But even taking the data at face value, the information released to date demonstrates a clear need for urgent, concerted action. 
,  
,  
According to the 2014 RCMP report, at least 1,017 Indigenous women and girls were murdered between 1980 and 2012. This is in addition to 105 Indigenous women and girls who were recorded as missing under suspicious circumstances or for undetermined reasons. Furthermore, these figures entirely leave out the large numbers of unresolved, suspicious deaths not covered by the RCMP report. There are serious, well documented concerns over the adequacy of police investigations when family members have concerns but there is no direct evidence of foul play. Such cases continue to be excluded from the discourse. 
,  
Each of these deaths and disappearances should be cause for concern. The need for action is even more apparent when the numbers of murders of Indigenous women and girls is compared to the overall low homicide rate in Canada. In the decade covered by the RCMP report—the period during which the figures are likely to be most accurate—the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was roughly 7 times higher for Indigenous women and girls than for all other women and girls in Canada. 
,  
,  
Like other acts of violence against women in Canada, most recorded murders of Indigenous women and girls were committed by an intimate partner or family member. Government officials have focused on the figure that 62% percent of murders of Indigenous women and girls reported by the RCMP were acts of domestic violence. What has been ignored is that the fact that this is actually a significantly lower percentage than in the general population. 
,  
According to the RCMP, 74% of murders of non-Aboriginal women are committed by intimate partners and family members. The difference is largely accounted for by a much higher rate of attacks on Indigenous women and girls by individuals outside the family, but still known to the victims—including neighbours, employers and what the police refer to as “authority figures.” In the 22 year period covered by the RCMP, acquaintances were found to be responsible for the murder of more than 300 Indigenous women and girls in Canada. This statistic has largely been ignored by government spokespersons. 
,  
Also ignored is the unusually high rate of violence by strangers. Attacks by strangers account for only a small percentage of acts of violence against women and girls, whether the victims are Indigenous or non-Indigenous. But in the case of Indigenous women, while attacks by strangers account for less than 10 percent of homicides, the numbers of such attacks should still be cause for concern. The 2014 RCMP report found that strangers were responsible for the murder of at least 81 Indigenous women and girls. 
,  
,  
Over the last week, there has been considerable attention to the claim, now backed up by a letter from the RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, that 70% of murders of Indigenous women and girls were committed by people—mostly men—who are themselves Indigenous. 
,  
Although this figure had been shared with the government, Commissioner Paulson said that until the Aboriginal Affairs Minister chose to quote the figure, the RCMP had decided not to release the statistic to the public both out of concern not to “stigmatize and marginalize vulnerable populations” and because, in the RCMP’s assessment, the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator is what’s relevant, not the ethnicity of the perpetrator. 
,  
Despite the stated concern about stigmatizing and marginalizing vulnerable populations, Commissioner Paulson’s letter does not provide comparative figures for other segments of the population. 
,  
It’s generally understood that the majority of acts of violence against women and girls are committed by someone from the same ethnic group or background. As many commentators have pointed out, the unique significance that the government is attaching to the Indigenous identity of many of the perpetrators of violence against Indigenous women and girls is part of a wider social narrative that places the responsibility for violence  against Indigenous women and girls solely on Indigenous communities themselves. 
,  
This narrative ignores the other side of the coin: that the same RCMP statistics would suggest that non-Indigenous people are responsible for the murder of more than 200 Indigenous women since 1980. It also ignores the role of discrimination and marginalization in fuelling attacks on Indigenous women and girls, whether by Indigenous or non-Indigenous perpetrators, in pushing Indigenous women into situations of heightened risk of violence, or in denying them adequate supports to escape violence. 
,  
,  
The extremely high levels of violence facing Indigenous women and girls, and the pervasiveness of this violence, require urgent, concerted action. Two recent reports from international human rights bodies—the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights—set out a clear case that current actions being undertaken by the federal, provincial and territorial governments fall far short of what is required to ensure the safety of First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls. Governments in Canada must stop making excuses and instead make the safety of Indigenous women and girls a genuine priority, backed up by resources and commitments consistent with the seriousness of this human rights crisis. 
,  
Amnesty International has long called for systematic collection and public reporting of police data on the ethnic identity of victims of violent crime as well as the perpetrators. We believe that failure to do so makes it more likely that bias and racist assumptions will be relied on in place of hard facts.  It’s clear, however, that this information needs to be handled carefully and respectfully. Police should work with Indigenous peoples’ organizations and others to develop appropriate protocols and training for collecting and sharing this data. And crucially, the interpretation of what this data means, and the action required, needs to be taken outside the political arena. This is why an independent public inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls remains vitally important. 
,  
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the UBCIC, stated, “The RCMP’s piece-meal, sporadic, and dangerously racializing report highlights the urgent need for a national inquiry where this report can be properly evaluated and verified.”

,  
Adoption of Bill C-641 would commit Parliament to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent” with the UN Declaration. 
,  
The Declaration, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007, consolidates existing international human rights protections into a framework of minimum standards for the “survival, dignity and well-being” of Indigenous peoples around the world. 
,  
In Amnesty International’s view, the Declaration is consistent with the overall direction taken by Canadian courts in their interpretation of the Constitutionally-protected rights of First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. In fact, Canadian courts have already used the Declaration to help interpret Canadian laws such as the Canadian Human Rights Act. Using the Declaration as a guide in the legislative process would help avoid many of the onerous and unfair court battles currently forced on Indigenous peoples seeking legal recognition and protection of their rights. 
,  
Unfortunately — despite publicly endorsing the Declaration in 2010 and joining international consensus statements committing to its implementation — the federal government has strongly rejected calls to ensure that new and existing laws and regulations live up to the standards set out in the Declaration. 
,  
Responding to Bill C-641, Mark Strahl, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, claimed that accepting an obligation to implement the Declaration would have “the potential to cripple our economy.” Strahl stated, “While we acknowledge and uphold aboriginal rights, our government understands… that these rights must be balanced against the rights of other Canadians.” 
,  
West Vancouver MP John Weston was more explicit, characterizing the Declaration as creating “separate, opposed rights” for “a select few”. 
,  
These statements are not only misleading and inaccurate, they directly play on the very social divisions that government MPs claim to oppose. It’s hard to imagine internationally recognized human rights standards for any other group being described as a threat to “the rights of other Canadians.” 
,  
In fact, the Declaration does not create new or special rights. Instead it sets out minimum standards to ensure that existing rights are upheld without discrimination and are applied in a way that addresses the particular needs and circumstances of Indigenous peoples. Like other international instruments,  the Declaration is intended to provide guidance in reforming laws that are discriminatory and ensuring that new laws are consistent with international human rights principles. 
,  
Such guidance is particularly important with in respect to the situation of Indigenous peoples, where there is an urgent need to finally address the ongoing harm caused by past violations and to eradicate the legacy of colonialism that remains entrenched in too many government laws and policies. 
,  
Federal government spokespersons have been particularly critical of provisions in the Declaration that call for the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples on decisions affecting their rights. Mark Strahl characterized FPIC as “a veto over any sort of legislation or development that concerns them.” 
,  
Contrary to the extreme stand taken by the government, the FPIC standard is already widely established in international law, and has been accepted as part of the basic code of conduct of many international industry associations, investor groups, and bodies like the International Finance Corporation. Last year, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in its decision on Tsilhqot’in land rights that, as a starting position, government and industry should assume that decisions affecting lands owned by Indigenous peoples may require their consent. 
,  
Critically, the requirement to obtain consent has not been described as a “veto” in any of these instances. 
,  
The scenarios described by the federal government in which Indigenous peoples would use the Declaration to somehow exercise absolute, unilateral power is not only unrealistic, but also flies in the face of a clear history of FPIC of being understood, like almost all other rights, as requiring a balanced and objective case-by-case assessment of all the rights at stake, including those of non-Indigenous peoples. 
,  
In fact, the Declaration itself has extensive, overarching balancing provisions – which Canada helped draft – that clearly state that its standards must be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the goal of respecting the human rights of all. 
,  
The alternative to FPIC is for governments to continue to impose their will on Indigenous peoples, regardless of the consequences. This would not be consistent with the Canadian legal traditions the government claims to uphold, including the history of treaty making. Nor is it in the interests of Canada as a whole to continue to marginalize and impoverish Indigenous peoples by denying them the power to make their own decisions about their lives and futures. 
,  
Adoption of Bill C-641 provides an opportunity for the Canadian Parliament set its relationship with Indigenous peoples on a foundation of respect for human rights and the rule of law. It’s also an opportunity set a positive example for other countries where Indigenous peoples often face horrendous threats, violence and repression simply for identifying as Indigenous.

Instead it sets out minimum standards to ensure that existing rights are upheld without discrimination and are applied in a way that addresses the particular needs and circumstances of Indigenous peoples. Like other international instruments,  the Declaration is intended to provide guidance in reforming laws that are discriminatory and ensuring that new laws are consistent with international human rights principles. 
Such guidance is particularly important with in respect to the situation of Indigenous peoples, where there is an urgent need to finally address the ongoing harm caused by past violations and to eradicate the legacy of colonialism that remains entrenched in too many government laws and policies. 
Federal government spokespersons have been particularly critical of provisions in the Declaration that call for the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples on decisions affecting their rights. Mark Strahl characterized FPIC as “a veto over any sort of legislation or development that concerns them.” 
Contrary to the extreme stand taken by the government, the FPIC standard is already widely established in international law, and has been accepted as part of the basic code of conduct of many international industry associations, investor groups, and bodies like the International Finance Corporation. Last year, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in its decision on Tsilhqot’in land rights that, as a starting position, government and industry should assume that decisions affecting lands owned by Indigenous peoples may require their consent. 
Critically, the requirement to obtain consent has not been described as a “veto” in any of these instances. 
The scenarios described by the federal government in which Indigenous peoples would use the Declaration to somehow exercise absolute, unilateral power is not only unrealistic, but also flies in the face of a clear history of FPIC of being understood, like almost all other rights, as requiring a balanced and objective case-by-case assessment of all the rights at stake, including those of non-Indigenous peoples. 
In fact, the Declaration itself has extensive, overarching balancing provisions – which Canada helped draft – that clearly state that its standards must be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the goal of respecting the human rights of all. 
The alternative to FPIC is for governments to continue to impose their will on Indigenous peoples, regardless of the consequences. This would not be consistent with the Canadian legal traditions the government claims to uphold, including the history of treaty making. Nor is it in the interests of Canada as a whole to continue to marginalize and impoverish Indigenous peoples by denying them the power to make their own decisions about their lives and futures. 
Adoption of Bill C-641 provides an opportunity for the Canadian Parliament set its relationship with Indigenous peoples on a foundation of respect for human rights and the rule of law. It’s also an opportunity set a positive example for other countries where Indigenous peoples often face horrendous threats, violence and repression simply for identifying as Indigenous. 
Bill C-641 was introduced in the House of Commons by Romeo Saganash, the MP for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou.

,  
On June 17, 2012, my husband, Raif Badawi, the father of my three children and my best friend, was arrested in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. For nearly three years, as he has languished in prison, my family has been trapped in a nightmare. 
,  
Raif is a man of principle and a respected activist in Saudi Arabia. In 2008, he started a blog where readers could openly discuss politics, religion and other social issues. But in Saudi Arabia, one can pay an unthinkable price simply for blogging. Raif was convicted of insulting Islam and violating the kingdom’s repressive information-technology laws. 
,  
Then this January, in a show of cruelty, the authorities lashed Raif 50 times. He still faces 950 more lashes and seven more years in prison. I didn’t think there could be anything worse than watching a shaky cellphone video of my husband being publicly beaten in front of a mosque thousands of miles away. But recently I learned of efforts to retry Raif on a charge of apostasy — that he has abandoned or renounced Islam. This information chilled me to my core because, under Saudi law, such a charge is punishable by death — usually by beheading.

If the court finds my husband guilty, I fear we will never see him again. How will my children grow up without their father?….(read more)

So the UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told a meeting of national security and intelligence professionals last month. 
,  
He was wrong. In fact, the debate is only beginning. 
,  
Just two days after Hammond’s speech, the UK Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee released a report which concluded that British laws governing intelligence agencies and mass surveillance require a complete overhaul to make them more transparent and understandable. Amnesty International called the country’s regulation of government surveillance “an inadequate mess”. 
,  
This is not mere rhetoric. The organization is in the process of bringing fresh legal action against both the UK and US governments to challenge their use of indiscriminate mass surveillance programmes to hoover up our communications – emails, calls, internet searches, contact lists, phone locations, webcam images and more – on an unprecedented scale. 
,  
Both these challenges proceed from the basis that such programmes constitute a fundamental breach of the human rights to privacy and freedom of expression. As far as human rights organizations are concerned, the surveillance of their confidential communications with their contacts also has grave implications for their ability to carry out their day-to-day work. 
,  
Conversation piece 
,  
Digital rights experts say that the debate over these issues – not just with governments, but with the powerful tech giants behind the internet – will be crucial to ensure that the online world remains a place where rights are protected. 
,  
One of these growing number of voices in the wilderness is Andrew Puddephatt, Executive Director of Global Partners Digital. An expert on freedom of expression policy and practice for decades, he has focused extensively on digital rights. National governments, as well as intergovernmental organizations such as the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth, UNDP and UNESCO, have sought his advice. 
,  
 
,  
According to Puddephatt, those fighting to ensure the right to privacy is respected online are “stuck between Scylla and Charybdis” – facing off against restrictive governments on the one hand and profit-seeking corporations on the other. But he is adamant that the dialogue needs to continue – not only with national governments, but also with the private sector. 
,  
“I think we need to be talking to the companies who are at the forefront of innovation, not in an antagonistic way, but just to say it’s just useful for us to understand where you’re going with the technology. To have … a conversation, about any potential human rights implications that we see,” said Puddephatt. 
,  
Massive transformation 
,  
When it was founded, the internet was seen as a space where free speech and open debate could flourish. Today, that vision is under attack. And the human rights implications are far-ranging. 
,  
“There is massive transformation going on all around us, but we’re like rabbits in the headlights,” Puddephatt warned. 
,  
he internet and the ever-expanding range of new applications it hosts – social media networks, video-sharing platforms and the like – have revolutionized the way people communicate. As mobile devices gradually take the place of desktop computers, the impact of such changes will become even more pronounced. 
,  
This scenario has broken down traditional hierarchies and power structures, said Puddephatt. It has, in his terms, “democratized” freedom of expression – giving rise to a series of changes as transformational as those inspired by the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. 
,  
Digital rights under attack 
,  
In the past, governments sought to control the actual content of communications themselves. They could censor individual texts or publications, or remove the people responsible for them, either through detention, disappearance or death. Surveillance was a matter of physically snooping around or tapping into individual phone lines or networks. 
,  
But the very way the internet is built – an interconnected series of protocols – now allows governments to interfere with how entire populations can access the means to publish and share information. This is already happening – for example when China blocks access to the websites of certain news or human rights organizations. 
,  
The popularity of social networks like Twitter and video platforms like YouTube also means that governments can severely restrict the space for sharing and publishing ideas by targeting just a few internet platforms – as Turkey has in the past. 
,  
On a much deeper level, though, some governments have developed tools to tap into the physical infrastructure of the internet and indiscriminately scoop up massive amounts of private data about people’s communications and whereabouts. 
,  
These types of mass surveillance programmes – practiced by the USA and the UK among others – were the focus of Edward Snowden’s shocking revelations in June 2013. 
,  
The scale and pace of change 
,  
But this is just the tip of the iceberg, warned Puddephatt. He said the private sector is now doing “10 times” more surveillance than governments. For them, harvesting and storing massive amounts of personal data isn’t something that’s done in the shadows – it’s actually part of their business model. A key challenge for human rights organizations will be to keep up with the frenetic pace of technological innovations and their huge implications for the right to privacy and other human rights. 
,  
According to Puddephatt, even the cutting edge groups doing digital rights advocacy are only now catching up to and responding to transformations that have already taken place. 
,  
He said few organizations have even considered the massive human rights implications of tomorrow’s technologies that are already in research and development. Innovations already being rolled out or on the near horizon include 3D printing, wearable technology, artificial intelligence and the “internet of things” – a digital network of everyday objects and devices and connected to and communicating with each other. 
,  
A call to action 
,  
As part of the response to these growing concerns, Amnesty International is expanding its work on technology and human rights. The organization has just launched #UnfollowMe, a global campaign against indiscriminate mass surveillance, to challenge governments that want to invade privacy and restrict freedoms on an industrial scale.

Mohamed’s sister, Hanaa, is incredibly anxious about what the future might hold for her family. Below is a harrowing letter she wrote to her brother: 
,  
Dear Mohamed, 
,  
I’m often asked why, and how, you’ve kept up your hunger strike for 14 months now, despite our pleas for you to end it. I’ve watched your body go from a plump basketball-playing frame to one that has withered down to its bones. Your face, with its beautiful smile often grinning, now looks permanently in pain. And, all I can do to explain is to tell people that it’s the only form of control you have to hold on to – now more than ever, on the eve of your sentencing. 
,  
Last month, our father was sentenced to death in the same case in which you are due to be sentenced in tomorrow. We weren’t expecting it. I was told by the lawyers to expect a few years at most. I still have not recovered from the trauma of this. 
,  
On 26 January 2014, you began your hunger strike to help regain some form of control, which you had been completely stripped of. You had been in jail for five months by then and said you had grown tired of complaining about receiving no medical care for both a potentially fatal pre-existing blood clot disorder, as well as the torture and ill-treatment you were subjected to when you were detained. 
,  
You described how officers used chains to beat your arm, where you still had stiches for a gunshot wound you received during the dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in by Egyptian security forces on 14 August 2013. The beatings caused the stiches to open, leaving you susceptible to all kinds of dangerous infections. The beatings also caused the metal pins and plates in your arm to shift, cutting against nerves and muscles, causing great pain, for which you were allowed no medication or treatment. You could not even get X-rays done. A doctor cellmate undertook ad hoc surgery using pliers and a razor with no anaesthesia or sterilization. You told President Barack Obama of this horror in a letter in November of 2013. He has yet to reply. 
,  
We have been so worried about you that we recently pressured you to consume liquids, because of your solitary confinement for 23 and a half hours a day and lack of medical care at Leiman Tora Prison. Nevertheless, you hang on to the strike, because it is the only thing you can change and choose. You would have suffered a mental breakdown otherwise. I understand. 
,  
Your frail body belies a strong mind. I know you’ve grown very spiritual throughout this whole process. You read every novel and book that we send, multiple times over. At times, the prison guards would prevent any new reading material coming into your cell, and it’s at these times when you’re most vulnerable to losing your grip. Reading and the hunger strike have been your main coping mechanisms. For us, choosing and sending you books has been one way to cope too. 
,  
For that half hour that you’re allowed out from the cell, you try to get your blood flowing through basic physical therapy. Your legs have become too weak to stand or walk. I imagine you also engage frequently with the guards and others. You’re an incredibly social human being, and need to be around others. I imagine you using that half hour to get some much-needed human contact. 
,  
Knowing that your fate is in the hands of a judge who has sentenced our father to death does not help calm my nerves. I am very anxious. Throughout this 19-month ordeal, I have seen so much of humanity lost, but I have also been amazed at the good that exists in people the world over, and the power of our unity in humanity. It has many faces, and I am grateful for every single one. Mohamed, you are blessed in many ways to have your story reach so many.

,  
The long-awaited fifth season of Game of Thrones begins on Sunday, April 12. Broadcast in 170 countries, the show shocks viewers and generates controversy with graphic violence, especially against women. 
,  
Yet many aspects of real life around the world today are WORSE than the mythical Game of Thrones world of Westeros. 
,  
[spoiler alert: reveals plot lines up to the end of season 2] 
,  
,  
Game of Thrones begins with Northern Lord Ned Stark executing a deserter. Since no character is safe in the show, he is then beheaded by the despotic King Joffrey seven episodes later. Despite several executions, Westeros pales in comparison with the 2,466 death sentences Amnesty International reported worldwide in 2014, up 28% on 2013. 
,  
 
,  
This sharp rise is driven largely by Egypt and Nigeria, though the greatest number of executions happen in China. Methods of execution around the world include lethal injection and hanging, while beheading still happens in Saudi Arabia. 
,  
Read Amnesty International’s 2014 Death Penalty report. 
,  
,  
Most examples of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment on Game of Thrones could have been inspired by real life. In 2014 Amnesty International documented various torture practices reminiscent of the Theon Greyjoy torture scenes throughout season two: the removal of nails (in Nigeria), mock executions (Mexico), or stripping victims naked and tying and pulling their genitalia with a string (The Philippines). 
,  
 
,  
In 2014 Amnesty International warned of a global crisis of torture. It has reported on torture and other ill-treatment in 141 countries over the past five years, from beatings and rape to the use of dogs to intimidate victims. 
,  
The show’s torture scenes may have touched a nerve. 44% of people still fear they would be at risk of torture if taken into custody in their country, according to an Amnesty survey. 
,  
Find out more about Amnesty International’s Stop Torture campaign. 
,  
,  
Game of Thrones is criticized for its depiction of women and sexual violence. Women are raped, forced into sexual slavery or subjected to other gender-based violence. 
,  
Several of the main protagonists find themselves sold or forced into marriage. In the very first episode, Daenerys Targaryen’s brother forces her into marriage to further his own ambitions. 
,  
 
,  
	Women’s rights fare little better in the real world. Violence against women continues to be a feature of violent conflicts, but not limited to them. In Algeria and Tunisia, legislation allows a man accused of rape to avoid prosecution by marrying the girl he raped – if she is under 18. 
,  
We do not know the true scale of forced marriage, but GirlsNotBrides says 700 million women alive today were married before turning 18. One country where forced marriage continues is Somalia, although the precise extent is unknown.

The long-awaited fifth season of Game of Thrones begins on Sunday, April 12. Broadcast in 170 countries, the show shocks viewers and generates controversy with graphic violence, especially against women. 
Yet many aspects of real life around the world today are WORSE than the mythical Game of Thrones world of Westeros. 
[spoiler alert: reveals plot lines up to the end of season 2] 
Game of Thrones begins with Northern Lord Ned Stark executing a deserter. Since no character is safe in the show, he is then beheaded by the despotic King Joffrey seven episodes later. Despite several executions, Westeros pales in comparison with the 2,466 death sentences Amnesty International reported worldwide in 2014, up 28% on 2013. 
 
This sharp rise is driven largely by Egypt and Nigeria, though the greatest number of executions happen in China. Methods of execution around the world include lethal injection and hanging, while beheading still happens in Saudi Arabia. 
Read Amnesty International’s 2014 Death Penalty report. 
Most examples of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment on Game of Thrones could have been inspired by real life. In 2014 Amnesty International documented various torture practices reminiscent of the Theon Greyjoy torture scenes throughout season two: the removal of nails (in Nigeria), mock executions (Mexico), or stripping victims naked and tying and pulling their genitalia with a string (The Philippines). 
 
In 2014 Amnesty International warned of a global crisis of torture. It has reported on torture and other ill-treatment in 141 countries over the past five years, from beatings and rape to the use of dogs to intimidate victims. 
The show’s torture scenes may have touched a nerve. 44% of people still fear they would be at risk of torture if taken into custody in their country, according to an Amnesty survey. 
Find out more about Amnesty International’s Stop Torture campaign. 
Game of Thrones is criticized for its depiction of women and sexual violence. Women are raped, forced into sexual slavery or subjected to other gender-based violence. 
Several of the main protagonists find themselves sold or forced into marriage. In the very first episode, Daenerys Targaryen’s brother forces her into marriage to further his own ambitions. 
 
	Women’s rights fare little better in the real world. Violence against women continues to be a feature of violent conflicts, but not limited to them. In Algeria and Tunisia, legislation allows a man accused of rape to avoid prosecution by marrying the girl he raped – if she is under 18. 
We do not know the true scale of forced marriage, but GirlsNotBrides says 700 million women alive today were married before turning 18. One country where forced marriage continues is Somalia, although the precise extent is unknown. In March, Amnesty International published chilling testimonies of Somalian women and girls with disabilities forced to marry older and/or abusive men: 
“I was 13 years old. My family decided to give me to this man, I refused and ran away. My family sent strong men after me. They caught me, tied my arms and legs and threw me in a room with the man. He beat me since the beginning.”

Across the world, Amnesty campaigners are doing all they can to fight for his release. 
“You taught me the importance of trying to change things that look unjust,” Christian, Canada. 
For the past two weeks, I’ve read and counted around 4,000 beautiful cards and letters for human rights lawyer and law professor Dr Mohammed al-Roken. He was sentenced to 10 years’ prison in the UAE after a deeply unfair mass trial of 94 government critics and activists, and has spent much of the last 1,000 days in a high security prison in the Abu Dhabi desert. 
Just some of the thousands of cards sent in support of Mohammed al-Roken as part of Write for Rights 2015. 
The cards represent just a small fraction of the incredible 100,000 people who pressed for Dr al-Roken’s release as part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign last December. I wish he and his family could read all the messages for him, and gain strength and courage knowing that they’re not alone. Sadly, it’s not safe to send them anything due to possible risks and because families of prisoners of conscience in the UAE are under incredible pressure from the authorities to stay silent. 
 
Many UAE nationals were shocked when Dr al-Roken, from Dubai, was sent to jail. But they are afraid to speak up because nobody wants the same fate. No one wants to be arrested, locked up alone for months, and jailed for 10 years. People are even scared to speak to Amnesty. I am writing this blog very carefully to avoid placing anyone at risk of arrest or harassment. 
That’s why I’m so grateful to everyone who has taken action for Dr al-Roken. It’s very difficult to campaign on the UAE, as it often gets drowned out by bigger countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia. But it’s certainly no less repressive towards dissent. 
“I’m writing to you today because I can’t stay indifferent towards injustice and lack of freedom.”	Zlata, 12, Canada 
Equally, it’s easy to be blinded by the impressive skyscrapers, shopping and beaches of the UAE. But behind the facade are a large number of activists and their families who have been silenced in the last few years after calling for democratic reform and greater rights and freedoms. 
I know many people who have met Dr al-Roken and they all have nothing but respect and praise for him. All the messages I’ve read express shock and sadness, but also admiration for the strength he has shown in doing something that few people have the courage to do. He was passionate about defending human rights in the UAE, even though he could have avoided years of harassment, travel bans, surveillance and imprisonment had he chosen to follow an easier path. 
Just one of the 4,000 cards and letters supporting Mohammed al-Roken. 
We have not had any response from the UAE government but I know they are aware of our campaign and will be reading this blog. I do hope the situation there improves. It’s a great country and its leaders have achieved much since it was founded in 1971. But part of being a progressive nation is the ability to respect and protect human rights, rather than cage the people who call for them. 
My hope for Dr al-Roken and other activists imprisoned alongside him is that they will be immediately and unconditionally released. I hope that Dr al-Roken’s licence to practice law is reinstated so that he can continue his noble work as a lawyer and that he will once again be allowed to give lectures as a law professor. 
My message to Dr al-Roken and his family on his 1,000th day in prison is that your plight is known around the world. We will keep fighting for you until you are free. 
In the words of Donne from the Netherlands: “The world is blessed to have people like you. I hope to achieve your level of courage someday. You inspire me every day.”

Afghanistan is a dangerous place. It’s particularly dangerous for women, who all too often experience threats and violence simply because of their gender. Women in the public sphere, whether they are doctors, engineers, police officers, or politicians, are seen as stepping outside of social, cultural, and religious norms and are at particular risk. And the courageous women and men who take a stand to defend women’s human rights are at perhaps the greatest risk. The story of women human rights defenders in Afghanistan is a story of hope, courage, and resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy. 
,  
,  
 
,  
While overall civilian casualties in Afghanistan are decreasing, women casualties have gone up dramatically. Despite strong laws and policies protecting women from violence and discrimination, they remain largely unimplemented. 
,  
Women are under threat from the Taliban and other insurgents, from government authorities, powerful commanders and warlords and even their own families. 
,  
 
,  
And in this climate of fear and violence, women continue to put their lives on the line to work in the public sphere and to defend human rights. They receive death threats, face assassination attempts, and worse. And still they continue their work. 
,  
This the story of Senator Rohgul Khairkhwah, one of the many courageous women in Afghanistan who bravely forges on despite the risks. Her story and the stories of other women human rights defenders in Afghanistan are profiled in “On their own: Women human rights defenders at risk in Afghanistan,” a new report published by Amnesty International.

“Anti-government groups are targeting prominent and outspoken women’s rights advocates [in order to] spread fear among other women’s rights activists [and] stop their activities.” – Senator Rohgul Khairkhwah 
,  
Rohgul Khairkhwah is the Senator for Nimroz province in southern Afghanistan. On August 4, 2013, two days before the Muslim festival of Eid, as she was driving through Ghazni province on her way home, the Taliban attacked the vehicle she was travelling in. With her in the car were her husband and their three children, her brother and his three children. The Senator’s seven-year old daughter and brother were killed in the attack. Her other daughter, who was 11 at the time, became paralyzed as a result of her injuries. The Senator was shot nine times, with wounds to her liver and lung, and in one leg. She also lost a finger, and three others are now paralyzed. She spent the next two months in hospital recuperating from her injuries. 
, 	Despite her ordeal, Senator Khairkhwah returned to work after she was discharged. Given what she has suffered, people did not expect her to resume her position in the Senate, but as she told Amnesty International: “I want to motivate other women to continue their work.” 
,  
Senator Khairkhwah continues to represent the people of Nimroz despite the threatening phone calls and texts she receives. After the attempt on her life, the Senator had both her telephone number and handset changed but a few months after that the threats resumed. She estimates that she has received more than 100 threats since 2010. 
,  
Since the threats first began, Senator Khairkhwah has kept Afghanistan’s intelligence service and other government agencies informed of the threats against her, but the official response has been negligible. When the threats first began, she was told that that they were merely “designed to create a climate of fear” because of the peace consultations at which she was a delegate. Two years later, Senator Khairkhwah still has no answer as to who is responsible for the murder of her daughter and brother. 
,  
,  
While Senator Kharikhwah’s story may be all too familiar in Afghanistan, it is almost unimaginable in Canada. If you had been shot because of your work, if you had received death threats, if family members had lost their lives because of your work, what would you do? Would you continue to speak out? Would you go into hiding? Would you try to leave the country?

For 600 days Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, a 27-year-old Egyptian photojournalist, has been holed up in a small cell in the infamous Tora prison. His crime: taking pictures of the violent dispersal of the Rabaa al-Adaweya sit-in in August 2013. He is one of dozens of Egyptian journalists arrested since former President Mohamed Morsi was ousted on 3 July 2013. Six have been killed since then. 
,  
Here’s a harrowing letter that Mahmoud Abou Zeid sent from his cell: 
,  
“My life changed forever on the morning of Wednesday 14 August 2013. I was taking pictures of people protesting on the streets of Cairo when police came and locked down the streets. Thousands of people were immediately arrested – not only Morsi supporters, but also dozens of people caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
,  
It was like a Hollywood movie. It felt like we were in the middle of a war. There were bullets, tear gas, fire, police, soldiers and tanks everywhere. I saw how armed police took over the Square. After identifying myself to the police as a photojournalist, I was arrested along with fellow freelance French photojournalist Louis Jammes and American journalist Mike Giglio. 
,  
The Mokhbers (low-ranking police that doesn’t have uniforms) tied our hands behind our backs with a plastic ligature that is used in wars. I was beaten by two men. They used closed fists and even my own belt. They stole my camera, my mobile phone, my watch and all of my personal belongings. Then, they put us and several protesters in a car and took us to Cairo Stadium. 
,  
“I thought I was going to die” 
, 	Our group was then divided. Jammes and Giglio were released after just two hours. Those of us remaining were kept at the Cairo Stadium for the rest of the day and were transferred to a police station later. My hands were still tied behind my back — my wrists bleeding from the tightness of the plastic ligature. I can still see the scars. 
,  
At the police station, I continued to be treated like a criminal. 
,  
I was put in a very small cell with other 39 prisoners. The cell was very hot with all 40 of us in it. I had no place to sit and it was impossible to breathe. There was no ventilation. I was not given anything to eat or drink during the three days I was held. 
,  
The police officers were telling each other how to beat and torture us to cause more pain and harm. I was very afraid and thought I was going to die. Each hour they came and continued to beat me with all kinds of things. These were easily the worst days of my life. It even hurts me to remember them. 
,  
Five officers beat me at the same time with a belt and their fists, and kicked me with their boots. I dropped to the floor but they did not stop. I tried to close my eyes but was hit on them with the metal belt buckle. I lost the ability to see light and was almost blinded. Everything was dark. 
,  
I did not receive any medical treatment for my injuries, only beatings. 
,  
Transfer to Abu Zabal prison: “We couldn’t breathe” 
, 	After three long days in the police station, police officers packed us all into a small dark blue van. We were handcuffed together in pairs and crammed into the back of the van. The van was already full by the time my turn came to get in. 
,  
Things worsened once we reached the forecourt of the prison. The police locked the door of the van and abandoned us for seven hours to the sweltering heat of the Egyptian sun without water, food or fresh air. 
,  
Inside the van, in the midday heat, prisoners reached breaking point. Many were delirious and some were giving each other messages for their families in case they died. There were around 15 trucks waiting in the forecourt and each one took time to unload. We were in the third van. We couldn’t breathe given the high temperature and the very poor ventilation inside the truck. All of us were waiting to die. I felt like I had been kidnapped not arrested given the treatment I was facing. 
,  
Thirty seven prisoners died in the van behind ours. I heard them screaming after the police shot tear gas inside their van, and saw the look on the faces of those around me in the van I was in. Many of us were lost, powerless to help. We laid down, unable to take a breath. I felt like I was dying as I listened to the prisoners around me praying and gasping for air. After seven hours of torture, the police opened the iron door to go into the prison. I was transferred to Tora Prison four month later, where I have been held for 600 days on pre-trial detention for taking pictures. 
,  
“Our dignity was left at the prison gates” 
, 	Tora Prison is like a cemetery. I sleep on a cold tiled floor, my belongings hanging on a nail in the wall over my thin mattress. There is a tiny “kitchen” where we prepare our food. We have a single element electric cooker, which we also use for warmth in the winter months. The “kitchen” is adjacent to a squat-down drop toilet, which is basically a hole in the concrete floor. Both areas are separated by a hanging blanket to try and provide a sense of privacy. Our dignity was left at the prison gates. 
,  
I share a cell that measures three by four metres with 12 political prisoners. We have no access to sun or fresh air for days or weeks at a time. 
,  
My detention has been renewed ever since my arrest for 600 days. I have not been charged with any crime. I have been imprisoned without any investigation into the fabricated charges I am facing. 
,  
I am a photojournalist, not a criminal. My indefinite detention is psychologically unbearable. Not even animals would survive in these conditions.”

As if it weren’t bad enough. Iranian women face persistent systemic discrimination in terms of family law. New legislation being considered by Iran’s parliament is intended to roll back many of the gains women have made in the past decades and consign them to being barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. 
And on top of that, if they dare to protest about the inequities they suffer, they are sentenced to long prison terms, to be served in prisons where unsanitary conditions and medical neglect can quickly undermine their health. 
This is the fate of Bahareh Hedayat, an activist with The Campaign for Equality, a grassroots initiative, and a member of the Central Committee of the Office for the Consolidation of Unity, a national student body which has been active in calling for political reform and opposing human rights violations in recent years. She is currently serving a ten-year prison sentence in Evin Prison. She had been charged with a number of “offenses” including “interviews with foreign media,” “insulting the leader,” “insulting the president,” and “disrupting public order through participating in illegal gatherings.” 
Bahareh Hedayat has already served half of her prison sentence and is therefore eligible to be paroled under Iranian law. But concerned human rights activists need to urge the Iranian government to release her now so that she can receive medical attention for her health conditions.  
The situation for women has only gotten worse since Bahareh Hedayat’s arrest five years ago. As Amnesty International’s new report You Shall Procreate: Attacks on women’s sexual and reproductive rights in Iran details, Bill 446 currently being amended by the Parliament as per the recommendation of the Guardian Council and Bill 315, soon to be considered by Parliament, will result in the state interfering in women’s most intimate and personal decisions in the attempt to double Iran’s population. The human rights of women and girls would be violated and their autonomy greatly restricted if the bills become law. Among other provisions, women who have not had children will be disfavored in hiring decisions by employers and voluntary sterilization will be outlawed. 
Iranian women already face enormous challenges. A recent spate of acid-throwing may have been encouraged by officials who have urged the enforcement of Iran’s dress code for women. Women who have protested the acid attacks have themselves been subject to arrest. Furthermore, Iranian girls can be subjected to early and/or forced marriages. 
Act now to call on Iran’s Parliament to stop pushing through Bills 446 and 315. The Iranian government needs to respect the right of women to make the most basic decisions about their bodies and their families themselves.

“Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!” boomed the Wizard… This scene in the Wizard of Oz can of course be applied to many situations but it is particularly apt when it comes to the death penalty. Despite continued global progression towards universal abolition – and progression in transparency in a few states, a number of the world’s death penalty states keep attempting to draw the curtain closed. They do not want their population to know how ineffective the death penalty is, or how many people are executed – or even HOW the state executes prisoners. Why the secrecy? In general the more the public sees and learns about the death penalty, the less they like it. 
,  
Severely botched executions in the USA have lead to decreased willingness of drug sources (now only a few compounding pharmacies) to take part in the process. Instead of recognising that there simply is no humane way to execute, a number of US states have declared drug suppliers a state secret. Other states have resorted to passing legislation to use untried methods or methods (shooting and the electric chair) already abandoned by nearly all jurisdictions because of the lack of efficiency in killing. Fortunately there are states seriously examining death penalty repeal and joining the 18 states already without the death penalty. 
,  
Countries like China, Belarus and Viet Nam have declared all information on execution to be a state secret, even how many they carry out. Several US states have also declared information on their execution procedures secret. 
,  
International efforts to understand the global practice of the death penalty are also hampered by this secrecy. Limited cooperation by death penalty states has meant that the United Nations often refers to the reports of respected NGOs. Amnesty International is respected as one of the most reliable.

Today we release our annual report on the death penalty. A report that pulls back the curtain on state executions around the world – including the good news: the world is continuing to move to universal abolition. More countries are abandoning capital punishment, others have restricted laws, imposed moratoriums and applied greater respect to international law and standards. Others however have continued executing. Some have resumed executions. Many executions were carried out in cruel or inhumane ways sometimes in public. Progress in abolition was seen all around the world. You can find out more in the report, or via our interactive global map. This report gives hope but also explains why the world’s largest human rights organisation opposes the death penalty in all circumstances.

,  
Four decades of domination over almost all aspects of life in East Germany came to an abrupt halt exactly 25 years ago today. On 31 March 1990, one of the most intrusive surveillance organisations in human history, the Ministry for State Security, more infamously known as the Stasi, was dissolved. 
,  
Two months ago I was at the old Stasi headquarters, today a museum in Berlin, for an open day commemorating the storming of the building by East Germans a few weeks after the Berlin Wall fell. There were film screenings, discussions, information stands and a tour through the Stasi’s enormous archive that at one point contained files on an estimated six million people. Some say a file was kept for one in three citizens. 
,  
It took me an hour to wander through the archive. Thousands of Germans visiting the site appeared shell-shocked amid the labyrinth of corridors and ceiling-high filing cabinets that had documented and controlled their lives – or the lives of others – for years. The very building, with its grey concrete Communist-era architecture, was a symbol of fear – the place you were taken for interrogation or intimidation. 
,  
While the Stasi archive is overwhelming, today’s spies can gather far more information with a fraction of the effort. 
,  
The Snowden revelations suggest the NSA can collect 5 billion records of mobile phone location a day and 42 billion internet records – including email and browsing history – a month. 
,  
German organisation OpenDataCity estimates that while the Stasi archives would fill 48,000 filing cabinets, just one US government server could store so much data that, if printed out, the reams of paper would fill 42 trillion filing cabinets. 
,  
We know very little about what the NSA does with all this data. But, leaving historical parallels aside, the Stasi archive is a timely warning of the potential consequences of unchecked surveillance. It shows how quickly a system for identifying threats evolves into a desire to know everything about everyone. 
,  
If knowledge is power, so is personal data 
,  
The Stasi took surveillance to unprecedented, intrusive levels to gather deep knowledge about what people did and said, which they used to manipulate and control the population. 
,  
Like the USA and the UK, who today intercept our emails and internet records, the Stasi sought to infiltrate personal life to collect intimate information about peoples’ lives to identify those they considered a threat. In the Stasi museum today you can see the personal and seemingly inane material kept on file, including photographs of bedrooms and record collections. 
,  
The Stasi’s surveillance network spiralled out into every aspect of daily life. Among an estimated 274,000 employees were at least 174,000 informants, which would have been about 2.5% of the working population. 
,  
Informants snooped in every office, cultural and sporting society, and apartment building. They recorded people in their own homes and in the homes of their friends. 
,  
Modern mass surveillance achieves this omnipresence with a fraction of the manpower. Spies can scoop up massive quantities of electronic communications directly from the cables that deliver them and the servers that store them. Cold War snoops have been pushed aside by computers and algorithms. 
,  
Tools of the spy trade 
,  
Visit the Stasi museum and you will see the sinister spying tools and techniques of the past: machines for steaming open letters, disguises (fake moustaches) and training for infiltrating “subversive” groups and the cameras hidden in ties, cigarette packs or simply in apartment walls. 
,  
The Stasi steamed open letters, copied them, filed them and sent them on. They went into homes when people were out and bugged them. They tapped into the phone infrastructure of buildings. 
,  
By contrast, today’s spies sit behind a desk and rely on dozens of electronic programmes for spying on our life, from Prism to Tempora, to do the dirty work for them. 
,  
The NSA uses computer programmes like Optic Nerve to access web chats, or The Three Smurfs to turn on your mobile phone’s microphone to listen in and track your location. For the Stasi, that technology would have been “a dream come true” in the words of one former officer. 
,  
What is in your file? 
,  
The most emotionally-charged discovery for many visitors to the Stasi archive is finding out whether the secret police had a file on them. 
,  
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, 2.75 million people have asked to see their files. Germans and many foreigners who visited East Germany have been shocked to discover that Stasi spies took an interest in where they went and what they said, but also who spied on them – sometimes friends and family had been recruited or blackmailed into the informant network. 
,  
No wonder Germans are more convinced than their European neighbours about the importance of the human right to privacy. A whopping 69% of them are opposed to government mass surveillance, according to a recent Amnesty International poll conducted in 13 countries around the world. 
,  
We don’t yet know what impact mass surveillance of our internet use will have on today’s digital societies. But by its very existence, the Stasi museum shows how the chilling effect surveillance can have on free expression. As a result, few Germans take their right to privacy lightly.

There are important lessons for us to learn from this. The question is, in 25 years will millions be asking the NSA or other intelligence agencies for our files, to see if they snooped on our private lives?

How best to describe the rushed hearings the House of Commons’ Public Safety Committee held over the past few weeks examining Bill C-51, the government’s anti-terrorism law reforms?  Circus, farce and disgrace all come to mind.  I know, I was there on Amnesty International’s behalf earlier this month. 
,  
Having “heard” from the experts, today the Committee turns its attention to the text of the Bill itself.  Indications are that the government is only open to a handful of tweaking amendments, so expectations are low. 
,  
Concern about these sweeping reforms grows daily. Experts representing the perspectives of Indigenous peoples, human rights and civil liberties groups, Muslim Canadians, environmental organizations, the legal community, the country’s privacy watchdog, immigrants and refugees, the labour movement, former judges and politicians and others have enumerated numerous shortcomings.  
,  
As awareness has spread, there has been a noticeable shift in the attitudes of Canadians from initial support for the Bill to growing disquiet.  That has been apparent in polling numbers, turnout for demonstrations and uptake of petitions. 
,  
The list of what needs to be added, rewritten or jettisoned is long.  For that reason Amnesty International and many others have said the Bill should simply be withdrawn.  Any further national security law reform should go forward on the basis of a clear assessment of current laws, and with human rights compliance as an overarching imperative. 
,  
There is no sign that the government is prepared to start again.  Will they, at least, be responsive to the pleas for improvement?  Here are ten for a start. 
,  
First, the resounding call that this Bill be accompanied by effective expert review and robust parliamentary oversight of the entirety of Canada’s national security agencies and departments must be answered. 
,  
Next, the stunning proposition that CSIS agents can violate the Charter when acting to reduce security threats, on the basis of secretive Federal Court warrants expressly authorizing those breaches, has to be abandoned.  Judges are there to uphold, not undermine, the Charter.  We expect the same of CSIS.   The government says it will now specify that CSIS’ new powers don’t include arresting people.  Concerns here go far beyond that possibility. 
,  
Related to that concern, exempting CSIS agents from the laws, particularly the human rights laws, of foreign countries in which they operate is not on.  That provision must be removed. 
,  
Fourth, criminalizing promoting and advocating the commission of terrorism offences ‘in general’ is both vague and broad. It will violate and, more insidiously, chill free expression in many ways.  It adds nothing to existing offences dealing with inciting, threatening and counselling terrorism. It should be pulled. 
,  
Fifth, Canadian law is already on tenuous ground in allowing detention without charge in terrorism cases. Presently it is limited to three days and requires a reasonable belief that terrorist activity will be carried out.  Extending that to seven days detention without charge, at the lower threshold of believing that terrorist activity may be carried out, undercuts the fundamental principle that a loss of liberty be tied to lawful arrest, a recognized charge and a fair trial. 
,  
Then there is the fact that the Bill’s new threat reduction powers and expanded information sharing regime only protect demonstrations considered to be ‘lawful’.  Lawfulness is not defined.  The government says it will clarify that this does not apply to Indigenous, environmental, labour and other protesters. We will be watching.  
,  
Seventh, the secrecy and arbitrariness of no-fly lists has been hugely problematic since September 11th. It is at least positive that the Bill brings that fraught process into a legal framework.   But it does not offer a fair appeal process for people challenging decisions to bar them from flying.  That has to be improved. 
,  
There has been much talk about the expansive information sharing provisions in Bill C-51.  Where are the lessons from cases like Maher Arar, Abdullah  Almalki, Ahmad Elmaati and Muayyed Nurreddin?  Sharing irrelevant, inflammatory or inaccurate information causes terrible abuses, including torture.  This limitless approach to information sharing needs to be reined in with human rights safeguards.  The government promises some tightening up.  But serious concerns remain. 
,  
Ninth, Bill C-51 takes a swipe at immigrants and refugees, increasing secrecy and further restricting the quality of justice they are afforded in security cases.  This area needs improvement not retrenchment.   These provisions need to go. 
,  
Finally, given the Bill’s blatant disregard – even contempt – for human rights obligations, there needs to be specific incorporation of the Charter of Rights and international human rights treaties. 
,  
The best news from the government would be that they are abandoning C-51.  At a minimum Canadians deserve changes that put human rights at the heart of the country’s approach to addressing terrorism.  That is a far better guarantor of our collective security.

Related to that concern, exempting CSIS agents from the laws, particularly the human rights laws, of foreign countries in which they operate is not on.  That provision must be removed. 
Fourth, criminalizing promoting and advocating the commission of terrorism offences ‘in general’ is both vague and broad. It will violate and, more insidiously, chill free expression in many ways.  It adds nothing to existing offences dealing with inciting, threatening and counselling terrorism. It should be pulled. 
Fifth, Canadian law is already on tenuous ground in allowing detention without charge in terrorism cases. Presently it is limited to three days and requires a reasonable belief that terrorist activity will be carried out.  Extending that to seven days detention without charge, at the lower threshold of believing that terrorist activity may be carried out, undercuts the fundamental principle that a loss of liberty be tied to lawful arrest, a recognized charge and a fair trial. 
Then there is the fact that the Bill’s new threat reduction powers and expanded information sharing regime only protect demonstrations considered to be ‘lawful’.  Lawfulness is not defined.  The government says it will clarify that this does not apply to Indigenous, environmental, labour and other protesters. We will be watching.  
Seventh, the secrecy and arbitrariness of no-fly lists has been hugely problematic since September 11th. It is at least positive that the Bill brings that fraught process into a legal framework.   But it does not offer a fair appeal process for people challenging decisions to bar them from flying.  That has to be improved. 
There has been much talk about the expansive information sharing provisions in Bill C-51.  Where are the lessons from cases like Maher Arar, Abdullah  Almalki, Ahmad Elmaati and Muayyed Nurreddin?  Sharing irrelevant, inflammatory or inaccurate information causes terrible abuses, including torture.  This limitless approach to information sharing needs to be reined in with human rights safeguards.  The government promises some tightening up.  But serious concerns remain. 
Ninth, Bill C-51 takes a swipe at immigrants and refugees, increasing secrecy and further restricting the quality of justice they are afforded in security cases.  This area needs improvement not retrenchment.   These provisions need to go. 
Finally, given the Bill’s blatant disregard – even contempt – for human rights obligations, there needs to be specific incorporation of the Charter of Rights and international human rights treaties. 
The best news from the government would be that they are abandoning C-51.  At a minimum Canadians deserve changes that put human rights at the heart of the country’s approach to addressing terrorism.  That is a far better guarantor of our collective security.

Three lively community groups came together in Peterborough on March 22 to meet Father Alberto Franco, a Redemptorist priest and dedicated human rights defender from Bogota, Colombia. 
,  
Father Franco leads the Colombian Justice and Peace Commission in a dangerous and unstable atmosphere. He is known to Amnesty International as the subject of an Urgent Action appeal two years ago. He was threatened many time and shot at once. He smiles as he admits that, at the behest of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, he now travels with guards. 
,  
Father Franco’s work involves accompanying peasants and indigenous people in the region of Choco in northern Colombia as they strive, first to survive in a warring area, and then to return home and re-establish communities of peace. His office provides legal and social-psychological support, education and communication for exploited groups as they assert their rights to livelihood and stability. 
,  
For many years Colombia has been rent with conflict as the wealthy and corporations grab land for cash crops or minerals. Father Franco hailed the recent Amnesty campaign, “Life before Profit” targeting mining companies, including Canadian ones. 
, 	Just this week, Amnesty issued an Urgent Action calling for messages to President Juan Santos for the safety of four of Father Franco’s colleagues. 
,  
The three Peterborough groups were Development and Peace, the Catholic organization which brought Fr Franco here as their Lenten visitor, the local Colombian refugee community led by Sister Ruth Henessey of Casa Maria House, and Amnesty Group 46. 
,  
The gathering showed the depth of Canadian concern for Colombia and the strength to be found in unity among grassroots groups.

0,10 myths about the death penalty,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/10-myths-about-death-penalty/,"Myth 1: Only evil people who have committed horrific crimes are executed FACT: The death penalty applies to a number of different crimes worldwide, not all of which are horrific.

In many countries, such as Iran and Sudan, authorities execute their political opponents. In North Korea, citizens have been publicly executed for communicating with individuals outside of their country. 
Regardless of the crime committed, there is more to an individual than their worst offence. Many of the prisoners on death row in the US suffered horrific abuses prior to committing violent crimes; and are a product of their environments. 
Research has also consistently shown that individuals are capable of change. Following the 1972 United States Supreme Court decision that the arbitrary application of the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment, 322 death-row prisoners were released. Only 5 of those 322 prisoners murdered again. The vast majority were capable of rehabilitation; and most were incredibly remorseful for their crimes. 
These figures strongly suggest the majority of individuals who commit violent crimes are not ‘evil’. It is also evidence that permanent incarceration is suitable punishment for violent crimes, rather than execution. 
FACT: No justice system is free from error; and not all individuals who are sentenced to the death penalty are guilty of the crimes for which they have been convicted. 
Since 1973, 144 death row prisoners have been exonerated in the US alone. As long as criminal justice systems remain fallible, there is a possibility of executing innocent people. 
FACT: Around the world, many people are still executed after grossly unfair trials and/or after being subjected to torture. The top three executing countries – Iraq, Iran and China – all issue death sentences in unclear circumstances. 
In Pakistan, a 14-year-old boy named Shafqat is currently awaiting execution after ‘confessing’ to kidnapping and involuntary manslaughter after nine days of torture. By taking action, you can help save his life. 
FACT: People who are convicted of the same crimes are often given different sentences, both across the world and in the same country. Research has consistently shown that individuals are more likely to be given the death penalty if they are poor or belong to a racial, ethnic or religious minority. The reason for this is two-fold: individuals from poorer, marginalised groups have less access to the resources needed to defend themselves; and there is inherent discrimination present in the justice system. 
FACT: All types of execution risk causing the victim extreme pain. This is especially the case for execution by hanging, shooting, stoning and beheading. Even lethal injections, which are meant to be the most humane form of execution, still risk incredible pain, especially if the part of the injection process meant to knock the prisoner out is botched. 
FACT: There is no convincing evidence that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime. Many murders take place when the perpetrators are under great emotional stress, or under the influence of drugs – times when they are not considering the consequences. 
Research has consistently shown that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than other punishments. 
A 1988 United Nations research report found: “…it is not prudent to accept the hypothesis that capital punishment deters murder to a marginally greater extent than does the threat and application of the supposedly lesser punishment of life imprisonment”. 
In Canada, the homicide rate actually fell by 40 per cent in the three decades following 1975, the year before the death penalty for murder was abolished. Research from other countries has failed to show that repealing the death penalty causes an increase in crime rates. 
The use of the death penalty cannot be credited with making societies any safer. 
FACT: Individuals who are willing to kill or injure others for the sake of a cause or ideology are unlikely to be deterred by the prospect of execution. In fact, counter-terrorism officials have often pointed out that individuals who are executed may be perceived as martyrs, whose memory may become a rallying point for ideology or organisations. Armed opposition groups have also used the death penalty as justification for retaliation, thereby continuing the cycle of violence. 
FACT: At least in the US, enforcing the death penalty is more expensive than imprisoning individuals for life. The judicial process is much longer and more complicated. The California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice estimated that, in California, death penalty trials cost approximately $1.1 million more than the average murder trial. The Commission estimated that the death penalty system cost California approximately $125 million more per year than the cost of permanent incarceration. This money could be diverted towards early prevention and intervention strategies, which would prevent crimes punishable by the death penalty from occurring and reduce the number of people on death row. 
FACT: Not all victims’ families are in favour of the death penalty. The international movement against the death penalty involves many individuals who have lost loved ones to violent crime, but for ethical or religious reasons are not in favour of the death penalty. The New Hampshire-based organisation Murder Victims’ Families for Human Rights is helping lead the movement to abolish the death penalty in the US. 
FACT: History presents us with numerous examples of human rights abuses supported by the majority at the time – prominently including slavery, lynching and racial segregation. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life, as enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. It is also cruel, inhuman and degrading. 
Amnesty opposes the death penalty at all times; regardless of who is accused, the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution. Even if the majority of the public supports the death penalty, it should not be treated as an acceptable form of punishment under any circumstance.

What is surveillance? 
, 	Surveillance is the monitoring of a person’s communications, actions or movements. 
,  
When is surveillance legal? 
, 	Broadly, when it is necessary, targeted, based on sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, and authorised by a strictly independent authority, such as a judge. 
,  
What is mass surveillance? 
, 	Indiscriminate mass surveillance is the monitoring of internet and phone communications of large numbers of people – sometimes entire countries – without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. 
,  
Can mass surveillance ever be legal? 
, 	Governments can legalise mass surveillance in their own country, but that would completely contradict the international laws that most nations have signed up to. 
,  
Who are the ‘five eyes’? 
, 	The five eyes refers to an intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK and USA. 
,  
What is GCHQ? 
, 	Government Communications Headquarters is the security agency responsible for providing communications intelligence to the UK government. 
,  
What is the NSA? 
, 	The National Security Agency is responsible for collecting and analysing intelligence information and data in the USA. 
,  
Are governments spying on me? 
, 	If you use the internet or a mobile phone, the answer is probably ‘yes’. Secret government surveillance Programmes like Prism and Upstream (run by the NSA) and Tempora (run by GCHQ) are believed to spy on you both by obtaining data from Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other major Internet companies, and by directly tapping into fibre-optic cables that carry global internet communications. The breathtaking scope of these programmes and the way in which global electronic communications are routed mean that people in nearly every country on earth can be spied on. 
,  
What data are they collecting? 
, 	The NSA and GCHQ have powerful surveillance programs that store and analyse people’s browser history, internet searches, emails, instant messages, webcam conversations and phone calls. They also collect metadata, or ‘data about data’, which includes email recipients, call times and location records. 
,  
What happens to my data? 
, 	It’s stored in large data centres where it can be searched and analysed by computer algorithms. Data collected by the NSA and GCHQ is also made available to officers of the other ‘five eyes’ security agencies through powerful databases such as XKeyscore. Intelligence agencies in 41 countries have different levels of access to the data.

How does mass surveillance affect our human rights? 
, 	It’s a serious violation of our privacy. It also restricts free speech, as people may be less willing to communicate freely if they know they are being monitored.

It’s worth repeating, Bill C-51 is important, very important. Rarely does legislation touch so directly on two of the most fundamental imperatives of government: to protect our security and uphold our rights. How crucial therefore to be sure that it is carefully and thoughtfully studied, with input from groups and experts who can offer analysis, highlight shortcomings and make recommendations for improvement. 
Instead, what I heard from government members of the Committee was troubling and disheartening. The experience fortifies my belief that it is crucial that Canadians across the country raise their voices and insist that the government withdraw this version of the Bill and proceed only with law reform that complies with international human rights obligations. The government is not listening. We need to be louder. 
That, however, is precisely what is not happening with the debate about Bill C-51. I saw that first hand when I appeared before the Committee entrusted with the responsibility of giving it very careful and deliberation consideration, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, during the evening of March 12th.  
Amnesty International and many other groups and prominent Canadians have spoken out in alarm over the past several weeks, as Bill C-51 violates, undermines and ignores human rights in ways that are both brazen and insidious.  The list of concerned groups, experts and eminent Canadians is too long to recite but includes former Prime Ministers, Ministers and Supreme Court Justices; past members of various national security and police review bodies; the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations; Canada’s Privacy Commissioner; law professors from across Canada; and countless national and local human rights, civil liberties, Muslim, environmental, First Nations, labour and other organizations in every corner of the country.  Editorials and media commentary, too, have been near-universal in decrying that this is legislation that goes too far. Notably, the concerns come from across the political spectrum.  It has been an almost unprecedented outcry. 
With that in mind and freshly back from a cross-country speaking tour during which people everywhere shared their bewilderment and fear about C-51, I sat down in the Committee hearing room last night with a strong sense of responsibility and with hope that there would be constructive exchange.  I shared one hour of Committee time with close colleague Ihsaan Gardee, the Executive Director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) and Carleton University professor Elliot Tepper. 
The restrictions on hearing time remain a grave problem. It is in fact stunning to consider some of the groups and experts who are being frozen out of the process: the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canada’s Privacy Commissioner and the expert corps of Special Advocates who work within the immigration security certificate process. 
There wasn’t a word about any of that. That is the debate we should be having.

0,8 Facts You Need to Know: Why We’re Suing to Stop Surveillance – and Protect Human Rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/8-facts-you-need-to-know-why-were-suing-to-stop-surveillance-and-protect-human-rights/,"Amnesty International USA has gone to court, represented by the ACLU, because in a world under threat of constant, all-encompassing surveillance, our work to protect human rights is made much harder. , The U.S. surveillance machine is thwarting Amnesty International USA’s ability to protect...","Amnesty International USA has gone to court, represented by the ACLU, because in a world under threat of constant, all-encompassing surveillance, our work to protect human rights is made much harder. 
,  
The U.S. surveillance machine is thwarting Amnesty International USA’s ability to protect people from human rights violations: including governments that torture, kidnap and extrajudiciallly kill people for their non-violent protest, dissent and activism. 
,  
Here are 8 facts you need to know about how Amnesty International works – and why mass surveillance harms our ability to protect human rights: 
,  
1. Amnesty International bears witness to brutality, violence and atrocities. We send researchers into conflict zones. We are on the ground in places throughout the world to collect evidence of human rights abuses. 
,  
We ask people to tell us the horrors they saw – whether they are the witnesses or the lone survivors. 
,  
2. These people – our sources – are often taking a personal risk by talking to us. Our worst fear is that they could be retaliated against – by police, intelligence or security forces who found out they spoke to us. 
,  
It is for this reason that we take precautions to ensure the confidentiality of our communications and their identities. 
,  
3. But in a world of mass surveillance by the U.S. government, our precautions may not provide enough protection to our sources. 
,  
When Edward Snowden was asked if the U.S. spied on “highly sensitive and confidential communications” of human rights organizations including Amnesty International, he responded: “The answer is, without question, yes. Absolutely.” And the U.S. government has never officially denied Snowden’s allegation. 
,  
4. Even putting that aside, the sheer enormity of the U.S. surveillance machine can cause our sources to fear they can’t talk to us without being put under U.S. surveillance. 
,  
And the U.S. shares troves of information with foreign governments. In other words, by talking to us, our sources are placed  on the radar of the very same abusive governments about which they were reporting—including governments that have records of killing dissidents, or throwing them  into incommunicado detention and torturing them with impunity. 
,  
5. If our sources don’t trust that we can protect the confidentiality of our conversations—protect them from surveillance, and thereby protect them from retaliation by their governments—they may understandably choose not to talk to us. 
,  
6. And if our sources fear they can’t talk to us, we can’t do our work—to document what they saw, to tell the world, to campaign and put a stop to further human rights abuses. 
,  
7. There’s another risk – to Amnesty International USA. Even if our sources do talk to us, our emails and Skype calls are likely under surveillance by the U.S. government—thanks to its expansive interpretation of U.S. legal authority. 
,  
When an Amnesty International researcher emails an Amnesty International USA advocate in Washington D.C., for example, about his interview with witnesses of a U.S. drone strike, the U.S. government could  collect and very likely read that email. The same could happen to privileged client-attorney communications. 
,  
8. Some people might say, “So what?” But, imagine if the government had a five-month heads up on every piece of investigative journalism or potential exposé. Imagine how it might cover its tracks – and cover up its abuses. 
,  
Now imagine that surveillance was just a part of a Global, Forever War:  imagine it was just one of several government powers practiced with extreme secrecy, premised on impunity for abuses, and kept permanent by design. 
,  
That is the grim reality we are fighting against – that is the reality we are challenging in court today.

Campaigning against laws in Iran which discriminate against women and girls has just gotten a whole lot harder for Bahareh Hedayat and other activists with the Campaign for Equality, as Iran moves to enact laws set to turn Iranian women and girls into baby-making machines. Bahareh is currently serving a 10-year sentence in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison for her peaceful activism in support of gender equality. 
Two proposed laws will reverse decades of progress in empowering women and girls in Iran. 
Bill 446 to Increase Fertility Rates and Prevent Population Decline aims to double Iran’s population by outlawing voluntary sterilization (the second most common method of birth control in Iran), curbing use of modern contraceptives, banning education about contraception, and cutting funding for state-funded family planning programs. The bill was approved by parliament in August 2014 and is undergoing amendments as recommended by the Guardian Council, which needs to approve it before it can become law. 
Bill 315, the Comprehensive Population and Exaltation of Family Bill, encourages early marriage, repeated childbearing and lower divorce rates, and allows discrimination against female job candidates—particularly if they are single or without children. It will also make divorce more difficult, and discourages law enforcement and the courts from intervening in family disputes, including those involving violence against women. The bill is due to be discussed by parliament next month. 
The list of human rights that Bills 446 and 315 will violate is long and includes the right to live free from violence and the right to live free from discrimination. The bills also violate sexual and reproductive rights. Under international law, women and girls have the right to make decisions about whether and when to marry, and whether, when, and how many children to have. They have rights to receive information about family planning and to be able to access contraception. All these rights will be taken away if these bills pass into law. Gender stereotyping and discrimination will become even more firmly entrenched in Iranian law. 
Without access to affordable modern contraception, the rate of unwanted pregnancies will undoubtedly rise, forcing women to seek illegal and unsafe abortions. Lack of access to condoms will lead to a rise in sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. 
Women and girls will be forced to stay in marriages where they experience violence because divorce will be more difficult to obtain and the state will be less likely to intervene to protect women and girls. And women will be further marginalized in the workforce. 
Sexual violence and discrimination against women and girls is already rife in Iran and women are already denied equal rights with respect to marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance, travel, and even in their choice of clothing. Women even face restrictions on watching sports in public stadiums. These two bills will serve to further marginalize women and girls in Iran, and confine them to the roles of mothers and wives. 
After the 1979 revolution, Iranian authorities believed that a large population would be a source of military strength and national security. To increase the birth rate, family planning programs were suspended, a campaign for early marriage and repeated childbearing was adopted, and large families received social benefits. In 1980, the average birth rate was 7.0 per woman. 
By the end of the 1980s, with a war-shattered economy, Iran was unable to meet the needs of the rapidly growing and young population and instituted family planning and reproductive health service programs, including free contraception, and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education programs. In 2014, the average birth rate had dropped to 1.5 children per woman. Until recently (when barriers to post-secondary education for women were introduced), women constituted the majority of university graduates and about 17% of the country’s work force. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei denounced Iran’s family planning policies as imitating a Western lifestyle and has ordered authorities to increase Iran’s population from 78.5 million to 150-200 million. His orders reflect Iran’s concern over its declining population growth and the perceived impact of this on Iran’s aspiration to be a dominant regional power with an overwhelmingly Shia population. 
Iran has relegated women and girls in Iran to being baby-making machines, and with their policies and funding have turned these “machines” on and off at will for decades. 
Activists in Iran bravely continue to stand up and confront these grave violations of human rights. 
Bahareh remains in prison for promoting gender equality. 
Her fellow activist Atena Farghadani drew a cartoon depicting members of parliament casting a ballot. The cartoon was critical of members of parliament for considering Bill 446. She too is now in prison and on a hunger strike. 
Many of their fellow activists have been in and out of prison. They risk arrest, torture, and long jail sentences in abhorrent conditions for standing up for their beliefs.

Follow Alex on Twitter @AlexNeveAmnesty 
,  
Want to feel more secure?  Bill C-51, which is being examined by a Parliamentary committee in  three weeks of truncated hearings, offers up criminal offences that infringe free expression, unprecedented intrusive intelligence powers, breathtakingly vast definitions of security, unbridled sharing of information and stunning levels of secrecy; all while doing nothing to enhance review, oversight and accountability of Canada’s national security agencies.  
,  
The message is that human rights have to give way to keep terrorism at bay.  The relationship between the two is seen as a zero-sum game.  More safety means fewer rights.  Stronger regard for rights leads to greater insecurity. 
,  
It is time to turn that around.  Human rights do not stand in the way of security that is universal, durable and inclusive.  Human rights are in fact the very key. 
,  
In C-51 we are faced with a set of brand new and significantly revised national security laws that could undermine human rights more insidiously than at any time since the October 1970 invocation of the War Measures Act. 
,  
No surprise therefore that an impressive list of former Prime Ministers and other eminent politicians, intelligence experts, legal academics, human rights groups, commentators and editorials (including this paper) have raised the alarm that this Bill is bad news for human rights. 
,  
Prime Minister Harper disagrees.  He insists that freedom and security go “hand in hand”.  But his government’s actions fail to live up to his stirring rhetoric. 
,  
Nothing illustrates that better than CSIS’ new threat reduction powers.  Preventing terrorism before it happens is obviously a good thing.  But this is not the way to go about it.  
,  
The Bill does not specify what CSIS agents are allowed to do in the name of reducing security threats (notably the definition of threats goes far beyond terrorism to include protests and blockades which are not considered lawful).  
,  
We do know that CSIS agents can’t kill, commit bodily harm, pervert justice or violate sexual integrity.  That is reassuring, one supposes.  But what of all the human rights violations that aren’t on that no-go list?  
,  
It doesn’t end there.  Bill C-51 authorizes Federal Court judges to approve, in secret hearings, CSIS threat reduction activities that would violate the Charter of Rights.  So much for the notion that the judiciary are to be the guardians of the constitution. 
,  
And these threat reduction powers can be carried out anywhere in the world.  If outside Canada, the Bill instructs judges to simply disregard foreign laws when issuing warrants. 
,  
This approach to national security has been discredited.  Allowing secretive human rights violations while fighting terrorism adds up to a heap of injustice.  It also generally does nothing to improve security and may, to the contrary, deepen insecurity.  More victims, grievances and divisions do not keep us safer in the end.  That is why, for example, the Director of the CIA and various retired US Admirals and Generals, among many others, have called for Guantánamo Bay to be shut down. 
,  
Also disappointing is the failure to learn from recent examples of the heavy toll of national security gone awry.  Two judicial inquiries have examined Canada’s complicity in the overseas torture of Maher Arar, Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou-Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin.  Important court rulings have exposed Canada’s responsibility for national security-linked human rights violations, including two Supreme Court rulings dealing with Omar Khadr.  Numerous expert UN bodies have pressed Canada to make changes as well. 
,  
Rather than clean up that record; Bill C-51 adds to it.  As such, five years from now one can easily imagine some version of a Commission of Inquiry into Certain Human Rights Violations Associated with Covert CSIS Threat Reduction Activities Abroad.  
,  
End runs around the ban on torture, prohibitions on unlawful arrest and imprisonment, fair trial guarantees and protection against discrimination haven’t delivered a safer world. 
,  
The best national security reforms would scrupulously comply with international human rights laws and would guard against complicity in abuses by other states.  They would be accompanied by a determined effort to remedy past human rights violations and tidy up existing laws and policies that fall short of international requirements. Reforms would be backed up by robust oversight and effective review to make sure obligations are met.  
,  
Embracing, not ignoring, human rights is where we need to start — and where we need to end up.

Follow Alex on Twitter @AlexNeveAmnesty. 
,  
Most of us never give it a second thought; our nationality.  We were born with it or may have gained a second or third nationality by moving to another country, through our ancestry or by marriage.  We are usually proud of it.  We enjoy, need and may boast about it when we travel.  But we don’t often think about what it would be like not to have it or to lose it. 
,  
Nationality is fundamental. It provides our identity in both a legal and cultural sense.  It is also the source of so many other rights: to vote, to participate and serve in government, to travel freely; and to be able to access education, medical care and employment. It establishes that there is a government to whom we can turn for support and protection.  It is essential.  That is why the right to a nationality is enshrined in article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
,  
But around the world at least ten million people have no nationality and are instead stateless.  Statelessness is, in many respects, a hidden human rights abuse.  It is hidden by its very definition; as its victims lack the full legal protection of a state, are more vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination, and very often need to live in secrecy and silence. 
,  
That is why the UNHCR has launched a new global campaign to end statelessness within the next ten years. The campaign has a hashtag that powerfully captures what is at stake: #IBELONG. 
,  
So what of Canada? 
,  
Concerns about Canadian laws, policies or decisions making people stateless have not been widespread by any measure. 
,  
But a current case has starkly demonstrated that it can and does happen here.  The case of Deepan Budlakoti highlights not only that there is statelessness in Canada but that government decisions can and do make it happen.  Particularly troubling in Deepan’s case is the determined refusal of the Canadian government to take the steps to ensure his statelessness comes to an end and that he is able to enjoy his right to a nationality. 
,  
Deepan’s story is unique, but that does not make the human rights implications any less compelling.  His parents were Indian nationals living in Canada at the time of his birth back in 1989.  (They gained Canadian nationality later.)  They had been employed by an Indian diplomat in Ottawa; but Deepan and his family assert they were no longer in the diplomat’s employ when he was born.  That is a key consideration.  Under Canadian law babies born in Canada are recognized as citizens, even if their parents are not Canadian.  But one exception is children born in Canada to parents with diplomatic status.  
,  
Deepan Budlakoti grew up Canadian, taking his Canadian status as a given.  At one point, after she had gained Canadian citizenship, his mother listed Deepan on her Canadian passport.  When he was fourteen he obtained his own Canadian passport, relying on his Canadian birth certificate.  
,  
But he has had troubles.  He had conflict with his family while growing up and was in the care of Children’s Aid for a while. He has firearms and drug trafficking convictions and has served his time for those offences, a three year sentence. 
,  
Following his criminal convictions, Canadian officials decided they had made a mistake and determined that Deepan Budlakoti is not a Canadian citizen after all, earlier passports notwithstanding.  They disputed the assertion that his parents were no longer diplomatic employees when he was born, rejecting evidence from the diplomat himself that they had left his employ before the birth.   
,  
It doesn’t end there though. India refuses to recognize Deepan as an Indian national.  He is, therefore, currently stateless.  Whatever the final outcome is in court battles about whether Deepan’s parents were or were not in diplomatic employ when he was born, the uncontroverted truth is this: he lives in Canada; and has lived in Canada his entire life.  All other members of his family have Canadian citizenship.  In fact, Canada recognized him as a citizen for many years. 
,  
Stateless, Deepan is now unable to obtain a passport, meaning travel is impossible.  He is also currently embroiled in a legal challenge to obtain medical coverage through OHIP, despite having lived in Ontario his whole life.  The effects of statelessness – of exclusion, of a denial of other rights, of being forced to live in the shadows – are starting to take their toll. 
,  
This is not just about bureaucracy, paperwork and Canadian laws.  It is above all a human rights issue. There is an international obligation to prevent and reduce statelessness. In fact, Canada has been a party to the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness since 1978 (notably India is not a party).   There is an international right to a nationality.  These are rights that should not be violated and rights that should be actively respected.  
,  
Even though they both argue the contrary, either Canada or India could act to reduce statelessness and uphold the right to a nationality in this case.  But who has the stronger obligation and responsibility?  Is it the country where he has lived all of his life, or a country with which he has no meaningful connections?  Seems pretty clear, but Canada defiantly refuses to take the step of once again recognizing him as Canadian.  Instead he is it to be cast out. 
,  
Amnesty International has written twice to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration about Deepan Budlakoti’s case.  All we were told in response is that the government is “committed to the fair and equitable application of Canada’s immigration laws.” Hard to see what is fair or equitable here? 
,  
Deepan is but one among the 10 million stateless people around the world whose plight has sparked the UNHCR’s #IBELONG campaign.  In that campaign the UN notes that a child is born stateless somewhere in the world every ten minutes.  Surely Canada can take the right step – the ‘human rights’ step – and turn back statelessness in at least this one case; by restoring a nationality to Deepan Budlakoti. 
,  
Note: Alex will be speaking about Deepan’s case at the event “Statelessness, Citizenship and Belonging” at Carleton University on March 12th at 6 pm.  Details available here.

Amnesty International has written twice to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration about Deepan Budlakoti’s case.  All we were told in response is that the government is “committed to the fair and equitable application of Canada’s immigration laws.” Hard to see what is fair or equitable here? 
Deepan is but one among the 10 million stateless people around the world whose plight has sparked the UNHCR’s #IBELONG campaign.  In that campaign the UN notes that a child is born stateless somewhere in the world every ten minutes.  Surely Canada can take the right step – the ‘human rights’ step – and turn back statelessness in at least this one case; by restoring a nationality to Deepan Budlakoti. 
Note: Alex will be speaking about Deepan’s case at the event “Statelessness, Citizenship and Belonging” at Carleton University on March 12th at 6 pm.  Details available here.

,  
This International Women’s Day, we look back 20 years to a historic UN meeting in Beijing that saw world leaders make bold commitments to women’s rights. Stella Jegher, Chair of the Amnesty International Women’s Human Rights Network, sheds light on how Amnesty made a difference to the debate then – and continues to do so now. 
,  
Twenty years ago, in the autumn of 1995, the city of Beijing witnessed a historic moment for women’s rights: People from all over the world travelled to China for the UN’s fourth World Conference on Women. Five thousand government delegates from 189 countries, thousands of journalists and over four thousand NGO representatives gathered for the official Conference in Beijing. 
,  
Fifty kilometres away in the town of Houairou, 35,000 people met at the largest ever NGO meeting on women’s human rights. As one of the NGOs allowed to attend both meetings, Amnesty was able to bring the demands of women’s organizations in Houairou to the UN conference in Beijing. 
,  
,  
Together they made history, creating the most comprehensive and progressive political agreement on women’s human rights ever endorsed by the international community: the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. 
,  
It was a historic moment for Amnesty, too. It was the first time that we were even allowed into China, let alone hold a press conference there – an opportunity that we used to raise awareness about the huge human rights violations in the country. It was also the moment to raise our profile in defending women’s rights. 
,  
As both a worldwide movement of people and a highly respected and experienced human rights advocacy organization, Amnesty had a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the concerns of grassroots women were heard at the government level – and represented in the Platform for Action. 
,  
,  
However, bringing women’s human rights into the Beijing Platform for Action was not a given. It was only two years since the international community had acknowledged women’s rights as human rights at a conference in Vienna. Yet, several governments and pressure groups already wanted to go back on that statement. Issues like a total ban on all forms of violence against women were again highly contested. 
,  
As a result, Amnesty demanded that the international community  renew its commitment to the universality and indivisibility of women’s human rights. State violence against women, women’s human rights in armed conflict, violence such as female genital mutilation occurring in the private sphere and in communities, as well as the protection of women activists, were other priorities on which Amnesty tried to influence the outcome of the Beijing Conference. 
,  
After months of preparations and 10 days of intense negotiations, the international community came up with “a document that Amnesty International can do business with to hold governments accountable”, in the words of our then Secretary General Pierre Sané. The next step was putting the Platform into action. 
,  
,  
Within a few years, we launched Stop Violence against Women, which became one of our most comprehensive and successful global campaigns. Many of the issues we campaigned for during those six years were directly linked to the promises governments had made at Beijing. We continued to work closely with women human rights defenders, writing reports and developing bold activism around many forms of violence against women, contributing to concrete progress in legislation and policies. 
,  
However, the challenges are still there, and the most contested issues with regard to women’s human rights are still the same. First and foremost, the right of every woman to make informed decisions about her own body and to have a say in the laws, policies and programmes that affect her life are still questioned. That is why, in 2014, Amnesty launched the My Body My Rights campaign, highlighting sexual and reproductive rights as core elements of all women’s human rights. 
,  
,  
Sexual and reproductive rights will feature prominently in a UN meeting in New York this March to review progress since Beijing. However, there is still a big push by conservative governments and powerful interest groups, including religious groups, to relegate women to the role of wives and mothers, to stifle their voices on political issues, and to keep them isolated from important roles in society. 
,  
Twenty years after Beijing, Amnesty still has a pivotal role to play in amplifying the voices of women and translating grassroots demands into the language of diplomacy. With a much broader understanding of the situation of women and girls in so many countries, with our collective experience and sound partnerships with grassroots movements, and with 20 years more experience in lobbying for women’s human rights, we are perfectly positioned to make women’s voices heard.

Yesterday, the world celebrated International Women’s Day. Today, world leaders descend on the United Nations in New York to take stock of how much they have achieved in the 20 years since a historic meeting in Beijing, where they promised to protect and promote the rights of women and girls everywhere. Dr Renu Adhikari will be among the many activists in New York. She tells us what progress she’s seen over the last two decades. 
,  
I have worked on women’s rights for the last 24 years in Nepal. I started out working on trafficking and HIV. I had met a girl who had been trafficked and her story made me re-think whether I should continue being a medical doctor or do something in women’s rights. At that time, I had no idea what an NGO was. Still, in 1991 I created the Women’s Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC) out of my passion for women’s rights. 
,  
When I started going out to the villages, I learned about structural discrimination and that we needed to dig deeper into women’s rights. Once, I met a woman who complained of back ache at a health camp. When I examined her, I found a piece of rubber from a slipper in her vagina. I pulled it out, and part of her uterus came out along with puss, blood and discharge. I was shocked. 
,  
She told me her story. She was married at 13. By 19 she had already been pregnant four times, including two miscarriages. By 23 she had uterine prolapse and her husband had married another woman. As a single mother she had to work extra hard. At that time, no one was talking about uterine prolapse. This was 23 years ago. 
,  
I started to write and talk about the issue. It was not easy. I was stigmatized by my fellow doctors who asked why do you only talk about the uterus?, but I had a good friend [and ally], Dr Aruna, and I started campaigning. I taught women how to use a ring pessary and also campaigned on ending gender-based violence at the community, state and national levels. 
,  
There are some moments in history where everything gets accumulated and comes out. Beijing was like that. 
,  
,  
In 1994 I went to the preparatory meetings in New York City for the Fourth World Conference on Women which would be held later in Beijing. Being a doctor, at first I had no idea about social indicators and rights. 
,  
I didn’t have a lot of expectations at that time. Although I didn’t always understand the discussions, I quickly figured out that this was a space I could use to talk about issues like uterine prolapse and sexual and reproductive rights that were not being discussed much. There were thousands of women there and I could broaden my network and learn from other women’s rights activists. 
,  
Several times my mother cried when people asked her, what is your daughter doing? These were times when I thought I had done something wrong. But preparing for the Beijing conference confirmed to me that I was on the right track after all. I was empowered by the process. 
,  
,  
There are some moments in history where everything gets accumulated and comes out. Beijing was like that. After a lot of advocacy and struggle by women’s rights groups, the Beijing Platform for Action was adopted. This was achieved by the power of networks and different groups and personalities working together from around the world at Beijing. 
,  
In Nepal, it was the very early days of activists being able to talk about democracy and women’s rights, and the Beijing conference was the place for these discussions. After the conference, the women’s ministry in Nepal was created. That’s what we were demanding and Beijing made it happen so that’s very significant. 
,  
But five years later the politics fizzled out. The political spirit of women’s rights movements became diluted and the Millennium Development Goals diluted the Beijing Platform for Action. Then gender mainstreaming replaced a lot of women’s rights issues. For example, in Nepal the gender mainstreaming projects were reduced to tokenistic gestures. The political and structural issues of women’s rights were not addressed and putting one woman here and one woman there does not mean equality. 
,  
Women’s rights activists brought out the issues at Beijing, but the severity of the issues got dissolved. 
,  
,  
When I started my work, I pulled out a rubber slipper from a woman’s vagina in a health camp. But after 20 years of so much energy and work on uterine prolapse and gender discrimination, I was doing a health camp recently and I pulled out a long piece of cloth from a woman that she was using to hold in her uterus – and she was only 10 km from a government hospital. Women’s rights activists brought out the issues at Beijing, but the severity of the issues got dissolved. Projects were designed but structural changes didn’t take place. 
,  
The UN meeting in March which is reviewing progress since the Beijing conference will be a time to reflect and see what we have achieved and take forward these achievements. But we need to be very careful about what has not worked around the globe. That’s why I want to be there and be part of this discussion on women’s rights 20 years later.

Today, a UN expert committee—the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) — released a strongly worded report stating that Canada was responsible for “grave violations” of human rights due its “protracted failure” to do enough to prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
,  
 
,  
,  
,  
,  
 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
The CEDAW report sets out 38 recommendations to address the marginalization and impoverishment putting Indigenous women at risk, ensuring effective and unbiased police responses, and proper support for affected families and communities. The Committee also called for an independent national inquiry and a comprehensive, coordinated national action plan. 
,  
Under international law, governments that fail to take all reasonable measures to prevent violence against women must bear some of the responsibility for the harm and suffering that results. 
,  
The CEDAW report marks the second time in two months that Canada’s failure to respond adequately to the staggeringly high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls has been sharply criticized by an international human rights body. 
,  
,  
In January 2015, a report released by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights acknowledged a number of initiatives already taken by the federal government and the province, but stated that such measures will not end the violence “unless the underlying factors of discrimination that originate and exacerbate the violence are also comprehensively addressed.” It urged governments in Canada to deal with “the persistence of longstanding social and economic marginalization through effective measures to combat poverty, improve education and employment, guarantee adequate housing and address the disproportionate application of criminal law against indigenous people.” The report called for nothing less than a comprehensive national response to violence against Indigenous women and girls, including an independent public inquiry. 
,  
Both reports were the product of investigations launched by these human rights bodies in response to formal complaints brought by the Native Women’s Association of Canada and the Feminist Alliance for International Action. Canada was given an opportunity to review and respond to the reports before they were made public. 
,  
,  
The reports of these investigations come on the heels of a May 2014 report by UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples James Anaya, which recommended a “comprehensive, nation-wide inquiry” into the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls, organized in consultation with Indigenous peoples in order to “provide an opportunity for the voices of the victims’ families to be heard, deepen understanding of the magnitude and systemic dimensions of the issue, and identify best practices that could lead to an adequately coordinated response.” 
,  
And this is on top of recommendations made to Canada as part of its Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in 2013 and previous missions by the UN Special Rapporteurs on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and on the Right to Housing. The issue has also previously been raised by the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and CEDAW. 
,  
And add to these the more than 700 recommendations made to government in 58 reports on the issue made in the past 20 years—most of which have been ignored by the federal government. 
,  
All these reports highlight the fact that violence against Indigenous women and girls is indeed a sociological problem that requires solutions that are much broader and more comprehensive than a public safety and community policing response. 
,  
The United Nations, the regional human rights body for the Western Hemisphere, all provincial and territorial governments, all national aboriginal organizations, major international human rights organizations, and Indigenous communities are all saying that the federal government’s approach is not adequate and that it’s not what is needed. 
,  
When will Canada hear the voices of people with lived experience and human rights experts from around the world and take meaningful action to protect the fundamental human rights of Indigenous women and girls to live free from discrimination and violence?

,  
After his first session of 50 lashes in front of a mosque in Jeddah on 9 January, a doctor advised prison authorities that his wounds had not healed sufficiently for him to undergo the second round of this brutal punishment. 
,  
The following Friday, while a medical committee had advised that Raif Badawi should not be flogged because of high blood pressure, another prison doctor insisted that there was nothing wrong with him and that he should be flogged. Then, for five consecutive weeks the Friday floggings were not carried out for reasons that remain unknown. It is anybody’s guess whether the next part of his sentence will be carried out tomorrow. 
,  
Raif Badawi has made headlines around the world. But his case is just the tip of the iceberg for the Gulf Kingdom’s appalling human rights record. Here are 10 sobering facts from Amnesty International’s research: 
,  
1. Cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments 
,  
Saudi Arabia’s courts continue to impose sentences of flogging as punishment for many offences, often following unfair trials. Besides Raif Badawi, in the past two years the human rights defenders Mikhlif bin Daham al-Shammari and Omar al-Sa’id were sentenced to 200 and 300 lashes, respectively, and Filipino domestic worker Ruth Cosrojas was sentenced to 300. Amputations and cross-amputations are also carried out as punishment for some crimes. 
,  
2. Spike in executions 
,  
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top executioners, with dozens of people being put to death annually, many in public beheadings. So far this year 40 people have been executed – almost four times the equivalent number for this time last year. 
,  
3. Crackdown on activists 
,  
Besides Raif Badawi, dozens more outspoken activists remain behind bars, simply for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. The authorities have targeted the small but vocal community of human rights defenders, including by using anti-terrorism laws to suppress their peaceful actions to expose and address human rights violations. 
,  
4. No space for dissent 
,  
All public gatherings, including demonstrations, remain prohibited under an order issued by the Interior Ministry in 2011. Those who defy the ban face arrest, prosecution and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the authorities”. 
,  
5. Systematic discrimination against women 
,  
Women and girls remain subject to discrimination in law and practice, with laws that subordinate their status to men, particularly in relation to family matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. Women who supported a campaign against a de facto ban on women drivers face the threat of arrest and other harassment and intimidation. 
,  
6. Routine torture in custody 
,  
Former detainees, trial defendants and others have told Amnesty International that the security forces’ use of torture and other ill-treatment remains common and widespread, and that those responsible are never brought to justice. 
,  
7. Arbitrary arrests and detentions 
,  
Scores of people have been arrested and detained in pre-trial detention for six months or more, which breaches the Kingdom’s own criminal codes. Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during their interrogation and denied access to their lawyers. Some human rights activists have been detained without charge or trial for more than two years. 
,  
8. Entrenched religious discrimination 
,  
Members of the Kingdom’s Shi’a minority, most of whom live in the oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face entrenched discrimination that limits their access to government services and employment. Shi’a activists have received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged participation in protests in 2011 and 2012. 
,  
9. Mass deportation of migrant workers 
,  
According to the Interior Ministry, a crackdown on irregular foreign migrant workers in November 2013 led to the deportation of more than 370,000 people. Some 18,000 were still being detained last March. Thousands of people were summarily returned to Somalia, Yemen or other states where they were at risk of human rights abuses. 
,  
10. What happens in the Kingdom, stays in the Kingdom 
,  
The Saudi Arabian authorities continue to deny access to independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International, and they have been known to take punitive action, including through the courts, against activists and family members of victims who contact us.

The following Friday, while a medical committee had advised that Raif Badawi should not be flogged because of high blood pressure, another prison doctor insisted that there was nothing wrong with him and that he should be flogged. Then, for five consecutive weeks the Friday floggings were not carried out for reasons that remain unknown. It is anybody’s guess whether the next part of his sentence will be carried out tomorrow. 
Raif Badawi has made headlines around the world. But his case is just the tip of the iceberg for the Gulf Kingdom’s appalling human rights record. Here are 10 sobering facts from Amnesty International’s research: 
1. Cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments 
Saudi Arabia’s courts continue to impose sentences of flogging as punishment for many offences, often following unfair trials. Besides Raif Badawi, in the past two years the human rights defenders Mikhlif bin Daham al-Shammari and Omar al-Sa’id were sentenced to 200 and 300 lashes, respectively, and Filipino domestic worker Ruth Cosrojas was sentenced to 300. Amputations and cross-amputations are also carried out as punishment for some crimes. 
2. Spike in executions 
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top executioners, with dozens of people being put to death annually, many in public beheadings. So far this year 40 people have been executed – almost four times the equivalent number for this time last year. 
3. Crackdown on activists 
Besides Raif Badawi, dozens more outspoken activists remain behind bars, simply for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. The authorities have targeted the small but vocal community of human rights defenders, including by using anti-terrorism laws to suppress their peaceful actions to expose and address human rights violations. 
4. No space for dissent 
All public gatherings, including demonstrations, remain prohibited under an order issued by the Interior Ministry in 2011. Those who defy the ban face arrest, prosecution and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the authorities”. 
5. Systematic discrimination against women 
Women and girls remain subject to discrimination in law and practice, with laws that subordinate their status to men, particularly in relation to family matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. Women who supported a campaign against a de facto ban on women drivers face the threat of arrest and other harassment and intimidation. 
6. Routine torture in custody 
Former detainees, trial defendants and others have told Amnesty International that the security forces’ use of torture and other ill-treatment remains common and widespread, and that those responsible are never brought to justice. 
7. Arbitrary arrests and detentions 
Scores of people have been arrested and detained in pre-trial detention for six months or more, which breaches the Kingdom’s own criminal codes. Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during their interrogation and denied access to their lawyers. Some human rights activists have been detained without charge or trial for more than two years. 
8. Entrenched religious discrimination 
Members of the Kingdom’s Shi’a minority, most of whom live in the oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face entrenched discrimination that limits their access to government services and employment. Shi’a activists have received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged participation in protests in 2011 and 2012. 
9. Mass deportation of migrant workers 
According to the Interior Ministry, a crackdown on irregular foreign migrant workers in November 2013 led to the deportation of more than 370,000 people. Some 18,000 were still being detained last March. Thousands of people were summarily returned to Somalia, Yemen or other states where they were at risk of human rights abuses. 
10. What happens in the Kingdom, stays in the Kingdom 
The Saudi Arabian authorities continue to deny access to independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International, and they have been known to take punitive action, including through the courts, against activists and family members of victims who contact us.

,  
Last month in El Salvador, a young woman walked free after nearly a decade behind bars. Carmen Guadalupe Vásquez Aldana was just 18 when, in 2008, she was sentenced to 30 years in jail. Her crime? Having a miscarriage. 
,  
El Salvador has one of the world’s most draconian abortion statutes. It criminalizes abortion on all grounds, including when the mother’s life or health is in danger, and in cases of rape. Women and girls cannot access an abortion even if continuing their pregnancy will kill them, or if their fetuses are not viable. 
,  
Those who defy the law and seek unsafe, clandestine abortions face horrifying consequences: The World Health Organization in 2008 reported that 9 percent of maternal deaths in Central America are due to such procedures. 
,  
Generally, wealthier Salvadorans can pay for private services or seek adequate medical care abroad. Most frequently, the law’s victims are patients in the country’s public clinics where doctors, fearing criminal prosecution, call the police when a woman arrives in pain. 
,  
This is what happened to Ms. Vásquez, whose lawyer, Dennis Muñoz, has characterized the abortion policy as a “witch hunt against poor women.” 
,  
El Salvador is extremely conservative, and the Catholic Church’s influence extends into political decision making. 
,  
In the 1990s, during the country’s fragile years of rebuilding after over a decade of civil war, a targeted church campaign led to the implementation, in 1998, of the total ban. 
,  
Today, church power operates alongside a well-funded and well-connected lobby that campaigns against abortion rights, and a press that is quick to accuse women who miscarry of being criminals. The few politicians who have criticized the ban have faced a public backlash. 
,  
Ms. Vásquez became pregnant after being raped. When she miscarried and was taken to a hospital in San Salvador, the capital, her doctors accused her of having intentionally terminated her pregnancy. 
,  
Despite the paucity of evidence against her, she was convicted of aggravated homicide, and imprisoned. 
,  
Her case is hardly unique. According to the Agrupación Ciudadana por la Despenalización del Aborto (Citizens’ Coalition for the Decriminalization of Abortion), an El Salvador-based advocacy group, 129 women were prosecuted for abortion-related crimes in the country between 2000 and 2011. Of these, 23 were convicted of receiving an illegal abortion; 26 were convicted of homicide. 
,  
Ms. Vásquez is herself just one of 17 women (“Las 17”) who between 1999 and 2011 were sentenced to up to 40 years in jail following reported miscarriages, most on charges of aggravated homicide. (While no official statistics are available, Amnesty International estimates that at least five more women currently await sentencing on similar pregnancy-related charges.) 
,  
In April, “Las 17” became the focus of a global campaign when, after years of effort and having exhausted all other legal remedies, their lawyers requested a presidential pardon. 
,  
Last year I visited Ilopango prison, the all-female facility just outside San Salvador where Ms. Vásquez and most of the other members of “Las 17” were incarcerated. 
,  
As is characteristic of El Salvador jails, Ilopango is squalid and cramped: Overcrowding stands at nearly 1,000 percent, according to some estimates. Women sleep some 40 to a cell; one prison guard told me that over 100 children under five live there with their mothers. 
,  
In January, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly granted Ms. Vásquez’s pardon, on grounds that due process had been violated in her original trial. Additional cases will be brought in the coming months. 
,  
While Ms. Vásquez’s victory is encouraging, many are anticipating a backlash from the Assembly. (Though no official statement has been made by El Salvador, it has been suggested to Amnesty that no further pardons will be approved.) 
,  
The Agrupación Ciudadana por la Despenalización del Aborto, and activists like Morena Herrera, who with Colectiva Feminista, an El Salvador-based organization, has for years been fighting the abortion ban, are exploring legal avenues for freeing the remaining members of “Las 17” should their pardons be rejected. 
,  
One option may be to take their cases to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in Washington. Amnesty will soon present a petition with over 200,000 signatures to President Salvador Sánchez Cerén, urging him to overturn the abortion laws. 
,  
Five other Latin American countries have similar abortion bans, including Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname. 
,  
Of these, Chile is taking steps to rectify its statutes: In January, President Michelle Bachelet presented her Congress with a draft bill that would permit abortion when a mother’s life is at risk; if a fetus will not survive; or in cases of rape. If passed, the bill would reverse that country’s total abortion ban, implemented in 1989. And in December the Dominican Republic decriminalized abortion in cases of rape, incest, fetal impairment or when the mother’s life is at risk. 
,  
Hopefully these actions will exert pressure on El Salvadoran lawmakers to re-examine and overhaul their country’s repressive abortion ban. 
,  
Ms. Vásquez’s exoneration is a victory in the long fight for women’s rights in Latin America, but there is much to be done. El Salvador must end its excessive practice of criminalizing women’s sexual and reproductive health and decisions, and free the members of “Las 17” who remain unfairly imprisoned for suffering miscarriages. Their nightmare cannot end soon enough.

Last week, the National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls brought together family members of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, national Aboriginal organizations (NAOs), and representatives from the federal, provincial and territorial governments to Ottawa to discuss the need for action to combat the staggeringly high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls. Provinces, territories, and all NAOs are on record as supporting an independent inquiry into the issue.

At the end of the one-day roundtable, the federal government remained adamantly opposed to an independent national inquiry. Participants agreed to work on an awareness campaign and committed to holding another roundtable, this time hosted in Manitoba, by the end of 2016. Roundtable participants agreed to coordinate efforts on policing, community safety and crime prevention, but this commitment continues to fall far short of the comprehensive, coordinated national response long called for by Indigenous women’s organizations and human rights groups. See roundtable news release for more information. 
,  
Better policing and community safety measures are important, but they are not enough. The root causes of violence that put Indigenous women and girls in harm’s way need to be addressed. An alarming study released in advance of the roundtable showed that the federal government has dismissed or ignored analysis and recommendations that address the root causes of violence. Fifty eight reports on the issue of violence against Indigenous women have been produced over the past 20 years; only a handful of the more than 700 recommendations in these reports have been fully implemented. 
,  
,  
On the eve of the roundtable, federal Status of Women Minister Kellie Leitch told the Globe and Mail that the federal government was prepared to move ahead with some new initiatives on anti-violence programs directed at Indigenous men. Minister Leitch said, “We have a good sense of the individuals who are perpetuating these crimes.” In other words, the government has defined the issue as Indigenous men carrying out acts of violence against Indigenous women and girls and is only prepared to consider actions that fit that frame. 
,  
So who are the perpetrators of violence against Indigenous women and girls? A May 2014 report released by the RCMP on violence against Indigenous women and girls does not identify how many of the perpetrators are Indigenous or non-Indigenous. But we know from individual cases that attacks on Indigenous women are carried out by Indigenous and non-Indigenous men alike. 
,  
The vast majority of murders are committed by someone known to the victim. This is true for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. 
,  
The statistics published by the RCMP show that Indigenous women are 3.5 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be murdered by a spouse or family member and 7 times more likely to be murdered by an acquaintance—this could be a friend, neighbour, colleague, or another man who is not an intimate partner of the victims—the Aboriginal identity of such acquaintances is not known. (These numbers are derived from the RCMP report but not published by the RCMP.) 
,  
Regardless of the Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal identity of the perpetrator, or their relationship to the victim, attacks on Indigenous women take place in a social context in which discrimination, marginalization and impoverishment help put Indigenous women in harm’s way, deny Indigenous women the opportunity to escape violence, or even encourage some men to feel that they can get away with acts of violence and hatred against them. 
,  
,  
Minister Leitch’s framing of the issue is incorrect and dangerous. And it points once again to the increasingly urgent need for an independent public inquiry to ensure that the policies and programs that make up a national action plan on violence against women are based on a clear, unbiased understanding of the issues, and help hold government accountable for acting on the recommendations brought forward by affected families, communities and Indigenous peoples’ organizations. 
,  
Indigenous women’s organizations and human rights groups have long said that the shocking levels of violence faced by First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls requires nothing less than a comprehensive, coordinated national response to ensure effective, unbiased police investigations, to support the families of those who have been murdered or gone missing, and to address the factors putting Indigenous women in harm’s way in the first place. The roundtable does not change this call to action. Anything less than a comprehensive national response, informed by an independent public inquiry, a failure to Indigenous women and girls.

There is so much packed into the government’s current national security law reform, it is hard to know where to focus.  Bills C-44 and C-51, currently before Parliament, constitute the most substantial and controversial overhaul of Canada’s national security landscape since the 2001 terrorist attacks. 
,  
The weeks to come will see much debate about the human rights consequences of CSIS’ unprecedented new powers to act to reduce security threats and to apply for Federal Court warrants authorizing Charter violations as part of that process.  
,  
There will be discussion of the vagueness of the new criminal offence of advocating or promoting the commission of terrorism offences in general and the certainty that this will both intrude on and chill free expression in the country.  
,  
Indigenous peoples, environmental activists, human rights campaigners and others will worry that the new measures only protect “lawful” advocacy, dissent and protest, an intentional retrenching from current laws that recognize that protests that are not lawful in the sense of having a City Hall permit are nonetheless not criminal, are protected under the Charter and should not, by any twisted interpretation, be lumped in with terrorism. 
,  
The stunningly expansive new definition of threats to Canada’s security which guides the new information sharing legislation, a definition which places terrorism down the list at number four, will also attract much attention. 
,  
Among the many worrying issues, there is one that is not only troubling but deeply ironic. 
,  
Bill C-44 and Bill C-51 both establish that CSIS can be active outside Canada, a dramatic departure from the agency’s mandate which has always been limited to operating within the country.  Bill C-44 opens that up with respect to investigating threats to Canada’s security.  Bill C-51 extends that authorization to act outside of Canada to new powers for CSIS to disrupt and reduce threats to Canada’s security. 
,  
Other than expressly excluding acts that would result in death, bodily harm, perversion of justice or violations of sexual integrity, there are no limits to these threat reduction powers.  Acts that violate the Charter are explicitly anticipated, as long as a Federal Court judge gives thumbs up. 
,  
The prospect of Federal Court judges approving Charter violations turns democratic governance and the rule of law on its head.  The judiciary is the guardian of constitutional documents like the Charter, expected to red light, not green light, violations. 
,  
Whether or not these new powers to act outside Canada are advisable, necessary, legal or likely to be effective I will leave aside for the moment. 
,  
Attracting less attention in the debate is that in C-44 and C-51 Federal Court judges are explicitly told that warrants allowing CSIS to act outside Canada to investigate threats or take proactive steps to reduce threats should be granted “without regard to any other law, including that of any foreign state”.  
,  
Judges will authorize CSIS action in other countries even if it violates that country’s law – any law, seemingly including their constitution.  In fact they are told they should not even pay attention to local law. 
,  
It takes me back to 2007-2008, when Amnesty International, along with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, challenged the Canadian military’s practice of transferring prisoners in Afghanistan to the Afghan secret police, despite overwhelming evidence of the risk of torture.  
,  
The government argued strenuously that the Charter of Rights, the legal basis of the claim, did not apply to Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.  Instead it was of paramount importance that local Afghan laws govern and be respected.  The Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal agreed with that position and the Supreme Court, unfortunately, declined to hear a final appeal. 
,  
Here is the irony.  When Canadian law, notably the Charter, stood to offer important human rights protection, the government’s view was that local law must have the final word and Canadian law be disregarded.  
,  
Now, in a context where local laws might limit the actions of Canadian intelligence officials, including by safeguarding human rights, the opposite applies.  Local law should play no part and Canadian law must rule. 
,  
There’s an old adage about not being able to have one’s cake and eat it too.   But that’s not how best to protect human rights.

Indigenous peoples, environmental activists, human rights campaigners and others will worry that the new measures only protect “lawful” advocacy, dissent and protest, an intentional retrenching from current laws that recognize that protests that are not lawful in the sense of having a City Hall permit are nonetheless not criminal, are protected under the Charter and should not, by any twisted interpretation, be lumped in with terrorism. 
The stunningly expansive new definition of threats to Canada’s security which guides the new information sharing legislation, a definition which places terrorism down the list at number four, will also attract much attention. 
Among the many worrying issues, there is one that is not only troubling but deeply ironic. 
Bill C-44 and Bill C-51 both establish that CSIS can be active outside Canada, a dramatic departure from the agency’s mandate which has always been limited to operating within the country.  Bill C-44 opens that up with respect to investigating threats to Canada’s security.  Bill C-51 extends that authorization to act outside of Canada to new powers for CSIS to disrupt and reduce threats to Canada’s security. 
Other than expressly excluding acts that would result in death, bodily harm, perversion of justice or violations of sexual integrity, there are no limits to these threat reduction powers.  Acts that violate the Charter are explicitly anticipated, as long as a Federal Court judge gives thumbs up. 
The prospect of Federal Court judges approving Charter violations turns democratic governance and the rule of law on its head.  The judiciary is the guardian of constitutional documents like the Charter, expected to red light, not green light, violations. 
Whether or not these new powers to act outside Canada are advisable, necessary, legal or likely to be effective I will leave aside for the moment. 
Attracting less attention in the debate is that in C-44 and C-51 Federal Court judges are explicitly told that warrants allowing CSIS to act outside Canada to investigate threats or take proactive steps to reduce threats should be granted “without regard to any other law, including that of any foreign state”.  
Judges will authorize CSIS action in other countries even if it violates that country’s law – any law, seemingly including their constitution.  In fact they are told they should not even pay attention to local law. 
It takes me back to 2007-2008, when Amnesty International, along with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, challenged the Canadian military’s practice of transferring prisoners in Afghanistan to the Afghan secret police, despite overwhelming evidence of the risk of torture.  
The government argued strenuously that the Charter of Rights, the legal basis of the claim, did not apply to Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.  Instead it was of paramount importance that local Afghan laws govern and be respected.  The Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal agreed with that position and the Supreme Court, unfortunately, declined to hear a final appeal. 
Here is the irony.  When Canadian law, notably the Charter, stood to offer important human rights protection, the government’s view was that local law must have the final word and Canadian law be disregarded.  
Now, in a context where local laws might limit the actions of Canadian intelligence officials, including by safeguarding human rights, the opposite applies.  Local law should play no part and Canadian law must rule. 
There’s an old adage about not being able to have one’s cake and eat it too.   But that’s not how best to protect human rights.

‘Every border you cross, every purchase you make, every call you dial, every cell phone tower you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site you visit… is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not.’
Edward Snowden, CITIZENFOUR 
In June 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the shocking extent of government spy networks across the world. The documents he released laid bare how governments are using illegal, mass surveillance to collect, store and analyse millions of people’s private communications around the world. 
It is almost two years since Snowden’s first disclosures. CITIZENFOUR, the powerful film directed by Laura Poitras, documents those tense days when the revelations first hit, with Snowden confined to his hotel room as the storm erupts. On Saturday the film was awarded an Oscar for best documentary 2014. 
The film lays out the case against mass surveillance in brilliant and terrifying detail and the need to bring government surveillance powers back within the law. 
For those who haven’t watched it yet, here are 5 reasons why you should care about what Snowden revealed to the world. 
1. Mass surveillance treats us all like criminals
The Snowden files show our governments are hoovering up every private communication we make and every trace of digital data we leave behind. 
When they do that, they abandon long-standing principles of law which says that surveillance must be targeted, based on sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, and authorised by a strictly independent authority, such as a judge. Instead, they’re treating us all as criminal suspects, guilty until proven innocent, and every detail of our personal lives as suspicious. 
2. Mass surveillance doesn’t help catch terrorists
Our politicians keep saying they need more spying powers so they can catch terrorists. But there isn’t any evidence that mass surveillance will help them. 
Before the attacks in Paris, the security services identified the suspects but then ruled them out. No amount of our personal data would have made up for this. The truth is that governments are gathering information that they couldn’t have dreamed of a decade ago. And they will always tell us they need more. There need to be limitations set. 
3. Mass surveillance does away with fundamental rights
Right now, our governments are selling us a false choice – safety or freedom. 
Societies have had to balance these two things for centuries, and have solid rules to protect people. This means we presume people are innocent until proven guilty. That they have the right to privacy. And that governments need to suspect someone has done something wrong before restricting their freedom. 
These are the things that proponents of mass surveillance systems want to do away with. 
4. Mass surveillance can be used to control what we do
I’ve spoken to people who say: “If you’ve done nothing wrong, you’ve got nothing to hide”. But that puts huge trust in our leaders to do the right thing. 
The government is granting itself the power to look into every person’s personal life whenever they like. Those are formidable powers and they are ripe for abuse. We already know that this private data can be used to target journalists, persecute activists, profile and disciminate against minorties and crack down on free speech. 
We need to start thinking: ‘if not me now, who?’, ‘If not today, what about the future?’ 
5. Mass surveillance threatens free speech online
When it was founded, the internet was seen as a space where open debate could flourish. Today, that vision is under attack. Governments want us to accept that we don’t have rights when we’re online. That somehow, when I pull out my smartphone or sign in to my email, everything I do or say belongs to them. 
We wouldn’t allow this level of intrusion into our offline lives, so let’s not stand for it online. 
Get involved: Over the coming months, look out for more from us on this issue and how you can get involved in fighting back against unlawful mass surveillance. For more information on how to gte involved in Canada, contact Hilary Homes at Amnesty’s naional office: hhomes@amnesty.ca.

We have had ample, tragic reminders in Canada of just how vulnerable human rights are when national security – real or overstated – is at stake. The consequences have been wrenching, including torture, disappearance, arbitrary arrest, unfair trials and discrimination. In all instances the lack of meaningful review and oversight was starkly evident, leaving troubling unanswered questions. Might probing oversight have prevented the abuses? Might stronger review process have led to accountability for what went wrong and deterred similar injustices?

In the absence of accessible and genuine review and oversight, individuals who have suffered national security-related human rights harms have instead turned to expensive, cumbersome and protracted judicial inquiries and lawsuits. That is hardly sustainable and certainly not fair.

Maher Arar was subject to extraordinary rendition from New York City to Syria by US authorities in the middle of the night in September 2002. He disappeared for two weeks, was brutally tortured and was never brought to trial during the year he was held in inhuman prison conditions in Damascus. In the end a judicial inquiry, presided by former Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Dennis O’Connor for over two years, unravelled the sorry chain of events beginning in Canada which led to all of the abuses.

Ahmad Abou-Elmaati, Abdullah Almalki and Muayyed Nureddin all suffered from a Canadian version of extraordinary rendition. Well-timed, selective, inaccurate and inflammatory intelligence was shared by Canadian officials with Syrian counterparts when those men travelled to Syria in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. Again, vicious torture, gruelling prison conditions and unlawful detention followed. And once again it took a thorough judicial inquiry, this time presided by former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Frank Iacobucci, to get to the bottom of the cases and catalogue the long list of deficient Canadian action and inaction that made it all possible. 
,  
For Omar Khadr it has meant winding through multiple levels of the Canadian court system, ending up twice at the Supreme Court of Canada (a third SCC appeal is scheduled for May of this year). The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that Canadian officials have been complicit in the violations Omar Khadr endured in US custody at Guantánamo Bay. But there has been no remedy for those violations. 
,  
Other cases are mired in protracted and contentious lawsuits. While Maher Arar has received an apology and redress for the wrongs documented in his judicial inquiry; the government has refused to follow suit for Elmaati, Almalki and Nurredin, despite Justice Iacobucci’s numerous findings of wrongdoing. Instead their case is bogged down in the courts.

Similarly for Abousfian Abdelrazik, seeking answers and compensation for the role CSIS played in his detention and torture in the Sudan; and for Benamar Benatta, who is looking for truth and redress for the unlawful actions of Canadian immigration officials who sent him across the border into the hands of US officials on September 12, 2001, launching a five year nightmare of arbitrary imprisonment and abuse. They are both lost in lawsuits that have stretched on already for several years. The same is the case for Hassan Almrei and Adil Charkaoui, who have sought accountability for years of injustice they endured while subject to immigration security certificates. 
,  
All of these men have had nowhere else to turn for answers and action while they were in the midst of experiencing human rights violations in Syria, Egypt, Sudan, the United States, Guantánamo Bay or Canada. And there has been no easy route to accountability and redress after the fact. 
,  
Notably, when Justice O’Connor was given his mandate for the Arar Inquiry in 2004, he was specifically asked to make recommendations with respect to reviewing the national security activities of the RCMP. His comprehensive report was released in December 2006 with clear conclusions: national security review in Canada was woefully inadequate. 
,  
Justice O’Connor determined that with “enhanced information sharing, new legal powers and responsibilities, and increased integration in national security policing” it was time for an overhaul to the approach taken to review of the RCMP and the numerous other agencies and government departments involved in national security. His model includes ensuring that all agencies and departments are subject to review, review powers have real teeth and integration across all the review bodies to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks in a world where the agencies and departments involved in national security increasingly carry out their work in a seamlessly interconnected fashion.

At least 77 people died as a result of clashes between police and protesters at Kyiv’s EuroMaydan roughly a year ago and another 1,000 were severely injured. 
,  
These numbers may sound like dull statistics, but for me they were transformed into real individual stories of injustice as I attended launch of Amnesty International’s report: A year after EuroMaydan, justice delayed, justice denied in Kiev this morning. One of the most outspoken victims of police violence at EuroMaydan – Vladyslav Tsilytskiy – was present at the report launch. 
,  
Fighting for justice 
,  
Vladyslav, a 23 year-old computer programmer, came to central Kyiv on 20 January 2014 to join others who were peacefully protesting against systematic human rights abuses, corruption and a host of draconian laws adopted three days earlier. This day witnessed one of the heaviest police crackdowns on the protesters. Valdyslav was captured by members of the riot police force, Berkut. The Berkut officers handcuffed Vladyslav, beat him, grabbed his face and dragged him by the lips and sprayed tear gas on his genitals. His beating by police was recorded on a video. 
,  
Vladyslav lodged a complaint about his ill-treatment, but as other victims of police abuse in EuroMaydan, he has never been questioned as a victim, and has received no information about the investigation into his complaint. 
,  
Out of hundreds of victims of violence at EuroMaydan, many have remained silent. I asked Vladyslav why he spoke out. He replied that his fight is all about justice. “Requesting justice is the minimum I can do. I have hardly seen any results so far, but I am not going to give up. I am watching the video of my beatings over and over again to keep the anger alive so that I keep fighting for justice.” 
,  
Maydan today 
,  
After the press conference I walked to Maydan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), or simply “Maydan”, a square that was the battleground between police and protesters a year ago. Maydan is now all cleared from debris and looks like a typical central square of a European capital with opulent buildings and shiny statues of the city’s founders and medieval heroes. 
,  
Maydan is also filled with the memorial stands of modern Ukrainian heroes: the victims who sacrificed themselves at EuroMaydan for a better future in Ukraine at EuroMaydan. People are approaching their pictures, lighting up candles and praying. 
,  
No excuse for delaying justice 
,  
Some 600 kilometres east of the Maydan, the Ukrainian government’s main challenge is persisting: the recently signed Minsk agreement seems fragile with the fighting still ongoing between the pro-Russian separatists and pro-Kyiv forces in the town of Debaltseve. During my stay in Kyiv the representatives of civil society told me that the government uses the conflict as an excuse whenever accused of delaying justice for EuroMaydan, along with other internal problems, such as lack of capacity and resources of Ukrainian public bodies. 
,  
This week Kyiv is preparing for anniversary events to commemorate the EuroMaydan victims. The government installed a special stage on Maydan where the commemorative concert will be held and officials will make speeches. 
,  
I believe the best way for Ukraine to commemorate its lost heroes is to uphold those values for which the killed protesters sacrificed their lives, by investigating the EuroMaydan violence and bringing those accountable to justice. A year on, there should be no excuse for delayed justice. 
,  
Ukrainian activism survives 
,  
At the end of Amnesty International’s report launch, journalists got hold of Vladyslav to interview him. When asked if EuroMaydan was worth all the suffering, he unhesitatingly replied: “Yes, definitely, it was worth it. I would do the same again.”

,  
The messages that arrived in my inbox could not be ignored! They were bursting with positive emotion as they told of an important victory over injustice in Mexico. 
,  
The texts were sent by Claudia Medina, a woman whose experience of torture and persecution had so moved me and other members of an Amnesty Canada delegation that visited Mexico last September. 
,  
When we met Claudia five months ago, she was living with the traumatic scars of what was done to her while she was detained at a naval base in 2012: the beatings, the hot peppers forced up her nose, the electric shocks, the sexual assault. Her torturers added psychological torture, threatening to rape her with a metal bar and bring in her children to the torture chamber unless Claudia “confessed” to involvement in an armed, criminal gang. 
,  
Not surprisingly, Claudia signed the “confession” she was not allowed to read and hung her head as she was presented as a dangerous criminal at a press conference by security forces anxious to show results in its “war on drugs”. 
,  
When she was finally taken to court, Claudia retracted the statement she had been forced to sign and informed the court about how she had been tortured. Some of the charges against her were dropped but she was still charged with the serious crime of carrying an illegal weapon. Claudia was released on bail pending the outcome of judicial proceedings against her. 
,  
Claudia and her children remained under a weight of unrelenting fear. Security forces had claimed in their evidence to the prosecutor to have arrested her in possession of firearms with an armed gang. Claudia knew only too well that all-too-often justice officials in Mexico rely on fabricated evidence, along with “admissions” extracted under torture. 
,  
But now five months later, as her excited words appeared on my screen, Claudia had fantastic news to share. The charges against her have now all been thrown out. For Claudia, most important of all is the vindication that she was speaking the truth when she denied committing the crimes of which she was accused. 
,  
,  
This is a victory for Claudia, her family, her legal team and the thousands of Amnesty supporters who added their signatures to a petition to Mexico’s Attorney General. 
,  
,  
Claudia asked me to share another thank you. “When we met last September, you brought me a beautiful banner with messages of solidarity from Canada,” she wrote. “I hung it on the wall across from my bed and I would look at it when I was feeling really down amidst so much injustice. Please tell everyone that it has given me the strength to carry on seeing that I have your support.” 
,  
,  
Last September, Amnesty International Canada’s Secretary General Alex Neve met with Ángel Amílcar Colón in a jail in northern Mexico where he had languished in pre-trial detention for 5 years after being tortured into “confessing” to crimes he too had not committed. Amnesty International rallied around Ángel, declaring him a prisoner of conscience and mobilizing supporters to raise their voices to call for his release. In October, Ángel was set free unconditionally. The Attorney General agreed to drop the fabricated charges against him. 
,  
Dropping unfair charges against Ángel Amílcar Colón and Claudia Medina are necessary, positive, welcome steps. But there is no doubt that much more is needed. Torture is a crime in Mexico. Yet both Ángel and Claudia are still waiting for Mexican authorities to respond to their denunciations and bring to justice the state agents who subjected them to torture. Only this will send the message that torture will no longer be tolerated in Mexico. Only this will protect others from the horror that Ángel and Claudia suffered. 
,  
,  
It’s a just dream that can come true, if we all speak up to make it a reality.

Ebola has affected every area of life in Sierra Leone, and made it even more challenging for pregnant women to get the care they desperately need. Activist Fatou Wurie talks about her personal experiences of maternal health care there.  
,  
I want to tell you about a young girl I met two years ago. I walked into a community health centre expecting to meet 50 traditional birth attendants for a training seminar. Instead, I walked into a labour ward and saw a placenta discarded on the floor. A young mother was bleeding and in tears, and her new-born baby boy was fighting against the odds to live. 
,  
The midwives in their neon pink uniforms asked me to help clean the mother up while they resuscitated the baby. I didn’t ask questions, but mechanically helped the mother clean up and calm down. The new-born was still not breathing, his airway was blocked and the small health centre did not have the equipment they needed to save his life. 
,  
Eventually, I took the baby to the nearest town hospital and the mother soon followed. Grateful, she cried as she watched her child sleep safely – for the first time since his birth – in a neonatal incubator. This experience altered my perspective forever. It was then that I truly understood what being helpless looked like. But I also understood that, with the right resources, lives can be saved. 
,  
,  
Today, pregnant women across Sierra Leone are still struggling to get the health care they need. Seven women die every day due to maternal complications, and one baby dies every hour. That makes 9,000 new-born deaths every year. Unfortunately, since Ebola has hit, the use of routine maternal and new-born health services has declined. 
,  
Ebola has placed a huge strain on our already weakened health care system. Right now, clinics are suffering from a lack of equipment, drugs and workers. Many health care centres are only treating Ebola cases. 
, 	What’s more, the disease creates fear between health care workers and patients. Deaths of health workers and Ebola patients have scared many women away from seeking medical help. Fever and bleeding, common during pregnancy, are also symptoms of Ebola, so health workers are reluctant to treat and admit pregnant women. A young pregnant mother’s chance of surviving childbirth still remains far too slim. It does not have to be this way. 
,  
,  
A couple of weeks ago I accompanied burial teams to collect the body of a still-born baby at a military hospital in Freetown. Together with the father, we took the body to the cemetery, which has been newly expanded for children and new-borns. We found too many tiny graves, some freshly dug, others closed and neatly organised as “un-known, new-borns”. Far too many were labelled “stillbirths”. 
,  
I wondered about the increase in stillbirths. Was it due to the decline in antenatal visits – making women more susceptible to infection during childbirth? The truth is, we don’t know. But we do know that far too many mothers and babies are dying from preventable causes. And that’s because people are staying away from health facilities due to myths about catching Ebola and a decrease in the quality of health care. 
,  
,  
This is why I work with MamaYe, a campaign that focuses on the survival of mothers and babies in Sierra Leone and five other African countries. MamaYe strives to ensure that communities have adequate and safe health clinics. In order for a clinic to be safe, it must have basics such as safe running water, good sanitation, consistent electricity, skilled birth attendants and drugs. 
,  
This has never been more necessary than during this time of Ebola. As the outbreak continues to hit communities hard, our government and donors need to build up Sierra Leone’s health care system, especially for mothers and babies. Every time we lose a baby that dies before they see their first birthday, we lose a potential leader, doer, activist or citizen who can shape our country’s future.

,  
,  
Pretty shocking. Boko Haram’s bloody onslaught in north-east Nigeria and the military’s heavy-handed response has killed thousands of civilians and forced hundreds of thousands to flee. Women, men and children live in constant fear of murder and abduction by Boko Haram and of arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention, torture and even execution at the hands of the military. 
,  
	But it is not just the violence in the north-east of the country that is extremely worrying. The problems within Nigeria’s justice system, for example, are deeply entrenched. 
,  
68% of the 55,000 people held in Nigeria’s overcrowded prisons have been convicted but have been waiting, many for years, for their cases to conclude. Those who have been convicted often faced grossly unfair trials – with many having suffered torture and lacking access to a lawyer. More than a thousand people are currently languishing on death row, awaiting the day when the State decides to kill them. Ironically, those who commit human rights violations rarely face prosecution. 
,  
Poverty and inequality are also major issues, with millions of people lacking access to adequate housing, being forcibly evicted from their homes and even lacking drinking water.   
,  
Around the Niger Delta, entire communities live at the mercy of unscrupulous oil companies who have polluted their land, devastating the environment that people depend on for food, water and livelihoods. Oil spills caused by both aging pipelines and illegal activity such as oil theft are notorious and endemic, but the companies do not clean up properly, if at all. 
,  
,  
The armed group Boko Haram is responsible for much of the violence and death that has rocked large parts of Nigeria. 
,  
Since the group first began its campaign of violence after the police killed the group’s leader in an extrajudicial execution in 2009, they have lead a merciless campaign of killings and horror – with at least 350 raids and bombings between 2013 and 2014 killing at least 5,400 civilians. 
,  
But Boko Haram’s rise reflects the multiple problems faced by modern Nigeria – including poverty. The group is known to have recruited marginalized young men, sometimes by force.   
,  
Once again, the lack of justice for crimes under international law and other serious violations and abuses of human rights is a major problem. Just as the government has failed to hold its own forces to account, it has prosecuted very few people suspected of being members or supporters of Boko Haram for crimes under international law and other serious abuses of human rights, such as torture. 
,  
,  
The 276 schoolgirls kidnaped last April from the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School are some of the victims of Boko Haram ruthless campaign against secular authority and institutions in Nigeria. 
,  
While some of the girls escaped from their captors, 219 are still missing. 
,  
In videos posted online, Boko Haram’s leader Abubakar Shekau claimed the group had forced the girls into marriage but, so far, no one has been able to confirm what has happened to them. 
,  
,  
The problem in Nigeria is not the lack of laws. Actually, since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has signed up to a number of international treaties designed to protect people’s human rights. Even the country’s constitution guarantees people’s basic rights. 
,  
While Nigeria is yet to criminalize torture and has other important gaps in its laws, it is clear that one of the biggest problems the country faces is the failure to respect and enforce those laws that already exist. For example, despite constitutional guarantees, people are denied access to their lawyers and families while in military detention, the police do not charge or release suspects within constitutionally-mandated time limits and the government fails to enforce environmental regulations on oil companies. 
,  
,  
The government claims they are trying to stop Boko Haram and make people in the country safe. They have also promised to end human rights violations by security forces and to make international human rights treaties part of national laws, including by criminalizing torture.   
,  
In reality, however, the problem is that those responsible for human rights violations, including members of the military and police, are rarely held to account, sending the message that they can get away with it. 
,  
Despite an official stance by the authorities that human rights violations by the military and police in Nigeria happen because of a few “bad eggs”, evidence shows that the problems are systematic. 
,  
,  
There are some steps authorities could, and should, take without delay. These include: initiating a thorough plan to reform the police force and the justice sector, imposing a moratorium on executions with a view to ultimately abolishing the death penalty and introducing a law to establish safeguards against forced evictions. 
,  
Improving the human rights situation in Nigeria requires political will. Some of the changes will need financial investment others just implementation and enforcement of existing legislation and regulations.   
,  
,  
Tensions in Nigeria are running high and, sadly, the country has a history of election-related violence. It is important that candidates, the government and the security forces respect human rights during the elections and beyond. 
,  
Leaders and candidates must refrain from inflammatory campaign rhetoric and the government and security forces must do all in their power to ensure the protection of civilians and the respect for human rights before, during and after the elections. 
,  
,  
We are urging the new government to put human rights at the top of its agenda in order to break Nigeria’s nationwide cycle of violence. 
,  
The new government must initiate independent, impartial and thorough investigations into allegations of crimes under international law, including crimes against humanity and war crimes, committed by members of Boko Haram and the Nigerian military. They should also take immediate measures to guarantee the safety, security and protection of civilians and their property in the communities affected by the ongoing violence. 
,  
Beyond the areas of conflict, the government must take robust measures to stamp out torture, including by criminalising it and bringing all those responsible for committing it to justice. Authorities must also halt all forced evictions and ensure people do not live under the constant threat of losing their homes.

,  
I have seen Claudia Medina cry many times. 
,  
She cried when she told me about the torture, including sexual abuse, she suffered at the hands of Mexican marines in 2012. She also cried when she explained what it is like to live with federal charges pending over her head, accused of being a member of a criminal gang, facing the risk of being arrested again at any time. Then once more when she told me about how her children were suffering. 
,  
But today is the first time I have seen her cry out of joy and relief. A judge has just dropped the last remaining charge against her, arguing that the sole piece of evidence – a report filed by the marines – is a lie. 
,  
The judge confirmed that after her arrest Claudia was tortured and sexually assaulted by marines in order to force her to incriminate herself and others in drug-related crimes. The offences took place on 7 August 2012 at a Navy barracks in Veracruz state, Eastern Mexico. 
,  
“For two years I have lived with the accusations made against me which were based on the torture they inflicted on me. It has been very hard. At the beginning I used to see all this as a monster standing in front of me, something I thought I was not going to be able to overcome,” said Claudia. 
,  
“This affected me personally because everybody turned their backs on me. I was also unable to be a mum for my children 100 per cent. I was affected financially. I was not able to give my children what they were used to having and what they needed.” 
,  
On 6 February a judge informed her that the last remaining charge against her for illegal weapon possession had been dropped. 
,  
“I feel a lot calmer now,” Claudia said just before a press conference hosted by Amnesty International in Mexico City. 
,  
“I’m now going to be able to travel around with much more freedom. Before, I used to walk thinking that I was going to be detained and tortured like before. But not anymore. I will hold my head high and say ‘I’m innocent and I have always told the truth’.” 
,  
But Claudia’s struggle for justice is far from over. 
,  
“My torture complaint is now with the Federal Attorney General’s Office. There have not been any advances but I will persist with this.” 
,  
The federal prosecutors say Claudia has to actively reconfirm that she would like to continue with the judicial investigation into her accusations of torture. This is outrageous. Torture is an extremely serious crime and authorities have the obligation to promptly investigate any complaints as soon as they are filed. 
,  
This approach to justice shows how impunity is perpetuated. According to official figures, Mexico has only achieved seven torture convictions at the federal level since 1991; this despite the widely documented use of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies and the armed forces across the country. 
,  
Last September, Amnesty International launched a report as part of its global Stop Torture Campaign looking at the substantial rise in the number of reported torture cases in the past decade and the incredibly few investigations carried out. 
,  
Its findings are backed up by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other ill-treatment, who recently visited Mexico and defined the use of torture there as “widespread”. 
,  
One of the reasons for the lack of justice is the failure of the Federal Attorney General’s Office to carry out forensic medical examinations of possible victims in a prompt, adequate and impartial manner, as mandated by the UN-backed Istanbul Protocol which sets out guidelines for investigating torture allegations. 
,  
This was the case with Claudia. She was left with no choice but to reach out to independent forensic experts from a local NGO and from the National Human Rights Commission. Both their reports prove that Claudia’s allegations are consistent with her physical and psychological scars. 
,  
It remains to be seen whether the General Attorney’s Office will ever accept these independent medical examinations or if those who tortured Claudia will be brought to justice. 
,  
But despite all the challenges, Claudia has a positive outlook for the future. 
,  
“After this long process I had to go through I felt the need to become a human rights activist, to show that I’m not a criminal, as authorities portrayed me. 
,  
I will not allow even one more woman to be tortured in Mexico.” 
,  
Please join Claudia Medina, and thousands of Amnesty International activists around the world, in urging Mexico’s Federal Attorney General, Jesús Murillo Karam, to carry out a full, swift and independent investigation into her torture complaint.

I have seen Claudia Medina cry many times. 
She cried when she told me about the torture, including sexual abuse, she suffered at the hands of Mexican marines in 2012. She also cried when she explained what it is like to live with federal charges pending over her head, accused of being a member of a criminal gang, facing the risk of being arrested again at any time. Then once more when she told me about how her children were suffering. 
But today is the first time I have seen her cry out of joy and relief. A judge has just dropped the last remaining charge against her, arguing that the sole piece of evidence – a report filed by the marines – is a lie. 
The judge confirmed that after her arrest Claudia was tortured and sexually assaulted by marines in order to force her to incriminate herself and others in drug-related crimes. The offences took place on 7 August 2012 at a Navy barracks in Veracruz state, Eastern Mexico. 
“For two years I have lived with the accusations made against me which were based on the torture they inflicted on me. It has been very hard. At the beginning I used to see all this as a monster standing in front of me, something I thought I was not going to be able to overcome,” said Claudia. 
“This affected me personally because everybody turned their backs on me. I was also unable to be a mum for my children 100 per cent. I was affected financially. I was not able to give my children what they were used to having and what they needed.” 
On 6 February a judge informed her that the last remaining charge against her for illegal weapon possession had been dropped. 
“I feel a lot calmer now,” Claudia said just before a press conference hosted by Amnesty International in Mexico City. 
“I’m now going to be able to travel around with much more freedom. Before, I used to walk thinking that I was going to be detained and tortured like before. But not anymore. I will hold my head high and say ‘I’m innocent and I have always told the truth’.” 
But Claudia’s struggle for justice is far from over. 
“My torture complaint is now with the Federal Attorney General’s Office. There have not been any advances but I will persist with this.” 
The federal prosecutors say Claudia has to actively reconfirm that she would like to continue with the judicial investigation into her accusations of torture. This is outrageous. Torture is an extremely serious crime and authorities have the obligation to promptly investigate any complaints as soon as they are filed. 
This approach to justice shows how impunity is perpetuated. According to official figures, Mexico has only achieved seven torture convictions at the federal level since 1991; this despite the widely documented use of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies and the armed forces across the country. 
Last September, Amnesty International launched a report as part of its global Stop Torture Campaign looking at the substantial rise in the number of reported torture cases in the past decade and the incredibly few investigations carried out. 
Its findings are backed up by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other ill-treatment, who recently visited Mexico and defined the use of torture there as “widespread”. 
One of the reasons for the lack of justice is the failure of the Federal Attorney General’s Office to carry out forensic medical examinations of possible victims in a prompt, adequate and impartial manner, as mandated by the UN-backed Istanbul Protocol which sets out guidelines for investigating torture allegations. 
This was the case with Claudia. She was left with no choice but to reach out to independent forensic experts from a local NGO and from the National Human Rights Commission. Both their reports prove that Claudia’s allegations are consistent with her physical and psychological scars. 
It remains to be seen whether the General Attorney’s Office will ever accept these independent medical examinations or if those who tortured Claudia will be brought to justice. 
But despite all the challenges, Claudia has a positive outlook for the future. 
“After this long process I had to go through I felt the need to become a human rights activist, to show that I’m not a criminal, as authorities portrayed me. 
I will not allow even one more woman to be tortured in Mexico.”

“We don’t go to anyone, we don’t visit anyone because dealing with him is so difficult,” the woman told Amnesty International researchers. “People stay away because they are afraid he will hurt their children. This little room is our bedroom, it is our living room, it is our everything. Our financial situation doesn’t allow us to register him in such [specialist] schools… That is why we need to resettle in another country, to get help for our child.

To date, the burden of caring for overwhelming majority of refugees is falling on five countries: Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq. Long-term settlement of the refugees in these poor countries is not feasible and is already leading to political instability.

The UN has set a target of resettling more than 300,000 Syrian refugees – under 10 percent of the total Syrian refugee population, and called upon the world to step up and help. The response to date has been pitiful.

The #OpenToSyria campaign aims to change that, but there are many challenges. Traditionally, when the UN sets a target of resettling refugees in a humanitarian crisis, the US takes on around half.

,  
Toronto-based psychiatrist Dr. Donald Payne has treated survivors of torture for almost four decades, and has been Amnesty International Canada’s health network coordinator since 1982.  He helped to found the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT) and served as the Canadian representative, one of two North American representatives, on the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT).  Dr. Payne’s work has focused both on treating those who have experienced torture and on advocating for countries to stop torturing. We recently spoke with Dr. Payne about the role of medical professionals in both preventing and carrying out torture, and how this relates to the case of jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, 1000 lashes (flogging is a form of torture), and a hefty fine, in addition to a decade-long post-prison sentence ban on working in the media or traveling outside Saudi Arabia. 
,  
, 	Dr. Payne, can you tell us a bit about your experience working with survivors of torture? 
,  
For more than 35 years I have worked with individuals who have experienced torture. In that time, I have seen more than 1,500 people from over 90 countries.  Initially most refugees came from Chile, with later spread to other countries as Canada took in more refugees.   Over the years, Iran has produced a steady flow of torture survivors. Whenever there is an uprising that is repressed somewhere in the 
,  
 world, we usually see torture survivors from that country arriving in Canada.  I have not seen an individual who has been flogged.  Flogging is not one of the usual methods of torture in countries that produce refugees arriving in Canada.  
,  
How do torture survivors find their way to you? 
,  
In most cases, the lawyers of refugee claimants seek the assistance of the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT) for medical or psychological assessments to support the refugee’s claim for refugee status. Other individuals are referred by refugee settlement workers, other agencies or by personal contact. They are usually referred on to me through CCVT. 
,  
We expect medical professionals to heal us. How have you seen medical professionals be complicit in torture? 
,  
There are health professionals who chose to be actively and purposefully involved in torture, such as the psychologists involved in the CIA torture at Guantanamo and doctors who actively work for repressive regimes. There are others who would prefer to act ethically but are caught up in the system, where they are employees of a state that tortures. They have a dual allegiance. They are responsible to their state employer, but they are also responsible for upholding their professional ethics, which dictate that they should not participate in any way in torture. In such circumstances, ethical standards indicate that the professional ethical standards supersede loyalty to the employer. 
,  
However, what works well in theory, can run into great difficulty in practice. As Jim Welsh, Amnesty International’s former Health and Human Rights Coordinator, recently said, “it is difficult to act ethically in unethical places.” In many countries there are few private doctors, and the only choice is to work for the state.  Standing up to a state that tortures can lead to immediate self-destruction, with the loss of one’s job, and possibly one’s career, if not worse.  As one such physician told me, “I have a responsibility to act ethically, but I also have a responsibility to support my family.” We cannot ethically ask doctors to stand up to torturers and risk losing their jobs and possibly more unless there is a network of support available to them to do this, such as through the active involvement of professional associations and others. 
,  
Are there medical professionals who take a stand against torture? 
,  
Usually we would not hear about an individual doctor who stood up to torturers. If a doctor in Saudi Arabia said he wouldn’t authorize flogging for Raif Badawi, would we hear about it? Such a doctor would presumably immediately lose his job and could be accused of supporting opponents of the government, with almost no way of letting the outside world know what had happened to him.  Amnesty International usually calls for independent medical examinations in order to ensure that the doctors performing the examinations do not have dual loyalty and are much freer to provide honest and reliable reports. It is hopeful that a group of independent doctors performing an assessment in a hospital would be able to be helpful to Raif Badawi in providing reliable independent assessments in a situation of group support. 
,  
The British Medical Association has taken the lead in dealing with physician’s involvement in torture following the torture of one of its members, Dr. Sheila Cassidy, in Chile in 1975 for treating an opponent of Pinochet. In 1992, it published Medicine Betrayed: The Participation of Doctors in Human Rights Abuses outlining various ways that physicians and several medical associations were involved in opposing governments’ human rights abuses. In January 2015, it held a conference along with Amnesty International and the British torture treatment centre, Freedom from Torture, dealing with this issue, which was highlighted again by the case of Raif Badawi. 
,  
 
,  
Medical professionals need a strong active supportive network to be able to stand up and act ethically. The 1992 British Medical Association report strongly opposed physician involvement in torture but also recognized that “the individual physician surrounded by men with guns is in a very weak position to assert moral beliefs let alone putting them into practice” and did not recommend that they become “heroes.” 
,  
As a psychiatrist, what is your reaction to the flogging sentence of Raif Badawi? 
,  
No one should ever be subjected to flogging as it is a form of torture. Flogging causes serious physical damage to the skin, with high risk of infection, and may affect underlying muscles. The psychological impacts of flogging may cause the most stress in the long-term. Waiting every week in anticipation of the lashes causes extreme psychological distress as well as physiological changes, such as high blood pressure.  People subjected to torture can be strong and resilient at first, but the ongoing torture and related dehumanization can wear them down over time. Once the torture is over, torture survivors may continue to struggle with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with long-term symptoms including nightmares, anxiety, depression, and increased hyper arousal. 
,  
I hope that Raif Badawi is not in solidarity confinement. It’s very difficult when prisoners are left with only their own thoughts—that greatly encourages losing hope and becoming demoralized. When they are with other prisoners, the prisoners often comfort and support each other, in particular around the medical results of torture.

From the plane, the change of seasons is evident: what three months ago was a large expanse of arid, dusty yellow land, now is dark brown and punctuated by moist green patches. After a first visit in September, my colleague Khairun and I are back in Iraqi Kurdistan (officially known as Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI) to assess the human rights situation of Syrian refugees and displaced Iraqis alike. 
As a result of the advance of the Islamic State armed group (IS) and other violence across the country, more than 2 million Iraqis were displaced during 2014. Nearly half of them, some 950,000, are now in the KRI, a small, semi-autonomous area in northern Iraq with a population of 5.2 million. In other words, the region has seen an influx of people equivalent to almost a fifth of its population – it would be like Scotland suddenly receiving a million people from England and Wales. 
Most of them are Yezidis from the Sinjar region, in addition to Turkmen and Arabs from towns and villages around Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city. Before January 2014, the KRI had already opened its doors to about 230,000 refugees from Syria. 
The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) has made efforts to build camps for the hundreds of thousands of displaced. Baharka camp, just outside Erbil, hosts around 3,000 displaced Iraqis and Palestinian refugees from Iraq. Being very close to the capital, this is one of the most visible camps. Despite the frequent visits by foreign dignitaries, journalists and charities, however, conditions in the camp are far from ideal, especially when it rains. After dark, solar-powered lamps and mobile torches keep the market going. 
The governorate of Dohuk, a town of 280,000 inhabitants west of Erbil, is hosting around 430,000 displaced people, in addition to refugees from Syria. When we first visited the Dohuk area, in September 2014, those who were not hosted by local families sought shelter in any available spaces: the local schools, building sites, unfinished buildings, garages, parks and gardens. Three months later, there are nine official camps for IDPs in the Dohuk governorate, hosting around 125,000 people – catering to only a fraction of the displaced. 
Two of the official camps were built by AFAD, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Agency; three were built by the United Nations; and the remaining four were built by the KRG. As a result, their standards of accommodation, facilities and services vary greatly. In Bersive I camp, for example, an AFAD camp hosting around 10,000 people near Zakho, the tents are not fully insulated from the rain, there is no hot water and the number of toilets and showers does not meet minimum standards for humanitarian response.

With all their shortcomings, the official camps built so far can only accommodate a small proportion of those in need. The majority are still scattered in hundreds of informal settlements, including construction sites, community spaces and unofficial camps. Others are in private accommodation or hotel rooms. Many of the displaced in the Dohuk governorate live in precarious and dangerous places where they are exposed to the elements and have limited or no access to water and electricity. We visited large, unfinished buildings with no walls, windows, doors or bathrooms, but where hundreds of families now live in makeshift rooms with plastic partitions. 
In winter, this difficult situation is made worse by the cold and rainy weather: at night the temperature can go below freezing. In the places we visited, people do not have enough blankets and warm clothes; lack sufficient fuel for heating and cooking; and have inadequate water and sanitation facilities. In a construction site near Zakho, Dohuk governorate, we saw people lighting paper on fire to try to keep warm; the weather forecast for the night is 3°C. Many of the people we visited would not have survived without the help of generous landowners and neighbours. 
  
There are an estimated 186,000 school-aged children (six to 17 years old) displaced in the Dohuk governorate. The majority of them (around 89,000, or 55%) are not in the IDP camps. Even in the camps, there are significant gaps in the provision of basic education. Outside the camps, parents need their children to work in order to contribute to meeting the family’s basic necessities. As a result, very few of the children we met are going to school.	  
  
We visited families in their tents, where we were offered countless cups of aromatic Arabic coffee and sweet tea. As we are women, the women of the families immediately felt more relaxed with us. We carefully explained Amnesty International’s role and the purpose of our visit, as it is important for them to understand that we cannot provide them with food or clothes. We find people are happy to talk to us all the same, since in many cases, none of the humanitarian organizations who provide them with food or clothes has stopped to listen to their full story. 
Some of the cases we documented will need long-term follow-up. 
But more can and must be done now in response to the dire winter conditions. As soon as we returned from Iraqi Kurdistan we published part of our findings, urging the international community to improve coordination and fill the gaps in humanitarian assistance. 
For the hundreds of thousands of displaced in Iraqi Kurdistan, the struggle for survival is far from over. The least the world can do is to help to make their situation a little less bleak.

“The more things change, the more they stay the same,” wrote French critic Alphonse Karr in 1849. Turbulent change, he observed, has a counterproductive tendency to reinforce the status quo. 
,  
A truism which precisely reflects the state of human rights in Egypt today. 
,  
Four years after electrifying scenes beamed around the world from Tahrir Square – a vast ocean of people congregating and chanting defiantly for democratic reform – the aspirations of the Egyptian people and the ‘January 25 Revolution’ have yet to be realized. 
,  
And while the Egyptian popular uprising succeeded in deposing long-serving President Hosni Mubarak, successive administrations have failed to adequately address the endemic human rights violations which continue to plague the country. 
,  
The faces have changed, but the policies remain much the same. 
,  
One of the main protagonists from the outset of the revolution have been student protesters. This movement has seen its actions increasingly targeted by government legislation. Since 2013, Amnesty has documented hundreds of cases of arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment. Excessive use of force by state security forces is rife, with perpetrators enjoying near total impunity. Meanwhile, restrictions on freedom of expression and association are tightly imposed and institutional discrimination against women and minorities continue unabated. 
,  
In response, and in commemoration of the 4th Anniversary of the January 25 Revolution, Amnesty International Canada and the Egyptian Canadian Coalition for Democracy (ECCD) are asking Canadian students and universities to stand in solidarity with their Egyptian counterparts. 
,  
,  
In 2013, a controversial new protest law signed by interim-president Adly Mansour granted security forces greater discretion to use force to halt protests and disperse demonstrators. 
,  
The 2014 academic school year began amid heightened tension in light of additional measures imposed across universities permitting security to stop and search students on campus at will. 
,  
Students gathered across Egypt to voice their disapproval with the new measures. One such demonstration at Alexandria University quickly descended into violence with security forces firing tear gas canisters and shotgun pellets “randomly against students when it was not necessary,” even as some fled indoors. The melee resulted in at least 150 arrests and 35 injuries, some critical. 
,  
Amnesty International immediately criticized the law, calling it “a serious setback that poses a grave threat to freedom of assembly and gives security forces a free rein to use excessive force, including lethal force, against demonstrators.” 
,  
,  
In response to the heavy-handed crackdown on university demonstrators, Amnesty International Canada and the Egyptian Canadian Coalition for Democracy released a joint statement calling on Canadian students and universities to stand in solidarity with Egyptian university students, defending their right to safely assemble and express themselves freely on school campuses without fear of police intimidation. 
,  
Supported by a growing number of student groups from across Canada, it calls on the Canadian government, civil society and human rights groups to pressure Egyptian officials for the immediate and unconditional release of all peaceful protesters. 
,  
It also voices concern over the “violation of the basic human rights of Egyptian students,” citing the use of excessive force by security forces in their attempt to “stifle and crush” debate and dissent. 
,  
This joint action of solidarity follows the release of a report by Egyptian monitoring groups entitled “Violation of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities”, which states that this draconian protest law has resulted in the deaths of 176 students and the arrests of 1347 others by mid-march. Figures which have since climbed to more than two hundred deaths and two thousand arrests. 
,  
,  
Amnesty International has released several urgent actions in relation to the student protests in 2014. 
,  
In April, Amnesty International launched an urgent action on behalf of Mansoura University students Abrar Al-Anany and Menatalla Moustafa, and teacher Yousra Elkhateeb, urging Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the three women and grant Moustafa access to medical attention she may require. 
,  
In May, Al-Anany and Mustafa were sentenced to two years each for their involvement in a protest while Elkhateeb received a six year sentence. The Court of Cassation has since agreed to review the cases of the Mansoura women in April 2015. 
,  
In November, an urgent action was launched on behalf of Mahmoud Hussein, an 18 year-old student who has been held in police detention without trial for nearly a year. Hussein was detained by security forces at a checkpoint after leaving a protest and taken to a police station. 
,  
During interrogation, Mahmoud was subjected to torture with electric shocks and coerced into a confession. The following day he appeared before the prosecutor without his lawyer present and recanted his “confession.” The prosecutor failed to investigate the claims, and ordered him held. 
,  
Amnesty International calls on Egyptian authorities to “immediately and unconditionally release Mahmoud Hussein and drop any pending charges against him,” to protect him from “further torture and other ill-treatment” and for an “impartial investigation into reports of torture in custody.” 
,  
,  
Sadly, stories like Mahmoud Hussein’s are not uncommon. In fact, the year following President Morsi’s overthrow saw a deterioration in human rights conditions with a surge in arbitrary arrests, incidents of torture and extra-judicial killings by security forces. 
,  
Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui stated: “Despite repeated promises by current and former presidents to respect the rule of law, over the past year flagrant violations have continued at an astonishing rate, with security forces effectively granted a free rein to commit human rights violations with impunity.” 
,  
Amnesty International has documented numerous examples of torture and other ill-treatment perpetrated by security forces against students. 
,  
A particularly shocking case was that of 23-year-old student M.R.S. Arrested near Nasr City in Cairo, he reported being held in detention for 47 days where he was tortured and raped: 
,  
“The officer caught my testicle and started to squeeze it… I was screaming from the pain and bent my legs to protect my testicles then he inserted his fingers in my anus… he was wearing something plastic on his fingers… he repeated this five times,” he said. He also reported being “beaten on the penis with a stick” and “raped repeatedly by one or more security guards.” 
,  
And while he survived to recount his harrowing story, others were less fortunate. 
,  
Ahmed Ibrahim was among four people who have died in Mattereya police station since April 2014. In a phone call to his father he pleaded for help saying: “I am dying, father.” A post-mortem examination found bruises and cuts on his body suggesting he may have been tortured. 
,  
Monitoring group Wikithawra has recorded at least 80 deaths in custody over the past year. 
,  
,  
A recent United Nations ‘Universal Periodic Review’ of Egypt introduced eight recommendations aimed at addressing the human rights crisis engulfing the country including a stop to torture and other ill-treatment, and the revision or repeal of the contentious new Protest Law. 
,  
The measure was largely dismissed by the Egyptian delegation in Geneva in a “cynical” move Amnesty International says leaves “its human rights record lay[ing] in tatters.”

The streets are empty. The prisons are full. The fourth anniversary of Egypt’s “25 January Revolution” is passing largely in silence, with many of the young activists who led it now firmly behind bars. 
	For many women in Egypt, this Sunday will bring back particularly bitter memories – of a brief moment when it seemed that a better future was finally within reach. 
Women stood alongside men throughout the 2011 uprising. However, in the years since they have faced a rising tide of violence and discrimination. 
And nowhere is safe. 
Shocking testimonies uncovered by Amnesty International show women enduring violence at the hands of their partners, the public and the police. 
Women are not safe at home. One woman told Amnesty International of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband: 
“He used to tie me to the bed and beat me with a belt… Once, when I was pregnant, he beat me and pushed me down the stairs. I miscarried as a result.” 
Egypt’s divorce laws stop women from leaving without giving up their financial rights or fighting long and costly court battles. 
“As a woman, the process is inhuman,” one journalist who took her husband to court to get a divorce told us. 
Women are not safe in the streets. If it was the “25 January Revolution” that put Cairo’s Tahrir Square on the lips of the world, it has now become infamous for mob sexual attacks on women protesters. 
One woman survivor described such an attack in the Square on 25 January 2013: 
“I felt hands touch me from all directions, and I was moved, almost carried, inside the circle as people continued saying: ‘don’t worry’. They were saying that while violating me…” 
The few women who do approach the police or Public Prosecution for help have found dismissive or poorly trained officials, Amnesty International’s research has found. 
“The police do not care,” one survivor of domestic violence told us, “they don’t think it is a problem if a husband beats his wife.” 
And far from assisting women who have survived violence, security forces can be the cause of it. 
A young woman who served two years in prison for adultery told Amnesty International that a police officer had slapped her and watched while her husband beat her in the police station. 
“No decent woman would leave her husband and children, you fallen woman,” the officer told her. 
She was six months’ pregnant at the time. 
Women have also faced sexual and gender-based violence in prisons and police stations. Protesters detained by the security forces told Amnesty International that the arresting officers often groped and harassed them. 
One woman student told us a riot police officer had threatened to rape her after arresting her on campus in December 2013. 
“I’ll show you what it’s like to be treated like a woman,” he told her. 
It is Egypt’s women activists, not the authorities, that are taking action to check the wave of abuse. 
Women’s groups have stepped in to fill the vacuum left by official inaction, documenting abuses and providing life-changing support to survivors. Activists have launched public-awareness campaigns and pushed the government for better laws and policing. 
But the authorities have also pushed back, blocking vital funding to human rights groups and denying NGOs permission to open women’s shelters. 
The relentless crackdown has forced many groups to scale down their work. 
Promises by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to make women’s rights a top priority, following savage attacks on women in Tahrir Square around his inauguration, now ring hollow. 
So far the authorities have dodged the big reforms. Instead, they have delivered measures that are piecemeal and tokenistic. 
As the authorities dither, women suffer. The majority of violence against women still goes unreported, un-investigated and unpunished. There has been continued, partisan bickering over who is responsible for the abuses. 
It’s time to stop the blame game. 
There must be no ‘ifs’, no ‘buts’. What’s needed is a national strategy to address violence against women. The authorities should fix the laws that fail women survivors of violence and put women’s rights at the heart of the political agenda. 
President al-Sisi vowed in Davos that he would fix Egypt’s economy. For that to happen, his administration must first recognize that Egyptian women are part of the solution. 
Women need a safe environment – one where they can participate safely in the economic, social and political space free from discrimination and violence. 
But today any promise of real reform seem just as remote as ever. 
As one former woman prisoner told us: “If you have a problem, complain to God.”

,  
The death of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz has, once again, focused international attention to the oil-rich Middle Eastern country’s human rights record. 
,  
“What will be King Abdullah’s legacy?” everybody seems to be asking. 
,  
The answer is not simple.   
,  
Since taking the throne in 2005, King Abdullah initiated some positive reforms. 
,  
Women, for example, have slowly been included in the Shura Council, a powerless consultative body to advise the King, and incorporated into the workforce – with some being allowed to work in courts as lawyers. 
,  
The late King is credited for opening a dozen new universities and providing thousands of Saudi Arabian citizens with generous scholarships to study abroad. He also initiated seemingly ambitious judicial reforms that have not really gone anywhere.   
,  
He even decreed the founding of a formal National Human Rights Commission and allowed the establishment of a supposedly independent human rights organization. 
,  
But that’s where the good news ends. 
,  
Despite the advances in recent years, the country’s human rights record has worsened. The negatives vastly outweigh the positives. 
,  
Recently, the case of Raif Badawi has come to symbolize the worsening human rights situation in the country. 
,  
In May 2014, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for starting a website for social and political debate in Saudi Arabia, the ‘Free Saudi Liberal Network’ and charged with insulting Islam. 
,  
He received the first 50 lashes on Friday 9 January. While the flogging has been postponed, he is still languishing in jail and the punishment could be resumed at any time. 
,  
Raif Badawi’s case is just one example we have documented of the state’s brutality in Saudi Arabia.   
,  
Under King Abdullah’s reign, there has been an increasing crackdown on freedom of expression. All of the country’s prominent human rights activists have either been jailed, forced into silence, or fled the country. Hundreds have been imprisoned for “crimes” such as using social media to discuss human rights issues or for “insulting the King”. 
,  
Throughout his reign, hundreds of people have been beheaded and several hundreds sentenced to death. Severe discrimination against women continues in law and practice, including through an archaic driving ban and a deeply discriminating guardianship system which requires women to get the permission of a male relative to work, seek higher education and travel. Citizens and foreigners alike are banned from practicing their religions freely if they do not comply with the state’s version of Sunni Islam. Torture remains rife. 
,  
The list of violations doesn’t end there. 
,  
In February 2013, the country introduced a repressive counter-terrorism law that effectively legalizes repression.   
,  
Under the law, “terrorist acts” are so loosely defined that acts of peaceful expression could be punished under them. 
,  
The law also granted the Ministry of Interior wide powers to order searches, seizures, arrests and detentions of suspects with little or no judicial oversight. And it has been used to target women drivers, lawyers, human rights activists, and others who expressed their ideas peacefully. 
,  
Suspects can now be held for up to 90 days with no contact with the outside world beyond a single phone call to their family. They cannot see a lawyer. This makes detainees even more vulnerable to torture. 
,  
It’s not hard to see how this can be easily misused to punish peaceful activists. 
,  
Saudi Arabia has a very long way to go if it wants to be seen as a country that respects basic human rights. 
,

The death of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz has, once again, focused international attention to the oil-rich Middle Eastern country’s human rights record. 
“What will be King Abdullah’s legacy?” everybody seems to be asking. 
The answer is not simple.   
Since taking the throne in 2005, King Abdullah initiated some positive reforms. 
Women, for example, have slowly been included in the Shura Council, a powerless consultative body to advise the King, and incorporated into the workforce – with some being allowed to work in courts as lawyers. 
The late King is credited for opening a dozen new universities and providing thousands of Saudi Arabian citizens with generous scholarships to study abroad. He also initiated seemingly ambitious judicial reforms that have not really gone anywhere.   
He even decreed the founding of a formal National Human Rights Commission and allowed the establishment of a supposedly independent human rights organization. 
But that’s where the good news ends. 
Despite the advances in recent years, the country’s human rights record has worsened. The negatives vastly outweigh the positives. 
Recently, the case of Raif Badawi has come to symbolize the worsening human rights situation in the country. 
In May 2014, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for starting a website for social and political debate in Saudi Arabia, the ‘Free Saudi Liberal Network’ and charged with insulting Islam. 
He received the first 50 lashes on Friday 9 January. While the flogging has been postponed, he is still languishing in jail and the punishment could be resumed at any time. 
Raif Badawi’s case is just one example we have documented of the state’s brutality in Saudi Arabia.   
Under King Abdullah’s reign, there has been an increasing crackdown on freedom of expression. All of the country’s prominent human rights activists have either been jailed, forced into silence, or fled the country. Hundreds have been imprisoned for “crimes” such as using social media to discuss human rights issues or for “insulting the King”. 
Throughout his reign, hundreds of people have been beheaded and several hundreds sentenced to death. Severe discrimination against women continues in law and practice, including through an archaic driving ban and a deeply discriminating guardianship system which requires women to get the permission of a male relative to work, seek higher education and travel. Citizens and foreigners alike are banned from practicing their religions freely if they do not comply with the state’s version of Sunni Islam. Torture remains rife. 
The list of violations doesn’t end there. 
In February 2013, the country introduced a repressive counter-terrorism law that effectively legalizes repression.   
Under the law, “terrorist acts” are so loosely defined that acts of peaceful expression could be punished under them. 
The law also granted the Ministry of Interior wide powers to order searches, seizures, arrests and detentions of suspects with little or no judicial oversight. And it has been used to target women drivers, lawyers, human rights activists, and others who expressed their ideas peacefully. 
Suspects can now be held for up to 90 days with no contact with the outside world beyond a single phone call to their family. They cannot see a lawyer. This makes detainees even more vulnerable to torture. 
It’s not hard to see how this can be easily misused to punish peaceful activists. 
Saudi Arabia has a very long way to go if it wants to be seen as a country that respects basic human rights. 
What is clear, however, is that there are many actions that King Abdullah’s successor King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud could and should take to undo some of these wrongs. 
Releasing everyone imprisoned solely for voicing their opinions peacefully, extensively revising its anti-terror law, ending discrimination against women and minorities, and ending executions, torture and cruel punishments, such as flogging would be some good first steps.

Canada has, commendably, offered refuge to Mr. Badawi’s family. Since last fall, his wife and three young children have been living in Sherbrooke. But Mr. Badawi himself remains behind bars in Jeddah, serving a 10-year prison sentence for insulting Islam. He has also been fined the equivalent of $315,000 and placed under a 10-year travel ban. He is prohibited from appearing in the media for life. And he is to be flogged 1,000 times – 50 lashes each week, doled out in public over 20 weeks, after Friday prayers. 
,  
Mr. Badawi has already received the first 50 lashes. Last week’s second batch was postponed – but only because he had not yet sufficiently healed from the first round to endure a second flogging. 
,  
His crime? Believing in freedom of expression, women’s equality and the right to differ and disagree publicly. He was charged with insulting Islam because he criticized religious leaders for disregarding human rights. 
,  
Mr. Badawi’s case captured public attention in the same week that the Paris terrorist attacks brought the relationship between freedom of expression and religion to the fore. Governments everywhere, including Saudi Arabia’s, forcefully condemned that violence. Yet most have gone no further than to express concern about Mr. Badawi’s case, while steaming ahead, business as usual, in their dealings with Saudi Arabia. 
,  
Speaking out after – not before – the first 50 lashes, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said Canada “is deeply concerned by the public flogging of Raif Badawi.” Mr. Baird urged clemency. A good first step, certainly, but Mr. Badawi’s family in Sherbrooke would prefer a clear demand from the country that is now their home that their husband and father be spared further rounds of this brutal punishment, and unconditionally released from prison. 
,  
For Canada, business as usual with Saudi Arabia includes a lucrative $15-billion arms deal reached last year with General Dynamics Land Systems of London, Ont. Under this deal, General Dynamics will sell many hundreds of armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia over the next decade or more. Canadian armoured vehicles will be at the disposal of a military that regularly uses such weapons to control and disperse crowds or has let them roll into neighbouring Bahrain to help crush a popular protest. 
,  
There’s the rub. To what extent is Canada’s reluctance to push for Mr. Badawi’s freedom due to arms deals like this one, and the tantalizing prospect of more to come? 
,  
It would certainly be in keeping with the world’s long-established silence about women’s inequality, torture, executions, repression of dissent, unfair trials, religious intolerance and other widespread abuses in Saudi Arabia. 
,  
Be it oil wealth, arms sales, alliances in the global “war on terror” or reliance on the foreign remittances of the millions of migrant workers who are the backbone of the Saudi economy, there are a multitude of interests that governments put above human rights in their relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
,  
That can’t continue. The irony of Mr. Badawi’s case and the General Dynamics deal making headlines this past week makes that abundantly clear. The overlap of these issues indicates two key steps that Canada must take to stand firm for human rights in Saudi Arabia. 
,  
First, Canada must lead a forceful international effort to press Saudi officials to relent in Mr. Badawi’s case. Any one country acting on its own is unlikely to make a difference. But drawing governments together from various world regions might. As the country that has given refuge to Mr. Badawi’s family, Canada is well-placed to champion that effort. 
,  
Second, Canada must show that it is prepared to strictly enforce human-rights rules in arms sales decisions – no matter the country and no matter the amount of money involved. That is what Canadian controls require. Any deal that puts Canadian weapons in the hands of a government likely to use them to commit human-rights violations should not go ahead. 
,  
This invites the question: How was the Saudi deal reviewed, and on what grounds did our government demonstrate, as required by its own policy, “that there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against the civilian population”? 
,  
The government of Canada should release its assessment and show Canadians that it takes human rights seriously, especially when approving arms deals.

There are many reasons to lament Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s decision to cancel next month’s scheduled Three Amigos Summit with U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

On Sept. 26, 2014, Mexican police and gunmen opened fire on a busload of students from a teacher-training college in the rural community of Ayotzinapa. Six people were killed and dozens of students were taken away. Investigators were slow to react, wasting precious time during which the students might have been rescued. Forty-two students remain “disappeared.” Their families and classmates now fear for their own lives, as they seek the truth about what happened and who took part. 
, 	Sadly, this is no isolated case. According to official figures, more than 22,000 people have disappeared or gone missing since December 2006. Almost half of them disappeared between 2012 and 2014, under the current government of President Peña Nieto. 
,  
Disappearances are only one indication of Mexico’s grave human rights crisis. 
,  
Torture is quite simply out of control. Official sources confirm there have been more than 7,000 reports of torture and ill-treatment by police or members of the armed forces in Mexico in the last four years. A staggering 64 per cent of Mexican citizens are afraid they would be tortured if detained by the authorities, according to a survey commissioned by Amnesty International. 
,  
Mexico has legislation that makes torture a crime. Yet the use of torture has increased 600 per cent over the past decade, since the deployment of the army and marines in the so-called war on drugs. 
,  
Those responsible for torture and enforced disappearances are rarely brought to justice. Add that to shocking levels of corruption and collusion between authorities and organized crime, and the end result is a state of lawlessness, mounting violence and widespread distrust in public institutions. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children across Mexico are caught up in a brutal war between powerful drug cartels and corrupt security forces; and they have no faith that authorities will protect them. 
,  
It is these realities that have driven tens of thousands of Mexican citizens from all walks of life to take part in unprecedented peaceful protests throughout the country in recent months. Human rights organizations have documented disturbing incidents of police brutality against the protestors and the use of trumped up charges to detain them. Human rights defenders, including lawyers representing the families of the disappeared students, have been under surveillance. 
,  
“New” measures announced by President Peña Nieto in November only offer more of the same strategies that have already failed catastrophically. They do not address the entrenched failure to bring criminals and human rights violators to justice. That failure is the main ingredient in the lethal cocktail that is driving Mexico into a state of lawlessness; as is uncontrolled violence and entrenched corruption. 
,  
The root cause of Mexico’s national security crisis does not lie at the bottom of the police chain. For many years now, corrupt practices have originated at the highest levels of government and dripped down the chain, rotting the entire system. 
, 	The only way for Mexico to move away from its dark present is for authorities to put in place structural changes which bring human rights to the centre of the political agenda. Mexican authorities have the power to make these changes but they need the political will to do so. 
,  
Pressure from influential partners can help create that will. 
,  
Mexico is Canada’s NAFTA partner. We are tied together by trade, investment, security co-operation and the well over one million Canadian tourists who make their way to Mexico each year. For these reasons and others, Mexico is very mindful of what Canada has to say. 
,  
February’s Three Amigos Summit would have been a valuable opportunity for Harper to raise these human rights concerns directly and press for solutions. The delay of the summit cannot mean a delay of that urgently needed high-level action. Mexico’s human rights crisis needs and deserves Canada’s attention, and needs it now.

One of her chief advocates is Morena Herrera. Here, the ex-freedom fighter, staunch feminist and sexual and reproductive rights campaigner tells us why El Salvador’s abortion ban needs to go. 
,  
“I was a guerrilla fighter. I was an activist for social change since I was young,” says Morena Herrera. When the civil war ended in 1992 and the Peace Accords were signed, she knew that the fight was far from over. 
,  
“Those accords left big holes when it came to women’s rights,” she says. “I realized I had to fight another way. Women’s rights are human rights and they have to be a priority.” 
,  
Since 2009, Morena has been fighting “another way” through the Citizen’s Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, a collective she heads today. 
,  
Infamous among the women the group has defended are Beatriz, who nearly died because she was refused a termination of an unviable pregnancy that was threatening her life, and the group of 17 women, including Guadalupe mentioned above, who are currently appealing against convictions for pregnancy-related “offences”. 
,  
These women have all had their lives devastated by El Salvador’s brutal ban on abortion. 
,  
,  
It wasn’t always like this. Before 1997, abortion was permitted in three exceptional cases: if a woman’s life was at risk, in cases of rape, and in cases of foetal abnormality. 
,  
“In those days,” says Morena, “you could have an abortion on the hush and you wouldn’t be prosecuted or persecuted. Some women would resort to acids and hooks to abort, because abortion was still illegal outside those exceptions. But when things went wrong, they could go to the hospital and receive treatment without the fear of arrest.” 
,  
But, after 1997, El Salvador’s penal code was amended and abortion was banned completely, and a culture of incriminating women increased. 
,  
“Today, women who go to hospital with bleeding after a miscarriage are immediately accused,” says Morena. “Even without investigation of the facts, they are accused and indicted. In some cases, the offence of abortion is changed to aggravated homicide. And then the sentences are draconian, ranging from 30 to 50 years in jail.” 
,  
,  
Against this backdrop, Morena admits that the work she does with the Citizen’s Group is hard. 
,  
“One day I had a phone call. A student had been bleeding in the bathroom at school,” she recalls. “I told a colleague to take her to a private hospital. She had been raped outside the university [and became pregnant], but didn’t tell anyone. She got pills made from caustic soda. The pills destroyed the walls of her arteries – but she was still pregnant. For us, the dilemma is, do we prefer to see this person dead or in jail? This is our everyday reality. It’s harrowing.” 
,  
Unwanted pregnancy is a harrowing reality for all too many young women and girls in El Salvador. As Morena points out, 36% of hospital births in the country are to girls aged 9 to 18 years. With no proper sex education, limited access to contraception and a total ban on abortion, youngsters are left with no way out – apart from clandestine abortions (“35,000 a year”) or suicide (accounting for 57% of teen deaths in pregnancy). 
,  
“I’m the mother of four daughters, three of whom are from different fathers,” she says. “I personally know the distress felt when you have an unwanted pregnancy. I only made a conscious choice with my fourth child. All children should come into the world this way.” 
,  
,  
Morena and her colleagues not only face legal challenges, but social ones as well. 
,  
“People say we are committing a crime by raising awareness, supporting women and advocating on their behalf and we respond by saying we are fighting to change an unfair law. That can’t be illegal. We don’t accept that,” she says. 
,  
“We have received threats and there have been stories in the press and on TV that have been very stigmatising.” 
,  
This is where Amnesty International can play a positive role. “When Amnesty came to El Salvador and launched its report it gave us some peace of mind. We’re not crazy! We have support. The most important thing is that Amnesty reaches other governments and asks them to put pressure on El Salvador. Our voices are sometimes not heard, so that would help us a lot.” 
,  
,  
Amid the many setbacks, there are always successes. Morena remembers the first woman the Citizen’s Group helped free. 
,  
“She was a mother of three who had been sentenced to 30 years in jail,” recalls Morena. “We found out about the case from an article in the New York Times and started to investigate. I have the same surname as her so I could get into the prison as family. She told me what had happened. We examined the case files and with the help of forensic doctors from Argentina, Guatemala and Spain we were able to show there had been a mistake in her trial, a judicial error. We spent four years campaigning for her release.” 
,  
When they finally freed her, Morena was ecstatic. “I spent three days smiling,” she says. “It was very satisfying. And after a while she too started to defend the rights of other women.” 
,

,  
This week, people across the Philippines are incredibly excited about the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis. 
,  
Not only is this the first papal visit to our country in two decades, but Pope Francis has already inspired millions of people across the globe – Catholics and non-Catholics alike – with his message of hope, mercy and compassion for the world’s poorest people. 
,  
One of the issues that Pope Francis has spoken out about strongly and clearly continues to blight the Philippines – torture. Last year he condemned torture as a “very grave sin”. 
,  
His Holiness has repeatedly urged governments around the world to stamp out this abhorrent practice and “invite[s] Christians to commit themselves to work together for its abolition and to support victims and their families.” 
,  
Perhaps it is divine providence that torture will actually be on the table of the Philippine Senate the same week as the Papal visit. 
,  
On 14 January, an inquiry on police torture will be held jointly by the Senate Committees on Justice and Human Rights and on Public Order. The hearing comes as a direct result of a report which the human rights organization Amnesty International – on whose Philippines board I serve as Chair – released in December. 
,  
As early as the 1970s, Amnesty International has campaigned internationally on behalf of Filipinos who are being subjected to human rights violations. During the Martial Law period in the Philippines, Amnesty International campaigned for the release of then Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. as a Prisoner of Conscience. He was detained incommunicado for long periods of time – a practice that can amount to torture. 
,  
Our recent report documented pervasive and rife torture in the Philippines, in particular in police detention, and the culture of impunity that allows perpetrators to get away with it. 
,  
Despite the Philippines’ ratification of two key international anti-torture treaties, torture methods such as electrocution, mock executions, waterboarding, asphyxiating with plastic bags, beatings and rape continue to be employed by officers who torture for extortion and to extract forced confessions. 
,  
Those responsible are almost never held to account, allowing this vicious cycle of abuse to continue unchecked. In 2009, the Philippines passed a progressive Anti-Torture Act, but it has been poorly implemented – it is telling that, more than five years since it was enacted, there has not been a single conviction under the law. 
,  
The simple fact is that no one who is taken in to police detention is safe from torture, though those most at risk include police informants who “want out”, repeat offenders and political activists. The majority of these people come from poor backgrounds. 
,  
The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines has declared 2015 the “Year of the Poor”, partly in honour of the visit of Pope Francis, a known champion for the poor – it is important to remember that poverty does not just mean a lack of money, but it is often society’s underprivileged who are most at risk of human rights violations, such as torture. 
,  
This week’s Senate inquiry was announced on the very day Amnesty International’s report was launched. It is to the Philippine Senate’s credit that they have shown a willingness to tackle the issue and taken Amnesty International’s report seriously. 
,  
The Senate hearing, if it is followed up with genuine action, could be the first step to ending torture in our country once and for all. What the Philippines needs is to back up its legal commitments with decisive action. The government’s next step should be putting in place two truly independent systems, one for monitoring places of detention and one unified and effective institution to investigate and prosecute police abuse. 
,  
Crucially, those responsible for torture must be held to account – the government needs to send a clear message that no one is above the law. 
,  
The case of Darius Evangelista is as shocking as it is telling. Darius, a porter, was picked up by police in 2010, and his severed head was later found floating in Manila Bay. The case drew both national and international attention when a video surfaced of him being tortured by police. But despite uniformed police officers being clearly visible in this video, no one has been convicted in the case, and three of the seven officers implicated in his torture are still at large. 
,  
For too long, cases like Darius’ have been the norm in the Philippines. In many ways, he embodies the kind of people Pope Francis himself shows mercy and compassion to: the poor, the vulnerable, victims of human rights violations. One of the best ways for the Philippine government to honour the Pope’s visit to our country is to genuinely make the effort to give justice to victims of torture and to stamp out this horrific practice once and for all.

Thirteen months of detentions at Guantánamo was already far too long. By then, February 2003, the Secretary of Defense had authorized interrogation techniques that violated the international ban on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
,  
Thirteen years is a human rights outrage. Detainees held for year after year without charge or trial. Torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, excessive force, force feeding, a handful of prosecutions under a  military commission system that does not meet international fair trial standards. 
,  
There were 245 detainees still held at the base at the end of President President Barack Obama committed his administration to closing the Guantánamo detention facility “promptly” and at the latest by 22 January 2010. 
,  
Today there are 127 men still held at Guantánamo, the majority without charge or trial. Almost half of them have been approved for transfer out of the base, most since January 2010 or earlier.The most immediate reason that resolution of these detentions seems as remote as ever is that the issue became mired in a domestic political impasse in which Congress has acted against closure and the administration has been unwilling or unable to find a way around this. Under international law, however, domestic law and politics may not be invoked to justify failure to comply with treaty obligations. It is an inadequate response for one branch of government to blame another for a country’s human rights failure. International law demands that solutions be found, not excuses. 
,  
At the root of this injustice is the failure of the US government – all three branches of it – to address the detentions as a human rights issue. As we approach 11 January 2015, day 4,749 in the life of this notorious prison camp, the USA is still failing to address the detentions within a human rights framework. 
,  
In the past year alone, three UN human rights treaty monitoring bodies have called for resolution of the detentions. 
,  
In April, having reviewed the USA’s record under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the USA in 1992, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the USA to “end the use of administrative detention without charge or trial” at Guantánamo. It called on the USA to conduct any prosecutions of Guantánamo detainees in the ordinary criminal justice system, not under a military commission system that fails to comply with international fair trial standards. 
,  
In August, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the USA to “end the system of administrative detention without charge or trial and ensure the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility without further delay”. Pointing to the prohibition of discrimination, it also called on the USA to “guarantee the right of detainees to a fair trial, in compliance with international human rights standards” and for any detainee who is not charged and tried to be “released immediately”. 
,  
And in November, the UN Committee against Torture reiterated to the USA what it had told it eight years earlier in 2006 in relation to the Guantánamo detentions, namely that “indefinite detention constitutes per se a violation” of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty ratified by the USA in 1994. The Committee expressed its concern about the “cumulative effect that the conditions of detention and treatment in Guantánamo have had on the psychological health of detainees” and repeated its call on the USA to “cease the use of indefinite detention without charge or trial”. 
,  
Violations of international human rights law will forever be associated with the Guantánamo detentions. Detainees were subjected to torture or other ill-treatment either at the prison or before they arrived there. Prolonged incommunicado detention as well as enforced disappearances took place at Guantánamo as well as elsewhere in the US detention system. For years, hundreds of Guantánamo detainees were denied their right to have a judge rule on the lawfulness of their detention. The few that faced criminal charges during the Bush years were not brought before any ordinary US court of law; instead, for such prosecutions the government invented an ad hoc system of military commissions, applying rules that fell far short of international fair trial standards. 
,  
The Obama administration is continuing with military commissions – it has transferred only one detainee to the ordinary criminal justice system for trial in US federal court, and that was five years ago. The administration is currently intending to seek death sentences against six detainees if it obtains their convictions in their forthcoming military commission trials. The imposition of the death penalty after unfair trials violates the right to life under international law. 
,  
To be sure, there has been a recent flurry of detainee transfers out of Guantánamo. Twenty-eight detainees were transferred out of the base during 2014, following the 11 who had been transferred from there in 2013. Recent transfers have included two men to Slovakia, three to Georgia, five to Kazakhstan and six to Uruguay, the latest countries to step in and help the USA out of the hole it has dug for itself. The USA continues to seek to have other countries do what it, the creator of the Guantánamo prison camp, refuses to do: namely, to accept detainees that the USA decides no longer to detain but who cannot be immediately repatriated for whatever reason. 
,  
The USA also remains on the wrong side of its international obligations through its failure to ensure full accountability for the violations committed at the base and elsewhere. To reiterate: the Guantánamo detention facility has been the location for multiple human rights violations over the years, including enforced disappearance. 
,  
Last month the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence confirmed that Guantánamo had been used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for secret detentions in 2003 and 2004. 
,  
At least 28 of those still held at Guantánamo were held in the CIA’s secret detention programme prior to being transferred to the naval base, subjected to enforced disappearance for between 40 days and four and a half years in CIA custody. A number of them were subjected to torture under interrogation while in that unlawful programme. 
,  
Torture and enforced disappearances are crimes under international law. The USA remains in serious violation of its human rights obligations by failing to ensure full truth, remedy and accountability for these crimes. 
,  
As well as ending the Guantánamo detentions in a manner that is fully consistent with international human rights law, and closing the detention facility, the USA must ensure thorough and impartial investigations into all allegations of human rights violations, bring those responsible to justice and ensure genuine access to remedy to those who suffered the violations.

No doubt about it, 2014 has been a tough year for human rights. As we look ahead into 2015, with a federal election sometime in the next 10 months, it is time to turn things around. That means addressing serious concerns in Canada and championing improvements around the world. 
,  
Every year has its share of human rights heartbreak, but 2014 was particularly heavy. The wrenching catastrophe that has displaced half of all Syrians worsened. Tragedies in the Central African Republic and South Sudan claimed more victims. Another cycle of rocket attacks and reprisals in Israel and Gaza was marked by an exceptionally fierce Israeli military assault on Gaza. Unexpected and devastating conflicts erupted in Ukraine and northern Iraq. 
,  
On the home front, the long-standing crisis of violence against indigenous women and girls came to the fore this year with two Winnipeg riverside tragedies involving Cree teenage girls. Tina Fontaine’s body was pulled out of the Red River in August. Rinelle Harper was found on the banks of the Assiniboine in November. Tina Fontaine was murdered. Rinelle Harper was brutally attacked but survived. Both highlight that a disgraceful human rights failing is not getting better. 
,  
Concern about Canada’s approach to refugee protection deepened. The Federal Court intervened and overturned punitive refugee health-care cuts. And Canadians were troubled by their government’s failure to make a generous pledge to resettle Syrian refugees. 
,  
Canada does continue to make important contributions to addressing serious global human rights problems, such as maternal and child health; child, early and forced marriage; and entrenched violations in countries like Iran, Sri Lanka and Syria. 
, 	But that is undermined by shortcomings at home, particularly in upholding the rights of indigenous peoples. It is set back by polarizing positions on the world stage, such as the refusal to even mildly chide the Israeli government for its transgressions. And it is eroded by a failure to engage fully with the international human rights system, evidenced by failure to sign on to important treaties dealing with torture prevention and the arms trade. 
,  
Human rights rarely emerge as a priority issue in any election. But human rights are central to the issues likely to dominate next year’s campaign. 
,  
Economic growth will not be sustainable without strong respect for indigenous peoples’ land rights, greater corporate accountability for upholding human rights and a trade policy grounded in human rights. 
,  
Law and orderwill be incomplete without addressing complicity in torture, allowing human rights lawsuits to go ahead against foreign governments, and adopting the long-delayed Bill C-279 to protect transgender people. 
,  
Too many families and communities will be left behind unless a public inquiry and national action plan for violence against indigenous women go ahead, unforgivable inequalities with respect to safe water, health care, education and housing on First Nations reserves are resolved, and the human rights dimensions of poverty are taken up by courts. 
,  
Security reforms will not be meaningful without meaningful human rights oversight of Canada’s national security agencies. And to ensure our borders are not shameful barriers to safety, it is time to turn back recent mean-spirited refugee reforms and respond generously to Syrian refugees. 
,  
Canada’s signature foreign policy initiatives dealing with women and girls are commendable but are hampered by refusal to fully take up sexual and reproductive rights. Across a range of measures, Canada’s standing as a leader with respect to women’s equality has slipped. We need a leaders’ debate in the 2015 election focused on issues identified by Canadian women and girls. The last one was in 1984. 
,  
And what of freedom and democracy? Strong criticism about some countries is undercut by silence with respect to others. That is matched by inconsistency in taking up cases of Canadians who experience human rights violations in other countries. It is not helped by taking potshots at UN human rights experts. And fine words about freedom on the world stage are increasingly called into question by wide-ranging measures targeted at punishing and curtailing advocacy and dissent within Canada. 
,  
Often we hope that human rights will make it onto election agendas. In 2015 it is time to recognize that human rights are the agenda. Failure to take necessary action sets back rights and justice. Embracing human rights lays the ground for meaningful, sustainable and inclusive progress, no matter the issue.

0,7 things you probably didn’t know about migrants on International Migrants Day,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-7-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-migrants-international-migrants-day/,"Is a migrant the same as an immigrant?

Find out today, on International Migrants Day. 
1. What’s the difference between an immigrant and a migrant?	All immigrants are migrants, but not all migrants are immigrants. And just to confuse things, there are also “emigrants”. Here’s how it works: A migrant moves around within their own country, or from one country to another, often to find work or join family members, because of poverty or a crisis. If you’re from Italy and go to live in Spain, then you would be an emigrant in Italy and an immigrant in Spain. You can be called an “international migrant” if you have foreign nationality or were born in another country. “Immigrant” and migrant are often used interchangeably and tend to get mixed up with the word “asylum-seeker” (see below). 
2. How many migrants are there in the world?	232 million people lived outside the country they were born in 2013, and 700 million migrated within their own countries. The world’s top migrant routes are: Mexico to the USA (12.2 million so far) from Ukraine to the Russian Federation (3.7 million) and people going in the opposite direction (3.5 million); and from Germany to the USA (1.3 million). 36% of the world’s migrants move between countries in the global south, and 35% from southern to northern countries. Migrants from northern countries are the world’s happiest, according to a recent worldwide poll. 
3. And how many are there where I live?	Most international migrants live in Europe (72 million) followed by Asia (71 million) and North America (53 million) Chances are you will overestimate the number living in your own country: A poll in 14 countries found that many people think immigrants make up a much bigger part of the population than they actually do. In Italy, for example, respondents estimated that 30 out of every 100 people were immigrants. The real number? Seven. 
4. Are migrants good or bad for the world economy?	The World Bank says international migration is good because workers can move to places where they are more productive. And the money migrants send home to developing countries (so-called “remittances”) is worth three times more what governments spend on development aid – an estimated US$404 billion in 2013. If you include the money migrants send home to people in to high-income countries, the number jumps to US$542 billion. 
5. How is a migrant different from a refugee or an asylum-seeker?	A refugee has been given permission to live in another country because their own government can’t or won’t protect them from human rights abuses. An asylum-seeker has applied to stay in another country for the same reasons, but hasn’t yet been recognised as a refugee. 
6. What does Amnesty have to say about migrants?	Migrants are often scapegoated by politicians or the media as “illegal immigrants”, “gate-crashers” – even “invaders” – who exploit host countries’ generosity. This creates the impression that migrants have no rights at all, and leads to racism and discrimination. We want to dispel these myths by focusing on the positive things migrants bring with them, including skills, resources and diversity. We also work to protect the most vulnerable migrants from being exploited and abused by their employers, traffickers and smugglers. Find out more. 
7. Name some famous migrants?	There are literally millions, so here’s just a few: UK-based Premier League footballer Didier Drogba (from Cote d’Ivoire), US actress Mila Kunis (Ukraine), France’s first ever female Education minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem (Morocco).

– Year end message to Amnesty International supporters from Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada 
There were so many reminders during 2014 of how deeply important solidarity is in our human rights work.  The solidarity Amnesty offers is made possible only through your support.  That solidarity makes a tremendous difference in defending human rights, everywhere.  It bolsters, protects and inspires.  It is the very essence of universal human rights. 
	It is about standing alongside individuals and communities; and doing so over the long term.  It means bearing witness when the world looks away; and joining our voices to frontline demands for justice.  Supporting women, men and young people everywhere in the struggle for human rights is at the very heart of Amnesty International.  
Around the world and here in Canada, so many times this year I saw and heard just how valuable that is.	  
 
As part of our global campaign to Stop Torture, I joined an Amnesty delegation in a visit to prisoner of conscience and torture survivor Ángel Colón in a maximum security prison in the mountains of the Mexican state of Nayarit.  Ángel was a migrant from the Afro-Caribbean Garífuna community in Honduras, where he was a human rights and environmental activist.  When his young son was diagnosed with cancer he set off to reach the United States and earn money to afford better treatments.  But when he was arrested at a safe house in Tijuana while waiting to cross the border, racism took hold.  Mexican authorities refused to believe that a black man could be anything other than a criminal.  First the police and then the military tortured him relentlessly until he broke and “confessed” to being part of a criminal gang.  
	For five years he was not charged or brought to trial. He was not given access to a lawyer, his family or consular visits.  Authorities paid no attention to his protests about having been tortured.  Finally he got word out through the family of another prisoner, asking them to contact Amnesty International.  That led to referral to a human rights lawyer and then Amnesty’s decision earlier this year to take up his case and campaign for his release.  
	Sadly, his son died from the cancer that Ángel had been hoping could be beaten. Having been through so much injustice and sadness, I was ready to meet an embittered man behind those prison walls.  But instead we met a man full of hope and grace.  A man who was moved to tears to learn of the thousands of people who had been campaigning for his release.  A man whose parting words to us were, ‘do not let down your guard’.  It was a powerful reminder that the struggle for human rights requires tenacity and perseverance. 
Amnesty activists in Canada and around the world took his words to heart.   They most certainly did not let down their guard.  There were more letters, more petitions, more Facebook messages and tweets, more media interviews and more embassy visits.  And less than six weeks after our visit, Ángel Colón was indeed once again a free man! 
His words will inspire our activism for a long time.  Do not let down your guard. 	  
We saw such incredible solidarity this year when women and girls were targeted and punished in Nigeria and Sudan.  Amnesty researchers worked hard to uncover as much background as possible when 273 schoolgirls were abducted by Nigeria’s notorious Boko Haram in April.  Amnesty supporters everywhere quickly joined the resounding global call to #BringBackOurGirls, a call that must continue to be heard loudly in 2015.	  
Amnesty responded quickly when Meriam Ibrahim was sentenced to death in Sudan in May, accused of adultery after she married a Christian man.  Shackled in prison, she gave birth to a daughter shortly after her death sentence had been imposed.  Solidarity with Meriam and her family was monumental, much of it led by Amnesty International.  The Sudanese government had no choice but to relent.  Meriam was freed and was able to leave Sudan in July.	  
This year we released an important report on human rights and mining in Guatemala, where communities have struggled for their rights to be protected amidst an influx of mining companies.  Individuals who speak out about mining have been vilified, attacked and killed.  Yolanda Oquelí, a courageous mining activist, was almost killed for taking a stand for rights.  
	When we shared the news that over 100,000 people worldwide spoke out for her safety, she said that made her feel she was part of a ‘family in all parts of the world’ which gave her a ‘force she could not describe.’ Our solidarity with Yolanda and communities across Guatemala in the campaign to ensure the country’s mining laws respect human rights is so crucial, particularly given that the majority of foreign mining interests in the country are Canadian.	  
In a South Sudanese displaced persons camp this summer I met with a camp elder, Simon Luk.  He and his family suffered a great deal in the horrifying wave of violence that devastated South Sudan this year.  He also shared with me the deeper tragedy of sacrifice and loss that his family has endured over several decades of war, liberation, war, independence and, once again, war.  But he wanted me to know what a constant Amnesty International had been throughout.  As he put it: ‘I know Amnesty International very well.  When everyone else has forgotten; Amnesty International is always there.  You have always been there for us. And now here you are today.’	  
We have responded quickly and forcefully when human rights defenders we have worked with in Colombia have come under attack.  Amnesty supporters across the country responded immediately when we learned that Indigenous leader Flaminio Onogama Gutiérrez, who has spoken at Amnesty events in Canada, had received death threats.  As a result of that pressure the Colombian government agreed to provide him with a bodyguard and other protection. 
We mobilized quickly as well when Juan Pablo Gutiérrez, a photographer and activist who works closely with endangered Indigenous communities in Colombia, was threatened with death.   His evocative photos have brought Amnesty’s campaign to protect Colombia’s Indigenous peoples to life.  Now he was the one at risk.  Thousands of Canadian spoke out and the Colombian government responded, assigning the country’s National Protection Unit to keep him safe. 
  
And we demonstrated solidarity with people throughout West Africa during the unprecedented Ebola crisis. Amnesty International staff and members in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in the region have experienced and confronted the tragedy directly. They have emphasized the human rights dimensions of this massive public health emergency; trying to prevent discrimination against specific groups and promote safety for health workers. 
  
Our solidarity is important here at home as well.  In 2004 we marked ten years since the launch of our Stolen Sisters report, bringing our solidarity to the struggle to address violence against Indigenous women in Canada.  Central to a decade of work has been standing with survivors, families and frontline activists, whose demands for justice have been ignored for far too long.    Their courage and determination has inspired our activism.  In turn, Amnesty’s activism has given them hope and strength. While the Canadian government has not agreed to launch a public inquiry leading to a national action plan; we are closer to that goal than ever. The tragic cases of two Cree teenage girls in Winnipeg this year – the murder of Tina Fontaine and brutal attack against Rinelle Harper – starkly reminded us why that matters so very much.	  
The world has certainly needed considerable solidarity on the human rights front in 2014.  
	Armed conflict and massive human rights violations claimed the lives of untold thousands of people and displaced millions, in Syria, northern Iraq, Ukraine, Gaza/Israel, South Sudan and the Central African Republic.  Amnesty was there.  
	Our researchers gathered firsthand testimonies and documented the truth about what was happening. We issued reports highlighting violations and abuses committed by both sides to the fighting.  We mobilized, across Canada and around the world. We called for arms embargos to keep weapons out of the hands of violators.  We pressed for justice, to break the impunity that protects war criminals.  We demanded protection, to keep refugees, the internally displaced and vulnerable civilians safe.  And we pushed Canada to take a consistent stand for human rights, expressing dismay about the government’s unwillingness to criticize human rights violations committed by Israeli forces in Gaza.     
	Amnesty’s candle has burned bright in many dark corners this year. Your support made that possible.	  
  
Our Stop Torture campaign is shining a light on a deeply-entrenched human rights crisis.  Six months into a two year campaign and we are already making a difference, such as when Ángel Colón walked free from his Mexican jail.  The release of the jarring US Senate Committee report documenting the brutal torture carried out by the US government during the so-called ‘war on terror’ was a stark reminder that our campaign is timely.  We will focus domestically also, including a push to convince Canada to ratify an important torture prevention treaty, the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture.  Fifty other Canadian organizations have joined us in a call to the Canadian government to do so within a year. 
Much of our human rights work has highlighted the ways that irresponsible business practices, short-sighted trade policies and lack of government regulation imperil human rights in Canada and around the world.  We continue to press for the land rights of Indigenous peoples to be protected amidst the influx of mining, pipeline, oil, gas and forestry companies into their territories.  We have taken that message to boardrooms, government offices, Parliament Hill, the Supreme Court and the United Nations.  
	We played a role in two ground-breaking decisions upholding the rights of the Tsilhqot’in people in BC this year.  But there were also ample reminders that there is still far to go.  The crucial right of ‘free, prior and informed consent’ was disregarded in the conditional approval granted for the Northern Gateway pipeline. And the annual Canada/Colombia free trade agreement human rights assessment ignored the grave crisis faced by Colombia’s Indigenous peoples.  
It has, been a difficult year for refugees.  But Amnesty members joined with concerned Canadians across the country in pressing for a recent spate of mean-spirited and restrictive measures to be repealed.  We enthusiastically welcomed a Federal Court ruling overturning punitive cuts to refugee health care and our volunteer lawyers are now preparing to intervene in the government’s appeal of that decision. 
	Our voice has also been loud and clear in urging Canada to make a generous commitment to resettle Syrian refugees to Canada. The UN has appealed for urgent assistance to ensure that vulnerable refugees receive the protection they require and the load is lightened for Syria’s overwhelmed neighbours, now sheltering 3.8 million refugees.  As the year ends we await word as to what the government will pledge. 
	We have spoken out for the rights of other groups too often left at the margins of Canadian society and for whom solidarity is so vital.  We were before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal supporting a discrimination complaint brought on behalf of First Nations children living on reserves.  We were in Parliament, pushing for adoption of laws to protect transgender individuals.   And we were in an Ontario court, backing up a call for a human rights approach to tackling homelessness.  Those legal pushes have been reinforced by letters, petitions and messages of solidarity, all of which will continue in 2015.	  
National security is back on the public agenda following the October attacks in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Ottawa.  Amnesty International has reminded the government that before rushing ahead with increased powers for security agencies, it is crucial to finally address Canada’s very worrying national security oversight gap.  Coming out of the 2006 public inquiry into Maher Arar’s case, the government has a well-developed proposal for national security review which has languished for years.  Joining together with a range of groups across the country Amnesty will push for action on this front in 2015. 
	Notably, there has been greater need than ever for solidarity among Canadian human rights groups and activists over the past year.  Concern mounts about various government measures that have targeted and punished organizations who disagree with laws and policies dealing with a number of issues, including environmental protection, the rights of Palestinians and gender equality.  With a growing number of groups hesitant to speak out because they worry about reprisal, solidarity is essential. 
Thank you for your solidarity and for standing strong for human rights this year. 
 Thank you for writing letters during our annual Write for Rights, gathering signatures on petitions at your school , retweeting and liking our Facebook and Twitter actions, organizing vigils alongside the families of murdered and missing Indigenous women, and sponsoring film nights.  Thank you for the countless other ways you have creatively and passionately spoken out for human rights. 
 Thank you also for your essential financial support.  Your donations have allowed us to send research teams into war-torn northern Iraq, displaced persons camps in South Sudan, and Mexican prison cells. Your generosity has made it possible for us to bring that research to life through campaigns and activism demanding change.   Your support is the very foundation of our human rights work; to live up to Ángel Colón’s challenge to us: don’t let down your guard.

When one cold morning...","On the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention against Torture, the man in charge of pushing states to stamp out the despicable practice, a torture survivor himself, looks back at his harrowing experience and the challenges facing the global fight against torture. 
 
	When one cold morning in 1975, young Argentinean human rights lawyer Juan Mendez saw two police officers vigorously walking towards him on a quiet street in Buenos Aires, he immediately knew he was in great danger. 
	It was a time of upheaval. As the violent military junta was in the process of taking power by force his work on behalf of political prisoners was a dangerous, life-threatening business. 
	Without uttering a word, the officers grabbed Juan, blindfolded him, shoved him into a car and took him to a police station. A few hours later they handed him over to the intelligence services. 
	“At the time I knew full well that all those accused of being ‘subversives’ were tortured ruthlessly. The first thing that came to my mind when the police took me is that I had to stay strong and not reveal anything that could lead to the detention and torture of other colleagues,” said Juan Mendez. 
	His suspicions were spot-on. The questioning, which went on for nearly three days, was ruthless. Interrogators electrocuted him while asking him about his work and the people he knew. They did the unthinkable to try and get him to reveal names, addresses, phone numbers and anything that would lead to more arrests and more torture.	On one occasion, an officer put a gun inside the Juan’s mouth and pulled the trigger. The gun was empty. 
	“I was very scared during the interrogations. Twice they had to call a doctor to check if they could continue torturing me without killing me. Only then did I realize that I could die. But when you are in that situation you live minute by minute, thinking of the moment when the torturers will get tired and stop so you can have a break,” he explained. 
	On the third day and without warning or an explanation, Juan was transferred to a prison. He was held there for 18 months, without charge, before being released and forced into exile. He was put on a plane and flown to France where he was reunited with his wife and young children, who were already living in exile. 
	“When I arrived in France I had mixed emotions as I knew I was leaving many people behind, in terrible situations. I was lucky to be able to leave but starting over with a young family was very hard,” he said. 
	“All the years I spent abroad I was obsessed with what was happening in Argentina. I moved to Washington and there I was in constant communication with human rights groups and became specialized in the issue of torture.” 
	Over the course of Argentina’s eight year-long violent dictatorship, thousands of people were arbitrarily arrested, taken to secret detention centres and tortured, many as punishment for their legitimate human rights work: 30,000 are still missing.	Similar stories of torture and other ill-treatment had been emerging from all corners of the world, but it wasn’t until the publication of Amnesty International’s ground-breaking study in 1973 that the true extent of the use of torture came to light. 
	The 225-page document kick-stated the world’s first ever global campaign against torture. Activists took to the streets demanding government action, celebrities started speaking out about the prevalence of the unlawful practice. It inspired lawyers to develop a convention that would provide concrete tools for preventing and prosecuting torture as an international crime. It was a treaty that would bind those states who had signed up to investigate torture wherever it happened, and bring those responsible to justice.	  
After years of serious, at times heated debate, the Convention against Torture was adopted at the 1984 United Nations General Assembly.	It was a landmark moment. “The Convention against Torture was a very significant milestone in the fight against torture because it incorporates very specific obligations on states to investigate, prosecute and punish every incident of torture,” Mendez said. 
	Among the 33 articles of the treaty, states agreed to create the Committee against Torture to oversee its implementation. In 1985, the post of Special Rapporteur on Torture was set up. Unlike the Convention, the Special Rapporteur’s mandate is not limited to those states that have joined it, but rather covers all UN member states. Any victim of torture or other ill-treatment can complain to the Special Rapporteur, who then writes to the government with questions and at the very least issues implicit demands for action. The Special Rapporteur visits prisons and prisoners all around the world (at states’ invitation) and reports to the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council annually.	In 2010, Juan Mendez was appointed as Special Rapporteur on Torture. The effects of  the challenge that the USA posed to the prohibition of torture in its response to the atrocities on 9/11 were still felt. 
	“Before 9/11 I think we had a clear consensus, a moral consensus around the world that torture was unacceptable and that there were no circumstance that could justify it. That is still true in legal terms, but in terms of the attitude of the public I think we have lost ground amongst fears of terrorism and common street crime. There is a sense that torture is inevitable, necessary and somehow acceptable,” Mendez explained. 
Mendez feels his job as Special Rapporteur on Torture is sometimes impossible. 
	Mandated with keeping 194 countries in check you would expect to see a well-staffed office with experts and administrative support. It is not. It is just Juan and a part time staff member. Sometimes it is like David fighting against Goliath. 
	“If we had more resources, we could do a lot more. We have a lot of financial restrictions as we can only do a couple of missions a year. But the main problem is the lack of support from governments,” he explained. 
	The lack of political will from governments who often ignore his requests to visit or turn them down without explanation is what frustrates him the most. 
	During his four years in office, Mendez has visited more than a dozen countries – including Mexico, Tajikistan, Morocco, Tunisia and Kyrgyzstan. Many others have shut the door on him – such as Bahrain and Guatemala — or even failed to respond to his requests. 
	Part of Mendez’s job is to persuade governments to agree to his visits, on his terms. He insists on having unlimited access to all detention facilities and be able to speak to anybody held there, unaccompanied by officials. But many governments do not agree to being inspected. 
	“Some experiences have been very frustrating. For example, I have just returned from a visit to Gambia and after arriving the government changed the terms of the visit which we could not accept so we ended up not visiting the prisons. The US government has also been challenging. I have been asking to visit Guantánamo for three years and they have accepted but say I would not be able to talk to any of the inmates so I was not able to accept that. Also, they have never responded to my request to visit prisons inside US territory.” 
	When visits take place, Mendez puts together a highly qualified team of consultants and volunteers including researchers, lawyers and forensic experts who travel with him. 
	They inspect prisons, pre-trial detention centres, police stations, mental health institutions and immigration detention centres speaking to inmates in private about the treatment they receive. While the visit to the country is coordinated with the government, visits to specific prisons are unannounced so authorities never know where and when the team will knock on their door. 
Mendez says the struggle against torture is an uphill one but acknowledged there have been many successes.	Solitary confinement is now widely considered a form of ill-treatment and some countries have adopted laws to ban torture. 
	He says that many challenges remain before torture is truly stamped out. 
	“The only real way to eliminate torture is to ensure those responsible are brought to justice. It is torture’s cycle of impunity that keeps it alive. The Convention was a very positive development but the real challenge is to ensure States take aggressive and decisive action to end torture. It will not happen overnight but it can happen,” Mendez said.

,  
, 	When one cold morning in 1975, young Argentinean human rights lawyer Juan Mendez saw two police officers vigorously walking towards him on a quiet street in Buenos Aires, he immediately knew he was in great danger. 
,  
	It was a time of upheaval. As the violent military junta was in the process of taking power by force his work on behalf of political prisoners was a dangerous, life-threatening business. 
,  
	Without uttering a word, the officers grabbed Juan, blindfolded him, shoved him into a car and took him to a police station. A few hours later they handed him over to the intelligence services. 
,  
	“At the time I knew full well that all those accused of being ‘subversives’ were tortured ruthlessly. The first thing that came to my mind when the police took me is that I had to stay strong and not reveal anything that could lead to the detention and torture of other colleagues,” said Juan Mendez. 
,  
	His suspicions were spot-on. The questioning, which went on for nearly three days, was ruthless. Interrogators electrocuted him while asking him about his work and the people he knew. They did the unthinkable to try and get him to reveal names, addresses, phone numbers and anything that would lead to more arrests and more torture. 
, 	On one occasion, an officer put a gun inside the Juan’s mouth and pulled the trigger. The gun was empty. 
,  
	“I was very scared during the interrogations. Twice they had to call a doctor to check if they could continue torturing me without killing me. Only then did I realize that I could die. But when you are in that situation you live minute by minute, thinking of the moment when the torturers will get tired and stop so you can have a break,” he explained. 
,  
	On the third day and without warning or an explanation, Juan was transferred to a prison. He was held there for 18 months, without charge, before being released and forced into exile. He was put on a plane and flown to France where he was reunited with his wife and young children, who were already living in exile. 
,  
	“When I arrived in France I had mixed emotions as I knew I was leaving many people behind, in terrible situations. I was lucky to be able to leave but starting over with a young family was very hard,” he said. 
,  
	“All the years I spent abroad I was obsessed with what was happening in Argentina. I moved to Washington and there I was in constant communication with human rights groups and became specialized in the issue of torture.” 
,  
	Over the course of Argentina’s eight year-long violent dictatorship, thousands of people were arbitrarily arrested, taken to secret detention centres and tortured, many as punishment for their legitimate human rights work: 30,000 are still missing. 
, 	Similar stories of torture and other ill-treatment had been emerging from all corners of the world, but it wasn’t until the publication of Amnesty International’s ground-breaking study in 1973 that the true extent of the use of torture came to light. 
,  
	The 225-page document kick-stated the world’s first ever global campaign against torture. Activists took to the streets demanding government action, celebrities started speaking out about the prevalence of the unlawful practice. It inspired lawyers to develop a convention that would provide concrete tools for preventing and prosecuting torture as an international crime. It was a treaty that would bind those states who had signed up to investigate torture wherever it happened, and bring those responsible to justice. 
, 	  
,  
,  
After years of serious, at times heated debate, the Convention against Torture was adopted at the 1984 United Nations General Assembly. 
, 	It was a landmark moment. “The Convention against Torture was a very significant milestone in the fight against torture because it incorporates very specific obligations on states to investigate, prosecute and punish every incident of torture,” Mendez said. 
,  
	Among the 33 articles of the treaty, states agreed to create the Committee against Torture to oversee its implementation. In 1985, the post of Special Rapporteur on Torture was set up. Unlike the Convention, the Special Rapporteur’s mandate is not limited to those states that have joined it, but rather covers all UN member states. Any victim of torture or other ill-treatment can complain to the Special Rapporteur, who then writes to the government with questions and at the very least issues implicit demands for action. The Special Rapporteur visits prisons and prisoners all around the world (at states’ invitation) and reports to the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council annually. 
, 	In 2010, Juan Mendez was appointed as Special Rapporteur on Torture. The effects of  the challenge that the USA posed to the prohibition of torture in its response to the atrocities on 9/11 were still felt. 
,  
	“Before 9/11 I think we had a clear consensus, a moral consensus around the world that torture was unacceptable and that there were no circumstance that could justify it. That is still true in legal terms, but in terms of the attitude of the public I think we have lost ground amongst fears of terrorism and common street crime. There is a sense that torture is inevitable, necessary and somehow acceptable,” Mendez explained.

“I have two of them now!” Jabeur Mejri is smiling and pointing at a flick book containing hundreds of photos of support taken by Amnesty International members. They were passed to Jabeur and his family while he was in prison in Tunisia over the last two years. 
Jabeur was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in March 2012, for Facebook posts deemed offensive to Islam and the prophet Mohamed. “Prison was difficult,” he tells us. “The other prisoners used to harass me and beat me because of my views and none of the prison guards did anything to protect me.” 
After Jabeur was jailed, Amnesty supporters worldwide came together to push for his release. Thousands signed petitions and hundreds more sent messages of support to him and his family. Campaigners took to the streets in Tunisia and across the world. And many wrote letters to authorities as part of Write for Rights 2013, Amnesty’s global letter writing marathon. All the time, our team stayed in touch with Jabeur’s family and lawyers, checking that Jabeur was OK and looking for any developments in his case. 
Finally, after exactly two years in prison and months of empty promises, he was pardoned by President Moncef Marzouki in March this year. “I saw the news that I had been pardoned on television,” he says. “No one in prison told me.” 
Jabeur was arrested again in April, and sentenced to another eight-and-a-half months in prison for insulting a public official. He tells us that he got into an argument with the official when he believed the man had given him the wrong information. Thankfully, in October 2014 he was released again by a presidential pardon. Jabeur’s release is provisional, as there is still a case against him relating to accusations of theft which he strongly denies. 
Despite his release, Jabeur does not feel free. “I’m afraid when I’m in the street that someone will hurt me or that I’ll be put in prison again,” he says. “And I’m afraid for my parents, who have already endured so much in these two years. I’m also scared for my future, I want to have a future and to work and have a family but I’m worried I won’t be able to here.” 
Jabeur is scared because of attitudes in Tunisia to his views on religion. In fact, President Marzouki tried to justify delaying his release by saying that groups who found Jabeur’s views offensive might attack him. Repression and restrictions on free expression were a hallmark of Tunisia under the regime of president Ben Ali, but now a new government will soon have a chance to ensure that people like Jabeur Mejri feel safe to peacefully voice their opinions free from threats or intimidation.

As this year’s Write for Rights begins, Jabeur’s case shows how your words and messages of support can really change lives for the better. Before we leave, he tells us just how big a difference your support makes. 
“Things got better when there was more attention on my case and some activists and lawyers came to visit me in prison,” he says. “Amnesty International’s support had a great impact, I’m very happy you raised awareness about my case, not just with your activists but amongst the Tunisian public as well.”

This past Saturday on December 6th, supporters of Amnesty International took to the streets in Montreal to be a part of the largest grassroots human rights campaign in the world, Write for Rights! The new flagship event, dubbed “Dance for Rights” brought community members out to dance in solidarity with people fighting injustices all over the world, and to promote and protect human rights. With our music devices in our pockets and headphones in our ears we became a SILENT DISCO, using a flash mob style of street activism to garner attention! 
 
Dance for Rights, supported by both the Anglophone and Francophone branches of Amnesty International Canada, was organized by the Silent Disco Squad and Amnesty’s Montreal Youth Organizer, Valérie Savaria (pictured right). For over an hour, we danced through streets, parks, sidewalks and crowds! 
 Support from people, passing cars, buses, and local police was overwhelming! 
	We were cheered on and were asked questions wherever we went! The event culminated in a ground stomping dance in front of Place des Arts, the location of the Amnesty Francophone’s annual Write for Rights event, with local drummers providing a striking sound, drawing in crowds who signed petitions and engaged with our dancers! 
With the 25th anniversary of the Montreal Massacre, and the call to end violence against women, Amnesty International’s message of protecting human rights and celebrating International Human Rights Day resonated in Montreal. People were enthusiastic and motivated to take part in an event to show the world that with everyone’s support, we can end injustices occurring in our own country and countries over.

In early 2011 he travelled to Sudan to open a small restaurant to help support his ailing father. He knew a few well-connected people in Khartoum with whom he had gone to school in north London. It all made sense at the time. 
But then, it went horribly wrong. 
Two weeks after his plane landed, he was languishing in a prison cell, bearing the marks and scars of torture. 
Despite his ordeal Magdy is lucky. He is now safely back in the UK, fighting a legal battle against the Sudanese state. 
He is arguing that Sudan violated the prohibition of torture under the African Charter and is using the Convention against Torture – adopted three decades ago this year – to do it. 
Madgy’s story illustrates why the Convention against Torture is crucial in the fight for justice for thousands like him. The document provides a clear definition of what torture is and sets out the obligations that state parties have to end it. 
Even though Sudan has yet to ratify it, it has an obligation under international law to bring those responsible for torture to justice and Madgy is attempting to ensure it does just that. 
Soon after arriving in Khartoum he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Madgy landed in Khartoum on 27 January 2011. Little did he know that protests which had begun in Egypt a couple of days earlier were going to transform the political landscape of the region – and his life. 
The protests in Egypt were seen by many as an opportunity for justice but the Government of Sudan saw them as potential threat to its rule. 
Madgy remembers his arrival in Khartoum with a smile but the pleasant days didn’t last long. 
On the evening of 14 February, he was cooking chicken and beans for dinner at his rented flat in the Sudanese capital when 20 armed men kicked his door down and stormed in. Shouting at Magdy in Arabic, a language he could not understand, he was blindfolded, shackled and taken away. 
Only later did the young man realize he was being taken to the offices of Sudan’s infamous National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). 
“At the time I didn’t know what to do. I was shocked. For a long time I thought the whole thing was a joke, that everything would be cleared up quickly,” he said. 
Questioning began as soon as he arrived at the NISS’s headquarters. 
They accused him of being a spy for the Israeli government and an activist who was fomenting a revolution in Sudan. 
“They kept people held there blindfolded and shackled by the feet nearly the whole time. There was no food or water. The cell was very small and extremely hot and they would only bring us a mouthful of water now and then,” Magdy explained. 
He spent eight days in the cells of the intelligence services’ building. 
His relatives did not know where he was and there was not a lawyer in sight. 
Then he was transferred to Kober Prison, notorious for its brutal methods of interrogation. 
Intelligence officers had only one thing in mind. They wanted him to confess to being a spy. And they were prepared to do anything to achieve their goal. 
“I had bruises everywhere. There was no way to defend myself because I could not see who was hitting me, I could only hear them. They would only stop when they got tired. One time they beat me so badly I was not even able to walk afterwards, they even broke some of my teeth,” he said. 
Magdy was held in a tiny two by three metre cell with several other men, also accused of being activists or spies. 
“Officers would come with big [plastic] pipes. I remember there were two children [there], maybe 16 or 17 years old and they beat them in front of everyone for a long time until these kids defecated. That is very difficult to watch, a child being beaten by a grown man to the point where they start bleeding. There was no remorse, they did not hold back.” 
“When people were taken away for interrogation, they would come back in a terrible state. In those situations I didn’t know what I was supposed to do, how to help them. Some guys were bleeding, some even from the anus,” he explained. 
Magdy spent eight months in prison. Not knowing if he would ever see the world again. Then one day, as he was sitting on the floor of his small cell, back against the wall, a guard came in and without warning or an explanation, just said: “You are free to go”. 
He spent the following two months with his friends, trying to recover. 
“By the time I came out I had lost a lot of weight. I was not able to sleep or eat. For months I had to take sleeping pills and stayed in one room.” 
Luckily, as a British citizen, Magdy could rely on the help of a foreign government to assist with his release. With aid from the British embassy in Sudan, he was eventually allowed to leave Sudan and fly back to the UK on 30 December 2011. 
“I was very relieved to be home, to be in a safe environment. But I could not help feeling bad for the people who were still there.” 
Since being back, he has been working to help bring to light the widespread use of torture in Sudan. 
He is now fighting a case against the Sudanese State together with the international human rights organization REDRESS for those responsible for his torture to be brought to justice. 
The case is pending before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights – Africa’s main human rights body – who is reviewing the claims after the Sudanese state has failed to investigate Magdy’s complaint about his torture. 
Magdy doesn’t have high hopes for justice but he says pursuing the case is crucial to make sure the abuses he and others suffered come to light. 
“I do not let this experience affect me negatively. I’m more focused and determined than ever to find justice. I will not let this break me,” he said.

Her daughter, 22-year-old Liao Minyue, tells their story. 
  
My mother, Liu Ping, was just an ordinary Chinese woman with a kind heart. 
We were very close. I chose to live with her after my parents divorced about 10 years back. We never fought, not even once. We used to go to the markets to collect old and unwanted vegetables for food. It never once struck me as anything to be ashamed of. On the contrary, those were warm and intimate times, because we were together. 
But one night, everything changed. My mum was moonlighting as a street vendor in the evenings to supplement her monthly income of RMB 800 (GBP80) as an iron and steel plant worker. 
Troublemakers turned up at her stall and my uncle tried to help. He was badly beaten up. 
Local authorities ignored the incident, but a group of lawyers stepped in to	resolve the case free of charge. The kindness they showed sparked my	mum’s activism – she began actively advocating for workers’ rights. 
My mum started giving speeches on the streets and distributing flyers. She also tried to run for the local People’s Congress as an independent candidate so she could help workers who had been forced to retire. She was away from home for days at a stretch. 
Strangers whom I now realise were plainclothes police would turn up at our door. I worried about her, especially when I couldn’t reach her – that usually meant she had been beaten up. I was completely against what she was doing and tried everything to stop her. The police and local party officials would also approach me in a bid to get her to stop what she was doing. 
I had no idea what she was involved in. She protected me by not telling me about it. There was talk in the neighbourhood that she was up to no good, and I started believing what I heard. Our relationship became badly strained as a result. 
Then last year, my mum and two other anti-corruption activists, were arrested for holding a small private gathering and displaying a banner demanding that government officials make their assets – like property and investments – public. After that, I lost faith in the Chinese Communist party, and I posted an open letter online announcing my withdrawal from it. I was prepared to face the consequences. 
Mum and the other two activists are said to be linked to the New Citizens’ Movement, a loose network of human rights activists. When she was sentenced to six and a half years in prison in June, I was outraged. I posted another letter online, expressing my deep disappointment. 
Over the past year, I’ve been reflecting on my earlier attitude to my mum’s activism. I deeply regret trying to stop her. What my mum and the rest are facing are the direct consequences of all our apathy and cowardice. 
Now I have no qualms about accepting interviews with the media to talk about her. My passport has been revoked and I faced pressure from the authorities in my previous job, but I’m not afraid if I face a little harassment because of it. After all, I’ve only got one mother.

We interviewed Lorelei as part of a series of conversations with Indigenous women activists marking the 10th anniversary of our 2004 Stolen Sisters report. 
1.      What was the idea behind Butterflies in Spirit? 
On October 4th 2011, I was at a vigil for Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women. I was there by myself. Molly Dixon had gotten up to speak about her daughter Angeline Pete who recently went missing in May 2011. When she spoke I couldn’t help but cry. Someone saw me crying, they came over, gave me a big hug, and a poster. This poster had newspaper clippings glued all over it. I noticed people trying to read what was on my poster. I didn’t even know what was on my poster, I just knew it had to do with missing and murdered women. A thought came to me about how I could get my missing Aunt Belinda Williams’ picture out there. 
I pictured my Missing Aunt’s picture on a black t-shirt. Then I thought, I also have to remember and honour my cousin Tanya Holyk who went missing in 1996. Her DNA was later found on Robert Pickton’s Farm. Then I thought, I can walk around with a t-shirt, but I wanted a way to draw attention to the t-shirt, and the issue of Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls. Then I thought of dance. 
I’m not a dancer myself, but I knew this would get somebody’s attention. Beyonce’s song “Who Run the World, Girls!” got my attention and I knew that had to be the song. I thought of it as a way to empower women, youth and girls. I could actually picture the dance in my head. I could see it. 
I shared this idea with a few people and they loved it. My Aunty Carrie started talking about it to people and it just took off from there. Family and friends of Missing and Murdered Aboriginal women heard about the idea they wanted to join the troupe as well. 
2.      Butterflies in Spirit has performed on Vancouver streets as a flash mob. What kind of reaction do you get? 
Shock, empowerment, and a lot of people were actually very amazed by the performance. 
When people heard about the idea, a lot of people wanted to support us. However, some people didn’t think it was a great idea. I heard things like, “a bunch of girls are going to take over the street and do a dance?!” After we did the performance those same people couldn’t believe the message we were sending. Especially when we incorporated the medicine wheel in our performance and the graphic ending when we lay down on the street one by one and get covered by sheets which is supposed to represent all the murdered Aboriginal women in body bags. 
3.      Do you think that there’s momentum building on the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women? 
I think the momentum is definitely building on the issue of Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women. Especially with more leaders supporting us and calling for a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered  Aboriginal Women and Girls across Canada. Butterflies in Spirit hasn’t been performing for a little while now with our busy lives and stuff. However, within the past couple of weeks our facebook page has been getting several hundreds of likes and I haven’t even been promoting it or anything. I’m shocked! Two weeks ago we had over new 400 likes, last week just over 100 and this week over 300. 
4.      What is the most important thing that you would like to see done to support the families of missing and murdered women? 
A National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls Across Canada! We need to get to the root causes of why this is happening here in CANADA! We need to raise awareness of this issue so this doesn’t happen to anymore families. We need healing programs for families of Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls. We also have to take preventative measures across Canada to make sure this does not happen anymore. 
How do so many Aboriginal Women and Girls go missing without a trace? This has happened to my family four times. How does this happen to my family four times!!! My Aunt Belinda Williams has been missing since 1977. My Cousin Tanya Holyk went missing in 1996 but her DNA was later found on Robert Pickton’s Farm. A man who police say had attacked and killed other women took my cousin Doreen Green into the mountains and raped her, but luckily she was able to escape. And my aunt who was pushed out of a hotel room in the Downtown Eastside, thankfully she survived this fall.  This has got to STOP!

It is time for the Obama administration to ensure implementation of standardized sexual assault policies aimed at helping ensure that Indigenous survivors of sexual violence  can access medical treatment and support services. Indigenous women face disproportionately high levels of rape and sexual violence. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) compiled statistics that show over one in three Native American and Alaska Native women will be raped during their lifetimes. They are also 2.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than women in the USA in general. 
In order to achieve justice, survivors frequently have to navigate a maze of tribal, state and federal law. These complex jurisdictional rules undermine equality before the law and often allow perpetrators to evade justice. At all levels, law enforcement and justice systems are failing to ensure justice for Indigenous survivors of sexual violence – their cases may not be investigated, vital evidence may not be collected via a “rape kit” and their cases may never be prosecuted. 
In response, the Tribal Law and Order Act, passed into law in 2010, required the Indian Health Service to develop standardized sexual assault policies and protocols.. Unfortunately, while these protocols have been developed they have not been effectively implemented.  These protocols and policies are vital in ensuring that Indigenous women receive the services that they need following a sexual assault, including ensuring that vital evidence is collected and that survivors have access to emergency contraception. 
When the Tribal Law and Order Act was signed, Lisa Iyotte bravely told the U.S. House of Representatives her story of how the system failed her when she needed it most. One night when she was living on the reservation, she was violently beaten and raped in her home in the presence of her two young daughters. At the IHS hospital, “no one asked me aboutthe rape and I had to wait all night for someone to collectthe DNA evidence from the attack.” Iyotte said. Although a suspect was identified, federal authorities refused to get involved because no weapons were used. Several months later, the same man attacked another woman, but he was never prosecuted for raping Lisa Iyotte. The Tribal Law and Order Act is supposed to rectify these problems to ensure that women like Lisa receive the standardized sexual assault care they need and that their cases do not fall through the cracks. 
At the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Obama said, “What matters far more than words – what matters far more than any resolution or declaration – are actions to match those words.” 
The President must live up to his commitment to take action and be at the front of the effort to support Indigenous women and take sexual assault head on. 
Tell President Obama to take action to ensure that Indian Health Services adopts and enforces standardized sexual assault protocols that include full and equal access to Emergency Contraception. 
Take action to ensure the President takes action by implementing the new policies and ensuring they are enforced.

It’s not just any fence, but the one that surrounds the Chief Minister’s residence in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, where Bhopal is the capital. She is among a group of protesters demanding that the minister keep his promise of providing each survivor of the 1984 gas leak – the more than 570,000 who were exposed – 500,000 Indian rupees (US$8,170) as compensation. 
Shahzadi, aged 60, lives in Blue Moon Colony, one of the 22 slums that surround the old pesticide factory formerly owned by Union Carbide India Limited. This area is blighted by water contamination, caused by chemicals from the abandoned factory site. 
The disaster overturned her and her family’s lives. “Everyone has dreams,” she says. “I too had those. My dream was not about becoming a teacher or doctor… I wished that we would provide a good education to our children… but the gas leak shattered all these dreams.” 
 
Shahzadi, her husband and four children were all afflicted by the 1984 leak. As parents, she says, they were unable to take care of their children in the immediate wake of the disaster because they themselves were incapacitated. Her eldest son and two daughters still suffer from chest pain. 
She had two other children after the incident, both of whom are ill. “My daughter couldn’t conceive for four years after her marriage,” she says, noting that it was only after treatment at Sambhavna Clinic, set up especially for Bhopal survivors, that this changed. “Otherwise,” she continues, “doctors had told her clearly that ‘since you have been drinking this toxic water, you will not be able to give birth.” 
Her 22-year-old son is unable to do heavy work, she says. “All these problems, such as irritated eyes, kidney failure, respiratory diseases, lung cancers… are found commonly in almost every home of gas victims. This is the situation in all 22 slums.” She adds that women and girls experience problems with their menstrual cycle. 
As Shahzadi Bi points out, many people born after the tragedy experienced similar symptoms to those who were exposed to the leak. Local activists say this is a result of being born to gas affected parents as well as being exposed to toxic water.	Despite all these ailments – or perhaps because of them – Shahzadi is now a member of a number of campaigning groups, including the Stationary Workers Association and the Bhopal Gas Victims Struggle Committee. 
“We did many demonstrations and carried out many rallies, burnt many effigies, sat on hunger strikes, carried out two marches on foot from Bhopal to Delhi, in 2006 and 2008,” explains Shahzadi. “In 2006, we raised the issue of toxicity in ground water of these 22 slums. The government listened to us and agreed to provide us clean water from the Narmada pipeline.” 
The clean water didn’t arrive right away – that took another three years and another march to Delhi, too. Still, it’s a significant win in the 30-year campaign. 
“Now our struggle is against the injustice meted out to gas victims and victims of toxicity in water,” says Shahzadi. 
The Bhopal struggle for justice has been largely led by women. Shahzadi feels that this is because of their unique position in the family. “Women see the pain of our children every single moment,” she says. “That is the reason women feel so attached to the struggle – to better the lives of the next generation. 
For these women and for men, too, the struggle has been long and the obstacles many. Activists’ calls are simple, says Shahzadi. They want proper compensation for victims of the gas leak as well as for those affected by water contamination. They also want the government to ensure that the toxic waste that was left behind is cleaned up.	But, she says, survivors can’t do it alone. “If you show solidarity and support, our determination to fight will be boosted. We will not feel alone anymore.”

Now aged 90, she began her struggle in the wake of the disaster. In 1984 she was living with her son and his wife in a shanty near the factory. Her daughter-in-law died during the gas leak. INDIA: ACTION FOR SURVIVORS ON 30TH ANNIVERSARY...","Now aged 90, she began her struggle in the wake of the disaster. In 1984 she was living with her son and his wife in a shanty near the factory. Her daughter-in-law died during the gas leak. 
 
Rampyari took up the struggle for justice and fair compensation, which she maintains she has yet to receive.  “We are suffering from very many illnesses, of stomach, of arms and legs, of eyes… and all that they have given me is Rs25,000 (around US$400). They say: ‘You are not a gas victim.’ I ask them, ‘If I didn’t suffer from the gas leak, why do I have so many diseases?” 
In 1989, survivors were awarded US$470 million in compensation – an amount that fell far short of estimates of the damage at the time. One independent estimate put the cost of medical research, treatment, economic rehabilitation and legal costs at just over US$4.1 billion. 
Rampyari developed oral cancer, among a list of other difficulties including breathlessness and joint pain – two common complaints among gas survivors. Yet, despite her many health concerns and her advanced years, she continues to protest, enduring beatings and injury. She says simply that protesting keeps her alive. 
Rampyari’s journey to becoming an activist has been a long one. A difficult one, too.  With no formal education and from a working class background, she had no previous involvement in social justice causes. 
“I am just an illiterate person,” she says. I haven’t learnt anything, can’t even differentiate between short and long [vowels]. If I were literate, I would have done a lot of things, but now what do I do? I can only speak my mind.” 
And so she does. She speaks her mind over and over, never mincing words when it comes to the community’s demands.	“We demand that there shall be medical treatment for us,” she says. “We also must get our compensation money. We gas victims must be given a monthly pension – at least a thousand rupees. This is our demand and we will definitely fight for this. How do we survive, when we can’t work anymore to earn our bread?” 
Rampyari is intensely aware of her role in spurring new generations to action for Bhopal. She worries that the effects of living with water and soil contamination from the decaying pesticide factory have left many far younger than her with health defects. And so, her advice to those following in her path, is unflinching. 
“We went for protests at many places and had so many rallies,” she says. “Now [others] don’t have to face the torture that we faced in the past. We faced such brutal repression that we virtually walked over thorns. We swam across drains, had to run away when police ran behind us, but we didn’t step away from this struggle. I tell this to everyone – my sisters, brothers, mothers and daughters – that they must learn from our struggle. They must have courage and never step behind in the struggle.”

Rampyari took up the struggle for justice and fair compensation, which she maintains she has yet to receive.  “We are suffering from very many illnesses, of stomach, of arms and legs, of eyes… and all that they have given me is Rs25,000 (around US$400). They say: ‘You are not a gas victim.’ I ask them, ‘If I didn’t suffer from the gas leak, why do I have so many diseases?” 
,  
In 1989, survivors were awarded US$470 million in compensation – an amount that fell far short of estimates of the damage at the time. One independent estimate put the cost of medical research, treatment, economic rehabilitation and legal costs at just over US$4.1 billion. 
,  
Rampyari developed oral cancer, among a list of other difficulties including breathlessness and joint pain – two common complaints among gas survivors. Yet, despite her many health concerns and her advanced years, she continues to protest, enduring beatings and injury. She says simply that protesting keeps her alive. 
,  
Rampyari’s journey to becoming an activist has been a long one. A difficult one, too.  With no formal education and from a working class background, she had no previous involvement in social justice causes. 
,  
“I am just an illiterate person,” she says. I haven’t learnt anything, can’t even differentiate between short and long [vowels]. If I were literate, I would have done a lot of things, but now what do I do? I can only speak my mind.” 
,  
And so she does. She speaks her mind over and over, never mincing words when it comes to the community’s demands. 
, 	“We demand that there shall be medical treatment for us,” she says. “We also must get our compensation money. We gas victims must be given a monthly pension – at least a thousand rupees. This is our demand and we will definitely fight for this. How do we survive, when we can’t work anymore to earn our bread?” 
,  
Rampyari is intensely aware of her role in spurring new generations to action for Bhopal. She worries that the effects of living with water and soil contamination from the decaying pesticide factory have left many far younger than her with health defects. And so, her advice to those following in her path, is unflinching. 
,  
“We went for protests at many places and had so many rallies,” she says. “Now [others] don’t have to face the torture that we faced in the past. We faced such brutal repression that we virtually walked over thorns. We swam across drains, had to run away when police ran behind us, but we didn’t step away from this struggle. I tell this to everyone – my sisters, brothers, mothers and daughters – that they must learn from our struggle. They must have courage and never step behind in the struggle.”

Earlier this week, many people around the world waited with bated breath for a grand jury’s decision in a case where a police officer shot dead an unarmed young black man on the street. While the 9 August shooting of Michael Brown took place in the US suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, the case has a deep resonance here in Brazil. The tragic course of events leading up to the teenager’s death could just as easily have played out on the streets of our cities or favelas. 
Of the 56,000 homicides in Brazil every year, 30,000 are young people aged 15 to 29. That means that, at this very moment, a young person is most likely being killed in Brazil. By the time you go to bed, 82 will have died today. It’s like a small airplane full of young people crashing every two days, with no survivors. This would be shocking enough by itself, but it’s even more scandalous that 77 per cent of these young people are black. 
Since 1980, more than 1 million people have been murdered in Brazil. According to Global Burden of Armed Violence 2008, in the period from 2004 to 2007, more people were killed here than in the 12 main wars worldwide. 
However the violence doesn’t impact Brazilian society equally. Murders are rampant in poor and marginalized communities. Prejudice and negative stereotypes associated with the favelas and city outskirts have a key role in perpetrating this violence. 
Brazil’s international human rights obligations require it to take effective steps to protect the right to life and address racial discrimination, including by ensuring that its policing practices don’t entrench racial disparities. 
On 20 November, Brazil celebrated Black Awareness Day. It’s a date when people recognize the important contributions of Afro-descendants and the need to tackle discrimination and its negative consequences. Groups that defend the rights of Brazil’s black people are actually growing in number and reach. But part of society is still in denial about the impact of lethal violence on our youth. 
Even though they are gunned down in massive numbers, young black people have become invisible in Brazil, either because residents of their neighbourhoods have become used to seeing so many deaths or because the problem is out of sight of those who can take action to change this dire situation. They are also victims of the state’s “war on drugs” and a militarized police force that targets young people, and black youth in particular, as potential enemies. Brazil’s police homicide rate is among the world’s highest. 
Sadly, this situation seems to have been simply accepted as normal in Brazil. Lawmakers don’t prioritize it as part of the national public agenda, with many shying away from the issue during the recent electoral debate. Having become so commonplace, it’s also out of the headlines. 
This is unacceptable and something must be done. That’s why, earlier this month, Amnesty International Brazil launched a campaign called Young Black Alive (Jovem Negro Vivo). We want to keep our young people alive and firmly believe that we can change this reality. Don’t you?

Amnesty International Canada and the Egyptian Canadian Coalition for Democracy have co-authored the following statement of solidarity: 
We, the undersigned student associations and clubs, are following closely the situation in Egypt and the violation of the basic human rights of Egyptian students in universities all over Egypt since the start of the school year there in October. 
Universities should be celebrated as a place for debate and dissent. Instead, student activism has been stifled and crushed. The Egyptian authorities have imposed strict security measures on campuses and used excessive force – including shooting tear gas inside buildings and firing shotguns randomly – to put down protests. At least one student in Alexandria died as a result of injuries from shotgun pellets in October, with another 90 students injured and some 200 arrested. 
Any use of force in the policing of demonstrations, even when they have turned violent or are regarded by the authorities as illegal, must comply with international law. 
We stand in solidarity with Egyptian students’ right to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly, and to a campus environment that is free from fear, intimidation and police abuse. 
We call on the Canadian Government, civil society and human rights groups to exert all possible pressure on the Egyptian authorities to:

article by Adriana Dragomir, Media Intern – AI Toronto Film Team 
	Being forced to say words that not only misrepresent your beliefs and actions but are meant to justify torture and imprisonment for wrongdoings you never committed feels like rape, argues writer Faraj Sarkoohi early on in “Forced Confessions,” Maziar Bahari’s film about the Islamic regime of Iran’s decades-long practice of broadcasting televised coerced confessions. Sarkoohi does not take his comparisons lightly: recorded in his bedroom while making love to his wife, he was forced to match the orgasmic noises on tape while being physically tortured. The memory of pain overlaps with that of an intimate, pleasurable connection refusing the prisoner the chance at mental escape. 
Siamak Pourzand committed suicide as a way of defying the regime after years of house arrest and of testifying against the physical and psychological torture to which he was subjected. A journalist and creator of cine clubs where Western films were shown, Pourzand was called a ‘pimp’ and declared a corruptor of youth simply because in Persian ‘cine’ means ‘breasts.’ Student activist Ali Afshari was put through a mock execution before he was forced to confess publicly that his actions served the interests of foreign powers. Journalist Omid Memarian and philosopher Ramin Jahanbegloo were also coerced into admitting that they pursued subversive activities. Finally, the film’s director, Iranian Canadian journalist and filmmaker Maziar Bahari, was imprisoned and his forced admission of being a spy for foreign intelligence agencies and of promoting a revolution in Iran was televised and broadcasted internationally.  
The protagonists’ intellectual ties to Western culture are exploited by a repressive regime that perceives foreignness as threat, much like the Communist regimes to which it ironically compares itself in a media montage meant to accuse Jahanbegloo of instigating a ‘soft overthrow.’ The strategy aims to present them as different and not belonging to, or serving the interests of, the people of Iran. Never do these men try to justify their political stances, nor their confessions through the pressure of torture. While admitting to the limits of the body, the intangibility of the soul is a theme that transpires in each and every interview. Sarkoohi’s description of a state of bliss and absolute privilege when Beethoven appeared to conduct a symphony just for him at the moment between life and death elevates the film from its role as act of reparatory justice to that of testimony for a human spiritual cohesion that transcends nation, religion and time. 
“Forced Confessions” is screened at Amnesty International’s REEL Awareness Film Festival, Sunday, November 23rd, 3:30 PM at the Carlton Cinema, 20 Carlton Street, Toronto. Guest speakers are Siamak Pourzand’s daughter, Lily Pourzand, Iran death row survivor Hamid Ghassemi-Shall and philosopher and author Ramin Jahanbegloo.

by Adriana Dragomir, Media Intern – AI Toronto Film Team 
Extraordinary stories of courage and resilience interweave to make Nima Sarvestani’s feature-length documentary “No Burqas Behind Bars” a compelling picture of the paradoxes of control and freedom in present-day Afghanistan. 
In Takhar prison, forty women cramped in four small rooms serve long terms for ‘moral crimes’ – fleeing forced or abusive marriages. Sima was sentenced to 15 years for trying to escape her extremely violent husband who beat another wife and her child to death. Nadjibe fled while pregnant because her husband’s beatings endangered her unborn child. Sara is in love. She fled with Javid, the young man she hopes to marry upon her release and who is only a wall-thickness away from her, in the male section of the prison. She can see him every day if she can make a large-enough hole and hide it from the guards. These women risked being dishonoured and killed in order to save their unborn and young children’s lives or to give themselves a chance at love. 
Paradoxically, the highly-restricted environment of Takhar provides a safe haven where they can raise their children, where – no longer having to wear identity-erasing burqas – they can tell their side of the story, ignored by the law, bond over shared pain and establish authentic relationships among themselves and with the outside world. The fairness of the long terms is never questioned. In fact, these women fear release. Free to return to their homes, they are in more danger than ever before. The perception that they have undermined the authority and public image of their husbands and brothers is no less than a sentence to death. Still, the prisoners take pride in having the courage to stand up to their abusers. Within the confines of a high-security prison they feel safe to express the inner sense of freedom that led them to flee their seemingly desirable homes in order to stay true to themselves. 
In a context that favours the trampling of their rights and freedoms, the film’s courageous protagonists have the strength to carry on, give comfort to others and hope for a better future. This is a must-see film that testifies to the strength of the human spirit in face of incredible adversity. 
	“No Burqas Behind Bars” is screened in première in Canada at Amnesty International’s REEL Awareness Film Festival, Saturday, November 22nd, 2014 at 6 pm at the Carlton Cinema, 20 Carlton Street, Toronto.

Eight years after being ousted from power, in October 1998, Augusto Pinochet, the ailing Chilean former leader and one of the world’s most notorious dictators, decided to travel to Europe to receive medical treatment. 
But as he arrived in London, members of the Chilean diaspora – many of them survivors of torture during Pinochet’s brutal regime – saw a golden opportunity for the former dictator to be investigated, after Chile had systematically refused to do so. 
Armed with the International Convention against Torture – a ground-breaking treaty under which governments had agreed that those suspected of committing or ordering torture could be tried by state parties all around the world – lawyers began a fierce battle. 
Never before had the Convention been successfully used to prosecute a former head of state suspected of having ordered or committed torture, and the results were astonishing. 
A Spanish judge issued an international warrant looking to prosecute Pinochet for his responsibility in the systematic murders, torture and enforced disappearances committed under his government. 
It was true poetic justice. 
The thousands of torture testimonies that had emerged from Chile after Pinochet took power by force in 1973 had inspired the creation of the Convention in the first place. A quarter century later, he was the first person to be targeted under the treaty’s principle of universal jurisdiction. 
One of the individuals behind the creation of the ground-breaking treaty was Sir Nigel Rodley, a British lawyer and former Amnesty International legal adviser: 
“The Pinochet case gave many a sense of vindication. It was a triumph for human rights. He was this swaggering dictator who had thought he was invulnerable and then he was detained for a year in another country.” 
Pinochet was eventually allowed to return to Chile a free man in 2000 following the UK’s controversial decision citing the former ruler’s poor health. However, the case proved that the Convention against Torture is a powerful legal tool in the fight for justice. 
1973 was an eventful year for the fight against torture. 
The Pinochet coup in Chile, with its mass arrests followed by detentions in the National Stadium, executions, torture and enforced disappearances, brought home the fact that torture was not an evil of the past but very much alive. 
Partly in response to those horrors, Amnesty International launched the first-ever global campaign to stamp out the brutal practice. 
That same year, the organization published a weighty 225-page report that analysed, for the first time in history, the extent to which beatings, electrocutions, stress positions and other forms of torture were being used by governments around the world to punish dissidents or extract confessions. 
This kick-started an international campaign to persuade authorities to end the brutal practice at home and abroad. 
Activists took to the streets to gather signatures and stood in front of TV cameras to talk about the kinds of abuses many ignored. Meanwhile lawyers gathered to seek out legal avenues to end the suffering of hundreds of thousands. 
At an international conference of lawmakers organized by Amnesty International in Paris, one lawyer suggested that one way to fight against torture was to have a robust, legally binding international treaty to ban it. 
Torture was already illegal in many countries and an international consensus meant that it was globally prohibited and a crime under international law. 
A Convention, however, would ensure that states who ratified it were legally obliged to create a specific crime of torture in their laws, investigate all complaints promptly and impartially, punish perpetrators, prohibit “evidence” obtained by torture in courts, refrain from forcibly sending people to where they risk torture and more. 
Another key obligation would be for states to ensure that those suspected of torture could be tried in any country which has ratified the Convention. 
The timing seemed perfect. 
The United Nations General Assembly had already been discussing the need for a resolution on torture. Several years later, at the end of 1977, the Swedish government took the initiative to propose the development of a convention. 
Intensive negotiations got under way at the UN in New York and in governments across the globe. 
But it proved very difficult to find agreement on clauses that would oblige governments to investigate and prosecute those responsible for carrying out or ordering torture, even abroad. 
“Many countries really resisted this aspect. The French didn’t like it at first, the Dutch, who were chairing the working group, didn’t like it at first, quite a lot of others didn’t like it but slowly different countries came around and bought into the idea. The basic idea was that there should be no safe haven for torturers,” Sir Nigel explains. 
After long discussions, on 10 December 1984, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Comprised of 33 articles, it defines what torture is and how it should be criminalized, investigated and prosecuted. It sets out clear legal obligations for countries to take action against torture at home and abroad. 
While Pinochet ultimately evaded justice, dozens of others have been prosecuted under the premise of universal jurisdiction enshrined in the Convention against Torture. 
Sir Rodley believes that the document now serves as a powerful deterrent. 
“The Convention means that there is a new avenue for justice; that world leaders responsible for torture think twice before travelling to a country where they might be arrested. It brought a certain degree of uncertainty and fear for high political leaders and it might have inhibited certain amount of torture and that is a very good thing,” he explains. 
Sir Rodley now says that even though there is still a lot of work to be done to stamp out torture, things have changed since the Convention was adopted. 
“Today, it is universally accepted that torture is prohibited under international law. But in the end, it is not the international community who can stop torture, it is only the countries themselves which can stop it. Part of the problem is that most of the torture takes place against common criminals no one cares about, it is committed by incompetent police officers who are underpaid and pressured to keep the streets safe and, as long as they are not brought to justice for it, it will continue to happen.” 
But the success of the Convention is not limited to prosecutions. Over the years, more and more states have criminalized torture, put in place safeguards such as prompt access to lawyers and family following arrest, prohibited incommunicado detention and allowed visits to prisons by independent monitors. 
But the fact that torture is still alive and well in many parts of the world means that much work remains to be done. 
Thirty years on from the Convention’s entry into force, Amnesty International is still leading the battle against torture. Despite persistent challenges, the organization will continue naming and shaming the perpetrators and the countries where the practice is rife, as part of its ongoing efforts to stamp out torture once and for all.

You may have noticed an Amnesty International campaign “Think Winter is Torture,Think Mexico” that reaches out to potential Canadian travellers to Mexico. 
	There’s a compelling reason why Amnesty is reaching out this way and it starts with an alarming human rights situation in Mexico. What has been revealed in the last couple of months in Mexico is a horror story that is simply unacceptable. Yet it’s one that has largely escaped attention in Canada and the condemnation that could help make it stop. 
 
It’s a story illustrated by the tortured, disfigured body of a young teacher-training student found in September after police attacked the bus on which he and his classmates were travelling, taking dozens of them away. Protests spread across the country when Mexicans learned of the killing of three students and “disappearance” of 43 more. It was one atrocity too many, for a country that has descended into a nightmare. 
 
Official sources confirm there have been more than 7,000 reports of torture and ill-treatment by police or members of the armed forces in Mexico in the last four years alone. But this is likely only the tip of the iceberg, with other victims too fearful to make a complaint. Torture is quite simply out of control, as our latest report carefully documents. So much so that a staggering 64 percent of Mexican citizens are afraid they would be tortured if detained by the authorities, according to a survey commissioned by Amnesty International.	  
Mexico has legislation that makes torture a crime. Yet the use of torture has increased 600 percent over the past decade, since the deployment of the army and marines in the so-called war on drugs. 
The sad truth is that barbaric practices are thriving as authorities turn a blind eye or downplay the severity of the abuse. Tolerance, complicity, impunity, silence: it’s a lethal combination. That’s why men, women and young people in Mexico, whose only crime may have been to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, have been subjected to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment by those who should be protecting them. The impact is lasting trauma and a crisis of distrust in all state officials. 
But Mexico is part of the international community, and a close partner of Canada, tied by trade, investment and the thousands of tourists who make their way to Mexico each year. For these reasons and others, Mexico is extremely mindful of its international reputation and the concerns of citizens in other countries. 
  
It is with this in mind that Amnesty International Canada has launched a provocative ad campaign that reaches out to Canadians considering travel to Mexico. “Think winter is torture? Think Mexico!” reads the ad, which leads to the Last Chance Travel Club. At first look, it seems to offer what many of us are seeking at this time of the year – a holiday in beautiful, vibrant Mexico. But the site actually showcases the plight of torture victims in Mexico and invites travellers to send a message to Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto to address the crisis. 
It is time to end the silence. It is time to face the facts and raise our voices in solidarity with torture survivors in Mexico who have courageously come forward to tell the truth, to seek justice and try to ensure that no one else suffers as they have. It is time to support equally courageous Mexican human rights defenders who are seeking to hold state security forces and government authorities accountable; to stop crimes against humanity. 
Are we discouraging Canadians from travelling to Mexico? Not at all! The Mexico I know is a country renowned for its spectacular beauty, inspiring history, countless achievements and its warm, wonderful peoples. The question is: are we willing to speak up for that Mexico, for the human rights of those peoples, and demand an end to the inhuman abuses that are staining the country with blood? 
Who better to speak up than those travelling to Mexico? 
Mexican authorities care what Canadians think. The lastchancetravelclub initiative gives Canadian vacationers, business travellers and indeed all of us an opportunity to speak up for human rights before we visit Mexico.

, 					Amnesty’s report on the widespread use of torture and other ill-treatment by military and police forces across Mexico 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
Official sources confirm there have been more than 7,000 reports of torture and ill-treatment by police or members of the armed forces in Mexico in the last four years alone. But this is likely only the tip of the iceberg, with other victims too fearful to make a complaint. Torture is quite simply out of control, as our latest report carefully documents. So much so that a staggering 64 percent of Mexican citizens are afraid they would be tortured if detained by the authorities, according to a survey commissioned by Amnesty International. 
, 	  
,  
,  
Mexico has legislation that makes torture a crime. Yet the use of torture has increased 600 percent over the past decade, since the deployment of the army and marines in the so-called war on drugs. 
,  
The sad truth is that barbaric practices are thriving as authorities turn a blind eye or downplay the severity of the abuse. Tolerance, complicity, impunity, silence: it’s a lethal combination. That’s why men, women and young people in Mexico, whose only crime may have been to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, have been subjected to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment by those who should be protecting them. The impact is lasting trauma and a crisis of distrust in all state officials. 
,  
But Mexico is part of the international community, and a close partner of Canada, tied by trade, investment and the thousands of tourists who make their way to Mexico each year. For these reasons and others, Mexico is extremely mindful of its international reputation and the concerns of citizens in other countries. 
,  
  
,  
,  
It is with this in mind that Amnesty International Canada has launched a provocative ad campaign that reaches out to Canadians considering travel to Mexico. “Think winter is torture? Think Mexico!” reads the ad, which leads to the Last Chance Travel Club. At first look, it seems to offer what many of us are seeking at this time of the year – a holiday in beautiful, vibrant Mexico. But the site actually showcases the plight of torture victims in Mexico and invites travellers to send a message to Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto to address the crisis.

,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
It is time to end the silence. It is time to face the facts and raise our voices in solidarity with torture survivors in Mexico who have courageously come forward to tell the truth, to seek justice and try to ensure that no one else suffers as they have. It is time to support equally courageous Mexican human rights defenders who are seeking to hold state security forces and government authorities accountable; to stop crimes against humanity. 
,  
Are we discouraging Canadians from travelling to Mexico? Not at all! The Mexico I know is a country renowned for its spectacular beauty, inspiring history, countless achievements and its warm, wonderful peoples. The question is: are we willing to speak up for that Mexico, for the human rights of those peoples, and demand an end to the inhuman abuses that are staining the country with blood? 
,  
Who better to speak up than those travelling to Mexico? 
,  
Mexican authorities care what Canadians think. The lastchancetravelclub initiative gives Canadian vacationers, business travellers and indeed all of us an opportunity to speak up for human rights before we visit Mexico. 
,  
, 	PLEASE HELP US RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHT IN MEXICO BY SHARING THIS CAMPAIGN!

The Ebola epidemic is spreading rapidly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and threatens to spread further. Over 13,000 cases have been reported in eight countries this year, and almost 5,000 people have died. Current projections suggest there could be 10,000 cases—and 5,000 deaths—per week by December. 
Health systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were already weak from years of armed conflict. They suffer from shortages in funding, staff, a lack of health care workers, and poor infrastructure. And now they are collapsing under the strain of responding to the Ebola virus. Without financial support and increased humanitarian and medical staff, the epidemic will continue to expand and many more lives will be lost. 
 
So what does this have to do with human rights? 
We all have the right to access the services and care needed to live a healthy life. Many people in Ebola-affected countries are not able to access any form of medical care right now because of the Ebola epidemic. In some places, restrictions on movement have been put in place to try and contain the virus—but, for example, they also prevent women from accessing pre-natal care and childbirth services. There are cases where hospitals have been closed, with pregnant women unable to deliver in appropriate facilities and leading to infant deaths. Because all available resources are being used to deal with the Ebola crisis, people with cancer, traumatic injuries, and other infectious diseases, for example, may find that there are no healthcare resources available to treat them. 
We all have the right to freedom of movement. Quarantines, which restrict freedom of movement, may be justified under international law only if they are proportionate, time bound, undertaken for legitimate aims, strictly necessary, voluntary wherever possible, and applied in a non-discriminatory way. However, there have been reports of people in quarantine being left in dire situations, unable to access food or clean water and forced to share highly inadequate sanitary facilities. This leaves vulnerable populations open to multiple other types of infections and health issues endemic to the area, beyond the Ebola virus. 
We all have a right to equality and to live free from discrimination. But because of their traditional roles in society and lack of access to information about how to protect themselves, women are disproportionately at risk of contracting Ebola. According to UNICEF, over half of the people dying from Ebola are women; in Liberia, reports attributed to the government claim that 55-75% of those dying are women. In many affected areas, women and girls shoulder the burden of caring for sick relatives and washing bodies for traditional burials. Most medical staff are women. Women are particularly vulnerable during pregnancy because they need to visit health facilities with great frequency, and thus are more likely to come into contact with infected persons. And women may not have access to information about how to protect themselves from Ebola. For example, the virus continues to be secreted in semen for several weeks after recovery; women may not know that condom use can help to prevent them from contracting Ebola, or they may not be in a position to negotiate condom use. 
Governments in a position to do so have an obligation under international human rights law to provide international cooperation and assistance to those states which require it. The international response to the Ebola epidemic has been slow and inadequate. States must now step up their response and provide funding in additional to addressing the dire need for qualified medical and humanitarian staff to be deployed to affected countries. 
What is Amnesty International doing? 
Through our regional office in Dakar, Senegal, we are monitoring and reporting on the response to the Ebola epidemic from a human rights perspective. We have expressed concern about the inadequacy of the international response, which in some cases has left medical staff to work without vital protective equipment or basic facilities to treat patients. We are concerned at the conditions under which some people have been quarantined without access to food or clean water. And we believe that the impacts of the Ebola crisis on women and girls need to be assessed and responded to.

Since the first cases of Ebola were reported in March, life in Sierra Leone has changed beyond recognition. 
So far, the World Health Organization has confirmed more than 5,200 Ebola cases in Sierra Leone alone and more than 13,700 across the world. More than 4,500 people have died of the disease – 1,500 in my home country. 
Friends abroad often ask me what life is like here at the moment. 
I can only describe it as horrifying. 
Every morning, I wake up in my house in Freetown with the sound of the terrifying pictures and stories coming out of the TV and the radio. People are desperately trying, and in many cases failing, to get medical help that would make the difference between life and death. Doctors and nurses are at breaking point. Entire communities are quarantined, lacking access to sufficient food and water. 
 
Before the outbreak, I used to go to my office in the centre of Freetown every day and my children would go to school. 
Now we barely leave the house. We don’t visit anybody and no one visits us. The phone and social media are our main means of communicating with others. My children’s school is closed so they are inside all day. 
Nowadays, the streets of Freetown are not as crowded as before the outbreak. Even though some people seem to continue with their lives as normal, the general feeling is of fear. People are scared of being in contact with someone who might be ill, so more often than not they stay at home. 
Survival is becoming a real challenge even for those not carrying the disease. Even buying food is hard. Many shops are closed and prices have rocketed. We are barely managing. Food is not coming from abroad and many airlines have cancelled flights to the country. 
It feels like the whole country is in quarantine. 
But the situation in the countryside is even worse. 
The government is doing all it can under the circumstances. They have been issuing information on what to do and not to do to avoid catching the illness. But the Ebola outbreak exposed the massive problems with our health system, which is now being challenged beyond breaking point, particularly in rural areas. 
Hospitals are struggling to provide care with little resources and scarce medical personnel. This means that people in need of medical help for illnesses other than Ebola are being turned away, even when they have potentially life threatening conditions such as malaria or complications during child birth. Essential care for cancer seems to have been put on hold. 
Another big issue is the reintegration of Ebola survivors back to their communities. We have heard many stories of people who survive the disease but are not allowed back or are stigmatized. 
While some international operations, for example from the UK, are doing a lot of work to help those in need, the situation remains desperate. 
Even based on the World Health Organization’s most conservative estimates for the spread of the disease, a lot more support than that pledged by the world to date needs to be put into place if Ebola is to be controlled. 
We desperately need the international community to step up their efforts, and not only the provision of financial assistance. What people in Sierra Leone really need are doctors and nurses ready to work and bring their expertize to fight this cruel illness. This can only been done with a concerted international effort and global political resolve. 
This is a global crisis which demands a global response. 
Too many lives are at stake. There’s no time to waste.

Nearly three months have passed since the latest conflict came to an end, but the piles of rubble and empty shells of family homes in Gaza serve as painful reminders of the death and destruction that resulted from Israel’s latest military operation there in July and August this year. 
Mohammad Akram al-Hallaq’s three grandchildren were watching cartoons in the television room when the three missiles struck on 20 July. The walls collapsed in an avalanche of rubble, crumbling into piles of dust and rocks above and below them. None of the children survived. Eight people, all civilians, including four children from another family living in the building were also killed. 
Across Gaza, similar scenes were repeated. At least 18,000 homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair and more than 1,500 Palestinian civilians were killed during Operation Protective Edge. In Israel, at least six civilians, including one child, were killed as Palestinian armed groups fired indiscriminate rockets across the border.In our report published today, Amnesty International discloses the details of a series of Israeli attacks carried out in Gaza on Palestinian family homes. Many of the homes attacked were crammed full of people who had had sought safety with relatives after fleeing other war-ravaged areas of Gaza. 
With this evidence we can now say with certainty that Israeli forces displayed an appalling disregard for civilian life, levelling entire buildings housing dozens of residents in several grossly disproportionate attacks carried out without warning. The evidence clearly points to the fact that some of these unlawful attacks are war crimes. 
In total, at least 104 civilians, including 62 children, were killed in unjustified attacks on eight different homes. Such deaths could have and should have been prevented. Civilians were given no warning and had no chance to flee. Under the laws of war (international humanitarian law) deliberately attacking civilians is strictly prohibited. And all feasible precautions, including warning civilians, must be taken to minimize the risk to civilians. 
Attacks which are anticipated to cause large numbers of civilian casualties are likely to be disproportionate and should be cancelled. Yet in several cases these fundamental obligations were ignored. 
Israeli officials have failed to answer the difficult questions raised by these attacks. In fact they have not even acknowledged that they were responsible. Israel has the technical capability to carry out precise strikes on specific targets causing far less devastation – why did its forces repeatedly choose to level entire buildings full of civilians instead? What were the intended targets? Why didn’t they issue effective warnings? 
These were not isolated incidents, but part of a pattern of attacks on inhabited homes carried out throughout the operation, displaying an indifference to the suffering of Palestinian civilians and disregard to its obligations under international humanitarian law. 
In this decades-old conflict, both sides have shown scant regard for civilians. Palestinian armed groups have fired indiscriminate rockets into Israel, stored weapons in schools, and launched rockets near civilian homes. So far there is no indication that violations by either side have brought their people safety or security. 
This year’s war was the third major conflict in Gaza since 2008. The world has grown too accustomed to images of bodies of Gazans being pulled from beneath the rubble and of Israeli civilians running for bomb shelters. 
It seems the wounds barely have time to heal before a fresh round of fighting breaks out. 
But neither the Palestinian authorities nor Israel have conducted independent, impartial investigations into allegations of war crimes during past hostilities. 
To put an end to this ever worsening devastation and destruction, the cycle of impunity must be stopped. Serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law must be independently and impartially investigated and those responsible for crimes must be brought to justice. 
Israel must lift the siege of Gaza and ensure that it never again relies on tactics that violate the fundamentals of international humanitarian law. And Hamas and Palestinian armed groups for their part must end indiscriminate attacks and deliberate attacks on civilians. 
At present, the prospects for justice look slim. Israel has announced a series of inquiries that do not meet international standards and have no prospect of ensuring justice and reparation for victims. Neither Hamas or the Palestinian authorities are likely to do any better. Israel has pointedly refused to cooperate with the UN Commission of Inquiry to investigate alleged human rights abuses in the latest conflict and it has continued to deny access to Gaza for Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is crucial to bringing those responsible for crimes under international law in current and previous Israeli-Palestinian conflicts to justice. The Israeli and Palestinian authorities and the international community alike must take all measures to give the ICC Prosecutor authority to do what national authorities have failed to do: independently and impartially investigate crimes by all parties. 
The international community must not be allowed to fail the victims of violations once more. Those who order or commit war crimes must be brought to justice or civilians are likely to pay an even higher price in the next round of fighting.

The fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the start of seismic changes that continue to shake Ukraine. Two years later, the Soviet Union, of which Ukraine was a part, collapsed. At the time I was 10 years old and my growing up coincided with my country’s steps towards independence and the rule of law. 
The 90s were a difficult time for independent Ukraine. Coming out from the totalitarian embrace of the Soviet Union, the country was plunged into economic and social chaos. I remember the empty shelves in the shops, the coupons which we had to cut out – a substitute for real money – with which we could buy sugar, washing powder and vodka. Several generations brought up in Communist times were trying to find their way in the new market economy. In Ukraine’s case, instead of the rule of law, the country woke up to the rule of racketeering and lawlessness. 
The circumstances were not the best for the emerging civil society. On the other hand, the collapse of the Soviet Union heralded freedom and the possibility to enjoy civil and political rights – the dream of many dissidents. One of those who were persecuted under the Soviet regime was Amnesty International’s prisoner of conscience Miroslav Mironovych. He was so impressed with the support he received from Amnesty International’s members while in prison, so taken by the idea of international solidarity that he decided to set up a chapter in Ukraine. This became possible in 1991. 
Since then Amnesty International Ukraine has campaigned tirelessly on the death penalty and other human rights issues. However, where positive changes were happening, these were often more to do with foreign policy – Ukraine’s declared “pro-European” choice – than with popular mobilisation. 
Amnesty International could not generate significant support for its cause. Most Ukrainians were too caught up in the daily struggle of living in poverty to turn their attention to human rights issues. 
But this was soon to change. In 2000, the murder of prominent investigative journalist Georgiy Gonzadze shocked the country. The allegations that the then President Leonid Kuchma had possibly ordered the murder triggered mass protests under the slogan “Ukraine without Kuchma” which ultimately led to the Orange Revolution in 2004. 
I took part in that Revolution. I was thrilled by the sight of all those people who braved the snow, the cold, the possibility of police and even army brutality. I was elated by the prevailing atmosphere of tolerance and mutual respect and support. 
Most of all I was struck by the way the media liberated itself from censorship and self-censorship. Journalists were turning their backs to state propaganda. Looking back, I think that freedom of expression was the main achievement of the Revolution. 
However, subsequent governments failed to implement deep structural reforms. 
Corruption continued to engulf Ukraine. Human rights were violated with impunity. Torture and other ill-treatment by police were and are rampant in places of detention – issues on which Amnesty International Ukraine has worked on with some success. 
The organization was slowly but steadily growing and forming partnerships with other human rights groups in the country, fighting discrimination against refugees and against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. 
There was hope that the Association Agreement with the European Union, scheduled for November 2013, would lead to long-needed reforms. But at the last moment, the Ukrainian authorities backed down, which provoked the peaceful protest — initially of students and young professionals and later joined by people from all walks of life — at the central Kyiv square the Maydan. 
The EuroMaydan, as the protest became widely known, continued throughout the winter. At times it turned violent – protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the police. The response was swift and harsh: on 22 January snipers shot two protesters, and dozens more people were killed in the days that followed. 
Amnesty International was at the forefront of calls for independent and impartial investigations into the abuses. “Human rights above everything” was one of the slogans of the protest. 
While the hope was that EuroMaydan would change Ukrainian society once and for all, the wish for a happy ending has had a bitter twist. The ousting of then President Viktor Yanukovych was just the beginning of one of the most turbulent periods in Ukraine’s history. Russia occupied and, in March 2014, annexed Crimea. Pro-Russian separatism arose in the east of the country, and an armed conflict began which has already taken over 4,000 lives. 
Now freedom of expression is again under threat, this time falling victim to the information war with Russia and pro-Russian activists in eastern Ukraine. Both sides trade allegations against the other of extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. 
Both sides of the conflict have tried to impose their version of events and to silence any media that could offer an alternative point of view. There are cases of journalists beaten and abducted. Some have been killed, others disappeared without a trace. 
In March, Oleksandr Panteleymonov, head of the First National TV Channel, was visited in his offices by Igor Miroshnichenko from the Svoboda (Freedom) Party and at least five thugs who beat him and forced him to write a resignation letter. 
Pro-Kyiv media tends to present facts selectively, usually omitting any information presenting pro-Kyiv forces in a critical light. 
However, there is no media blackout as such. There are media outlets that carry different points of view. As a representative of Amnesty International Ukraine I am a frequent guest in TV and radio studios speaking about human rights violations perpetrated by pro-Kyiv forces. 
The platforms for informed debate are shrinking rapidly, and even on social media, polarised viewpoints clash with surprising ferocity. Freedom of expression is not respected for what it is — the right to hold and express opinions without interference in a debate where the arguments of the opponent can be taken into account. 
Twenty five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 10 years after the Orange Revolution, Ukraine is again at a crossroads, being torn between its past and the future. 
A new pro-European parliament was elected at the end of October, but many of the questions are still pending: 
Will the new Ukrainian authorities promote human rights and the rule of law? 
Will they enter in dialogue with civil society? 
Will Ukrainians be ready to continue the fight for human rights for all? 
I am afraid, for the immediate future, that the answer to some of these questions is “No”. Amnesty International is still heavily criticized when we speak out against human rights violations perpetrated by pro-Kyiv forces in eastern Ukraine. The authorities are, yet again, unwilling to act on our recommendations. 
Our hope is that all is not lost. Now, unlike 25 years ago, civil society is thriving and social media is still a powerful force for change. We will continue to wave the flag of human rights in a bid to ensure that all the people of Ukraine enjoy the freedoms they deserve.

Five months to the day after being abducted and held hostage by the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), a group of 25 students from Kobani were unexpectedly set free on 29 October. 
They were the last remaining captives from a group of around 150 schoolchildren from the embattled Kurdish-majority city in northern Syria who were returning from their final year examinations in Aleppo in May when IS members stopped their school bus at a checkpoint and abducted them all. In the months that followed, they were sporadically released. Those we spoke to had horror stories to tell about life in IS captivity. 
In Suruç, a town in Turkey merely 10km from Kobani, refugees from the besieged city told me how the students’ harrowing experience was typical of the many abductions by IS in the year and a half since the armed group besieged their city. 
One of the released students, a 15-year-old boy who chose to remain unnamed, described the four months he spent in the hands of IS, detailing the armed group’s use of torture against students who broke the rigid rules, or attempted to escape. 
As well as being compelled to attend daily “religious lessons”, the students were expected to follow a strict list of rules that included sleeping by 10pm, remaining in their rooms at all times except at prayer time, and being quiet. Those found breaking the rules were punished, often with beatings. 
“The school in Manbej where we were held had two floors; we were kept on the upper floor and the fighters slept on the bottom floor. We were all frightened of the bottom floor; there was a room there that they called the ‘torture room’. That is where they took down students who misbehaved and beat them; it’s also the room that had all the torture equipment, like the electricity, the hosepipes and the ropes. 
“Those of us who were caught trying to escape were beaten upstairs, in front of the other students. I think this was a warning to the other students, but I don’t think it worked. We all believed we were never going to be released, so while it was terrifying to watch the beatings, it only took a few days to get over the fear and for a few of the boys to try to escape again. 
“I tried to escape, and was caught with three other boys. They hung me from the ceiling from my wrists for around half an hour. 
“Then they beat us in front of everyone; there were three of them beating the three of us. They used their hands, legs and hosepipes. I was then taken downstairs and given electric shocks. They attached tongs to my fingers and turned the electricity on five times.” 
The use of electricity, and the practice of being hung from the ceiling by the wrists, often referred to as shabah, have both been documented extensively in prisons and detention centres in Syria and are believed to be commonly practised by members of Bashar al-Assad’s security and intelligence services. 
According to the released student, he witnessed a friend being taken to an IS-run hospital after a beating. The boy reportedly sustained a number of serious head injuries before collapsing. 
“He looked dizzy and he suddenly fell to the ground. He was taken straight away by the fighters to a hospital and was returned three days later, but he was not normal. He barely moved for around 20 days after that; he only spoke. He began to move slowly just before he was released. 
“I wish no one ever falls into these people’s hands. Some of the students used to faint from fear after watching the beatings they carried out to punish those of us who misbehaved or tried to run away, so you can imagine how brutal they were. I wish no one has to go through that again.” 
His quivering voice was a reminder that this 15-year-old boy, like the scores of other abducted students, was just a child. 
For those whose relatives remain in IS custody, these stories, as well as the group’s own propaganda videos, work only to heighten alarm and fear as they await news of their loved ones’ fates. 
Only several days before the last group of students were released, “Omar”, the father of one of the boys who was still in captivity, told me about the uncertainty and fear that he and his wife were living with: 
“We are afraid to raise the alarm, we are afraid to highlight our son’s captivity in the media. No one knows how this group functions, or how they might react. They are completely unpredictable.” 
Indeed, just a few days later, Omar’s son was released along with the remaining students. 
Following his son’s release I called Omar to congratulate him. He said he did not know why his son was held for so long, or why he was released, only that the experience had left its mark on their family: 
“When you have a child it is human instinct to do everything you can to protect them. That is how I felt; I was prepared to do everything to get my son back, but was unable to do anything. That was so very painful. 
“I am a strong person, but even I couldn’t keep it together when I saw him again. His mother would not let him go, she held on to him and cried for 15 minutes.”

A dust cloud from the US air strike drifts across the border from Kobani and blurs our view from the overlooking Turkish hilltop. Most if not all of those watching – all Kurds, it seems, from both Syria and Turkey – agree that the damage caused to the city by air strikes is a price worth paying. Many believe the city’s defence, led by Syrian Kurdish fighters, would have collapsed without them. 
“My home may get destroyed but if it forces out Da’esh”, as the armed group which calls itself the Islamic State (IS) is usually referred to locally, “then I am happy,” says one. 
Fighters from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) lead the city’s defence against the armed group widely loathed by Kurds.   
Residents of the scores of villages outside Kobani, and then the city itself, fled ahead of the rapid IS advance, well aware of the atrocities committed by the group against Iraqi Kurds in Sinjar and elsewhere. Some 200,000 fled into Turkey, two-thirds of them in just four days in September this year. 
A tiny number of civilians stayed behind in the villages, some physically unable – and others unwilling – to leave. Contact with them has been lost. We are given the names of some believed to have been killed, while others say their relatives or friends were taken captive by IS. 
When we visit one of the newly established refugee camps near the town of Suruç, in Turkey, a Syrian Kurdish woman says her father-in-law and his son have chosen to stay on in Tel Hajeb village “because it is their home”. For a month there has been no news of them. 
On the hilltop, a tall young man says that the previous day he went to observe his village Zorava, 8km west of Kobani, from a safe distance on the Turkish side of the border. In the village, from which he and the rest of the population had fled, he could make out armed men he presumed to be IS fighters washing clothes and hanging them out to dry.   
Around 2,000 people have found themselves stranded in no man’s land between Syria and Turkey. We meet a dozen men stuck in a 25-metre by 100-metre strip between the border fences east of Kobani (between the village of Alanyurt in Turkey and the Syrian village of Kikan), not visible from the hilltop. 
“There are 200 of us here. We have the clothes we are wearing, our vehicles, which we sleep in, and our sheep, which are dying,” says one older man. 
All say that they were forced to leave their vehicles behind at the border. When we check this with one of Turkey’s border guards nearby, he shrugs. “These are our orders,” he says. 
Looking a little to the north-west of Kobani, on the Turkish side, hundreds of vehicles glint in the afternoon sun. These have been impounded by the Turkish authorities and dozens of their owners and other drivers mill about, keeping an eye on them through a security fence. Several ask us to tell the Turkish authorities to release their vehicles. 
“Let us register them, take them or sell them and leave this place. We feel like prisoners here,” says one. 
The largest group stuck in no man’s land are behind the vehicle compound. Up to 2,000 displaced Syrians are surviving there in desperate conditions. 
We pass through two Turkish army checkpoints to reach them but not the third and final one. While waiting for the green light that didn’t come, we speak with several Syrians who have been allowed out to get food and medicine. 
“I went to get oranges and bread to bring to my family,” says a small, tired man with two plastic bags of food. “But the soldiers have kept me waiting here for five hours.” 
Another tells us: “There’s no water, no bread, no doctors. We sleep in or under the cars and hide behind them when the fighting or shelling sounds close.” 
A third says he was beaten up with two other men by Turkish police who accused them of being YPG members, which he denies. We recognize several men wearing Syrian Red Crescent uniforms who tell us they have just completed their daily distribution of 1,000 loaves of bread and some flour to those in no man’s land. 
“A big fear are the landmines. Four people have been killed here and 17 have been injured,” they inform us. 
Back on the hilltop, men – and it is only men here – comment on the sights and sounds of the fighting in front of us. “Kalashnikov”, “Doshka” – a heavy machine-gun, “mortar from Da’esh on YPG positions”, “street-fighting”, “Da’esh burning buildings to hide under the smoke”. At times they point upwards at glimmers of circling US aircraft. 
As the sun once more drops to the horizon, we move away northwards from the hilltop as clashes continue in the city and hundreds of civilians prepare for another harsh night in no man’s land.

In the village, from which he and the rest of the population had fled, he could make out armed men he presumed to be IS fighters washing clothes and hanging them out to dry.   
,  
Around 2,000 people have found themselves stranded in no man’s land between Syria and Turkey. We meet a dozen men stuck in a 25-metre by 100-metre strip between the border fences east of Kobani (between the village of Alanyurt in Turkey and the Syrian village of Kikan), not visible from the hilltop. 
,  
“There are 200 of us here. We have the clothes we are wearing, our vehicles, which we sleep in, and our sheep, which are dying,” says one older man. 
,  
All say that they were forced to leave their vehicles behind at the border. When we check this with one of Turkey’s border guards nearby, he shrugs. “These are our orders,” he says. 
,  
Looking a little to the north-west of Kobani, on the Turkish side, hundreds of vehicles glint in the afternoon sun. These have been impounded by the Turkish authorities and dozens of their owners and other drivers mill about, keeping an eye on them through a security fence. Several ask us to tell the Turkish authorities to release their vehicles. 
,  
“Let us register them, take them or sell them and leave this place. We feel like prisoners here,” says one. 
,  
The largest group stuck in no man’s land are behind the vehicle compound. Up to 2,000 displaced Syrians are surviving there in desperate conditions. 
,  
We pass through two Turkish army checkpoints to reach them but not the third and final one. While waiting for the green light that didn’t come, we speak with several Syrians who have been allowed out to get food and medicine. 
,  
“I went to get oranges and bread to bring to my family,” says a small, tired man with two plastic bags of food. “But the soldiers have kept me waiting here for five hours.” 
,  
Another tells us: “There’s no water, no bread, no doctors. We sleep in or under the cars and hide behind them when the fighting or shelling sounds close.” 
,  
A third says he was beaten up with two other men by Turkish police who accused them of being YPG members, which he denies. We recognize several men wearing Syrian Red Crescent uniforms who tell us they have just completed their daily distribution of 1,000 loaves of bread and some flour to those in no man’s land. 
,  
“A big fear are the landmines. Four people have been killed here and 17 have been injured,” they inform us. 
,  
Back on the hilltop, men – and it is only men here – comment on the sights and sounds of the fighting in front of us. “Kalashnikov”, “Doshka” – a heavy machine-gun, “mortar from Da’esh on YPG positions”, “street-fighting”, “Da’esh burning buildings to hide under the smoke”. At times they point upwards at glimmers of circling US aircraft. 
,  
As the sun once more drops to the horizon, we move away northwards from the hilltop as clashes continue in the city and hundreds of civilians prepare for another harsh night in no man’s land.

Unlike in nearby villages recently captured by the Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), not a single villager has returned to Barzanke. 
As I go from house to house, it becomes clear why. There is nothing for the residents to return to; virtually all the houses have been destroyed or damaged beyond repair. 
Some were seemingly bombed from the air by US forces, others may have been struck by the Peshmerga as they tried to dislodge the IS fighters who had seized the area last August, but most were evidently blown up from inside. 
Some Peshmerga had previously told me and another human rights investigator that it was their own colleagues who had blown up the houses because the villagers supported IS. 
The Peshmerga, now stationed in the village offer conflicting explanations for the mass destruction. Some tell me that IS fighters blew up all the houses before they left, which does not tally with their colleagues’ narrative, nor with the situation in the area. Retreating IS fighters did not destroy nearby majority Kurdish villages, so why would they destroy an Arab village? 
Others say they had to blow up the houses because they were booby-trapped and tell me not to go into the village because there are booby traps in the streets. Clearly that is not the case; one of their colleagues is walking around taking photos of the wrecks and two large dogs – the village’s only remaining residents – are roaming the areas without setting off any explosives. I spend a couple of hours going from house to house without incident. 
Yet another tells me the destruction was the result of fighting but, as I point out, there is no sign of battles in the village – no pockmarked walls or spent munitions or cartridges. One fighter says they collected them so the returning residents won’t have to see them, but even his own colleagues look puzzled by the explanation. Soldiers in an acute conflict situation do not usually waste time collecting harmless and useless spent munition cartridges, all the more so in a place they claim is rigged with explosives. 
They give up trying to explain the wholesale destruction and shift to justifying it: The residents, Arab Sunni Muslims, were terrorists even before the Islamic State armed group had captured the village. They have gone with IS and will not come back, they say. 
There have also been allegations that when they took control of Barzanke, Peshmerga soldiers summarily executed several captured ISIS fighters. A Peshmerga who last week boasted about the unlawful killings to foreign journalists, not realizing that he was being filmed, later retracted his statement and no other evidence has emerged so far as there were no witnesses to the Peshmerga’s capture of the village. 
In nearby villages also recently recaptured by Peshmerga forces, only the Kurdish residents have returned – and they are determined to keep it that way. 
The rhetoric is the same everywhere: “The Arabs were with Da’esh (the name locals use to refer to IS). They cannot come back”. 
In Zummar a polite, soft-spoken Kurdish young man tells me: “We’ll blow up the Arabs’ houses so they won’t come back. For the Arabs here, it’s over”. I am struck by the contrast between his gentle demeanour and the enormity of what he says. 
On the shutters of several shops along the main road on the edge of the town the word “Kurdi” (Kurdish) is freshly written. Why? I asked a small group of men in civilian clothes standing by some of these shops. 
“So people know who they belong to and nobody interferes with them,” they reply. 
“And the other shops and properties,” I ask, “the ones belonging to the Arab residents who are seemingly not going to be allowed to return?” 
The men shrug and do not respond. 
On the way back, about 100 km from the town of Zummar, I get talking to an older Peshmerga who tells me he only recently completed law school because he spent his youth as a fighter against Iraq’s former dictator, Saddam Hussein. When I tell him that I’m troubled by the destruction I saw in Barzanke, he comments: “well those were Kurdish villages where Saddam Hussein settled the Arabs; and now the Kurds are taking some back”. 
For now the Peshmerga have only captured relatively small areas from IS, but if and when they retake more territory, there is a real danger that revenge attacks against Sunni Arab civilians and their homes and businesses may increase – further worsening the sectarian conflict in Iraq. 
The KRG must act now to stamp out any such practices, including by investigating all reports of such abuses – some of which may constitute war crimes – and ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice. 
It is also incumbent on the US, European and other governments who are currently providing weapons, training and advice to the Peshmerga to put in place the necessary oversight mechanisms to ensure the conduct of the Peshmerga complies with international humanitarian law (the laws of war).

Events being reported in the Canadian media have launched a national conversation about violence against women. It is a difficult but important conversation about why so many people—mainly but not exclusively women—continue to experience violence, and in particular sexual violence, and very often feel unwilling or unable to report it; as well as why we as a society have failed to stop it. 
In talking about allegations of sexual violence and harassment we are talking about some of our most fundamental human rights that each and every one of us possesses. 
We are talking about our basic human right to live free from rape and other violence.  We are talking about the right to equality. Despite having these rights enshrined in international human rights law and in our own domestic laws, at least one third of women globally experience violence at some point in their lives. This statistic applies whether you live in Canada or Morocco. And women in other countries, as in Canada, are unlikely to report acts of violence or harassment to the authorities. 
In Morocco, 16-year-old Amina was raped. Her family reported the rape to authorities and were advised that she should marry her rapist to preserve her family’s honour (until January 2014 rapists in Morocco could escape jail time by marrying their victims). To escape the horror of being forced to marry her rapist, Amina killed herself by swallowing rat poison. 
In Canada, Indigenous women are three times more likely than non-Indigenous women to experience violence. But this violence is underreported for a variety of reasons, including a fear that children will be taken away if violence is occurring in the home, and because of a very real fear that no one will believe them. 
Women in Canada, and around the world, run through a mental checklist of why and why not to report violence. Will anyone believe them? Can anything be done if there isn’t bruising or other physical evidence? Do they want to have to tell their story again and again to police, judges, and in some cases the public? Do they want to be known as a victim?  And to be further traumatized by the criminal process? Do they have the time and money to get through lengthy court proceedings? What would be the impacts on their families? What evidence is there to convict the perpetrator? What information could be used against them? Are they prepared to deal with the media and the public blaming them? What peace and closure will they find if the perpetrator isn’t held to account? 
There are broad societal reasons why violence should be reported, including the need to make sure that perpetrators don’t go on abusing other people. But each victim has to make a difficult and deeply personal decision about what will be best for them, their family, and their friends. 
At the core of this discussion is discrimination, and the fundamental human right to live free from all forms of discrimination. Women, men, and gender non-conforming individuals (who don’t neatly fit into the categories or male and female) all experience violence. But people of different genders experience violence in very different ways and for very different reasons. 
According to Statistics Canada, overall, women face slightly higher rates of violence than men, but women face much higher rates of sexual violence than men. All too often this violence is specifically because they are women, or because they are gender non-conforming. This violence is compounded by discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity, sexual identity, social status, class, and age. Such multiple forms of discrimination further restrict women’s choices, increase their vulnerability to violence, and make it even harder for women to obtain justice. Violence against women feeds off discrimination and serves to reinforce it. 
We have come a long way in the fight for gender equality. Women can vote, hold property and political office, and make up the majority of university students. But women still earn 20% less than male counterparts for the same work, do 50% more household work, and are more likely to be poor. Women only make up 9% of the police, 27% of the judges, and 27% of the parliamentarians worldwide. 
To be equal, women need to live free from discrimination, and free from violence. Women need to be comfortable around men without fear of being attacked, and if women experience violence or harassment, they need to be comfortable coming forward. Women who come forward need to have confidence that perpetrators will be held to account in a process that recognizes the rights of victims and avoids re-victimization as much as possible. 
One in three women has experienced violence. One in three of your female Facebook friends has experienced violence. Perhaps you have experienced violence and gone to the authorities or the media. Perhaps you have decided not to share your story. 
The national discussion about violence includes all of us. We all come to the discussion from a different starting place. But we ultimately need to end at the same place—a place where we firmly reject discrimination and reject violence; a place where the human rights of all people are wholeheartedly respected.

How often do you get the chance to sit down with a hero whose courageous actions make change happen where it is least expected? I got just that opportunity when I travelled to a small town in Mexico (unnamed for security reasons) to meet up with Valentina Rosendo Cantú. 
Like other Me’phaa Indigenous women from beautiful Guerrero State, Valentina is small in stature. But I can tell you that she has the courage of a giant. 
In 2002, Valentina was washing clothes in a stream when an army patrol arrived. They demanded information about people they accused of subversion. Valentina knew nothing about what they were asking. She barely understood the Spanish they spoke. She was just 17 years old. The soldiers proceeded to torture and rape her. 
 
Valentina’s first act of incredible bravery was to report what had been done to her, given the reality that women survivors of sexual torture face stigmatization and questioning of their story that exacerbates the suffering they have already experienced. In Mexico, that pattern is compounded by the power of the military.  
Valentina soon saw her criminal complaint about the soldiers transferred to military investigators and the intimidation began. At one point, her home was surrounded by soldiers. Amidst fear and pressure, Valentina’s community was less than supportive. She had no choice but to leave. 
Faced with such horrendous realities, Valentina’s determination to carry on her quest for justice is truly inspiring.   
With the help of local Indigenous and non-Indigenous organizations, she sought justice outside of Mexico, testifying to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and then to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The response back in Mexico was death threats that forced Valentina to move in search of safety. Throughout those difficult years, Amnesty activists in Canada and around the world provided steadfast support in the form of countless letters of concern to authorities and mountains of messages of support to Valentina – some in the form of maple leaves. 
But this story does not end in fear and impunity.  As Valentina told me with shining eyes: “We have achieved justice – much more than we ever expected at the start!” 
In 2010, the Inter-American Court ruled in favour of Valentina and found Mexico accountable both for the sexual torture she suffered at the hands of soldiers and for failing to provide access to justice. The Mexican government accepted the court’s verdict and promised to implement all its recommendations. Top Mexican government ministers made good on the promise with actions that included a full apology to Valentina in a public ceremony that was organized according to Valentina’s wishes. Equally important, her criminal complaint was transferred from the military to the civilian justice system and two soldiers identified by Valentina are now behind bars awaiting prosecution. 
Valentina is the first to recognize that international support helped to make this possible. “Thank you so much to everyone with Amnesty International who has supported me for so many years,” she says. “We have shared this struggle for justice and together we have achieved these victories.” 
But Valentina also knows that torture is far from being eradicated in Mexico. Since former president Felipe Calderón deployed the army to combat drug cartels, reports of torture by state agents have skyrocketed. Women who are picked up are routinely subjected to sexual violence by security forces who see women’s bodies as the battle ground on which to break their will. 
“It is so important to refuse to be defeated by fear,” Valentina told me, a message she sewed into a handmade, beaded bag she gave me as a thank you to Amnesty International Canada. “We survivors need to find the courage to speak out. But you in Canada can help us. Your letters are so important. They ensure that the government pays attention and feels pressure to act for justice.” 
“Please keep on writing,” said Valentina, her request accompanied by a beautiful smile. “It gives us so much strength and hope here in Mexico to know that you share our quest for human rights and stand with us.”

But you in Canada can help us. Your letters are so important. They ensure that the government pays attention and feels pressure to act for justice.”

“Please keep on writing,” said Valentina, her request accompanied by a beautiful smile. “It gives us so much strength and hope here in Mexico to know that you share our quest for human rights and stand with us.”

I am extremely grateful to have been part of a fantastic team of activists who travelled to Mexico City for Amnistía Internacional México’s Encuentro de Activismo 2014, a conference that brought together Amnesty members from Mexico, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Brazil, USA, and Canada. 
Kathy Price, Amnesty International Canada’s Latin America Campaigner, and I were asked to be part of the closing plenary to share our experiences in Canada mobilizing action for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We were honoured to be on stage with amazing activists like Leonardo González, a leader in the Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous community in Paraguay, Federico Alvarez Robledo of Amnistía Paraguay, Dolores Soto of Amnistía México, and Marselha Gonçalves of Amnesty USA. 
For all of us, it was incredibly inspiring to hear from Leonardo about his community’s recent victory in their long running struggle to regain the lands on which their physical and cultural survival depend.  For over 20 years, the Sawhoyamaxa had been forced to live in temporary housing on the side of a highway because their lands were occupied by private owners. Just this year, the Paraguayan Senate passed a bill to return the land to the Sawhoyamaxa by paying compensation to the current landowners. Federico shared how he and other Amnesty activists in Paraguay worked to assist the Sawhoyamaxa community to get justice, which involved spreading awareness of the situation internationally to put additional pressure on the Paraguayan government. 
As the interventions by Dolores and Marselha highlighted, rights violations facing Indigenous Peoples across the Americas are eerily similar. Indigenous women face exponentially higher rates of violence, including sexual violence. From Canada to South America, Indigenous women are disappearing. This year marks the 10th Anniversary of Amnesty’s Stolen Sisters Report, and the problem still remains. In Canada, within a 30 year period 1,017 Indigenous women and girls have been murdered and 164 remain missing. Mexico is facing a similar crisis—while exact numbers are unknown, it is estimated that at least 3,600 women have disappeared from the city of Ciudad Juárez alone. Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and many other countries in the Americas are also experiencing high rates of femicides.  
Resource development is another issue that affects Indigenous peoples across the Americas. In Canada, Indigenous communities are asserting their right to be properly consulted about proposed resource development (oil and gas, logging, mining) on their land and their right to decision-making about what happens on their lands. The same is happening in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, and beyond. With Canadian mining companies (or subsidiaries of Canadian companies) conducting the majority of this resource extraction, Canada must work to hold corporations responsible for human rights violations overseas. So far, this has not been the case.  
For Amnesty Canada’s contribution to the panel, Kathy and I shared the work that our members have been doing to support the rights of Indigenous peoples both in Colombia and here in Canada. In each case, our activists do not speak for but rather in support of Indigenous peoples and their rights. We take direction from Indigenous organizations and communities, whether in Canada or in Colombia, and call for the action that they are urging. 
In Canada, we have the freedom to work on issues that exist within our own country. As Amnesty members, we also believe we have a responsibility to work on human rights violations in Canada at the same time we are working on those same issues internationally. Kathy talked about the reasons we have chosen to prioritize Colombia – including the severity of the human rights situation there with more than a third of Indigenous peoples currently facing destruction amidst armed conflict, violent displacement and the imposition of resource extraction. She also explained the other imperative; the Canadian connection to this emergency. The Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement promotes Canadian investment in resource development in Colombia without human rights guarantees.We have a responsibility to do better. 
In my talk, I summarized important issues for our work with First Nations in Canada: the crisis around missing and murdered Indigenous women and human rights violations linked to resource development, including the cases of the Lubicon Cree, Grassy Narrows, the currently proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline, and the previously proposed New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine, in which Amnesty played an instrumental role during court hearings.    
I shared our work on the Right to Water and the fact that 20,000 First Nations people living on reserves in Canada have no access to running water or sewage, a basic human right recognized by the United Nations. I raised our concerns about discrimination against First Nations children  in Canada, with the federal government budgeting 22 percent less per child for children’s services in First Nations communities than what the provincial governments dedicate in other communities. There are often greater needs and a higher cost of service delivery in First Nations communities, especially in rural and remote areas, which leads to First Nations children often receiving a lesser standard of service than would be available off reserve. While it has been pointed out by Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society that underfunding of child welfare services is a violation of Canadian Human Rights Act, the government continues to resist increasing funding and the case is currently before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. 
Activists at the Encuentro expressed a great deal of interest in the situation that Indigenous Peoples in Canada are currently facing. Some commented at the end of my talk that they were surprised to hear that Indigenous Peoples in Canada face many of the same human rights violations that they see in their own countries. It seems Canada has held on to a reputation as a leader in human rights, despite many violations that occur every day within our own country. But discussing issues that are occurring across the Americas increased feelings of unity among all of us and also led us to think about how we might tackle these issues as a region. 
A word that was repeated frequently throughout the Encuentro was “solidaridad”—solidarity. We must all continue to advocate for justice in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples within Canada and internationally. After all, these are not just “indigenous issues”. They are issues of the utmost importance to all peoples in the Americas.

Solidarity. I’ve long known that solidarity is a foundational principle of Amnesty’s work, but my conception of what it actually means changed while in Mexico for an activism conference. I, and my colleagues from Amnesty Canada (Alex Neve, Kathy Price, Crystal Giesbrecht, and Andrea Oakunsheyld), had the rare privilege of meeting someone on whose behalf we campaign, Brenda Rangel Ortíz, and she changed my outlook on activism. 
Brenda Rangel Ortíz is up against seemingly insurmountable odds as she continues to search for her brother, Héctor Rangel Ortíz, who was disappeared after being stopped by the police on 10 November 2009 in the city of Monclova, Coahuila state. 
Brenda told us how the official investigation is going nowhere, and conveyed the frustration that accompanies the process of trying to find answers in a broken system. 
Brenda shared details of conversations she has had with government officials and police that instantly gave me goose bumps. She reported being threatened with attack and with imprisonment if she does not stop speaking out about the disappearance of her brother. She explained that it is not uncommon for the police to plant evidence in order to arrest innocent people—a finding well backed up in Amnesty’s latest report on torture and other types of misconduct by law enforcement in Mexico. 
While sharing the harrowing experiences she has day to day in the search for Héctor, Brenda broke down in tears. 
I expected to be moved by Brenda’s story, but I didn’t realise in what way and how strongly I would be affected. As she shared her struggle, I was overwhelmed at Brenda’s determination and strength while not hiding her emotion and fear at the thought of what has happened to her brother and what might happen to her. Seeing how much it meant to Brenda that we took the time to meet with her and to share what activists in Canada are doing to support the quest for answers about Hector gave me a new perspective on solidarity. 
I’ve never been one to write solidarity messages that are sometimes requested at the bottom of urgent actions. I have always taken the approach that if I’m going to write two letters, I’d prefer to write on behalf of two different cases in order to have a greater impact. As we sat and shared with Brenda and her family, I saw that her determination was bolstered by our presence. We don’t do this work to get thanks from people directly affected, but my fortunate circumstances granted me this reward. What clicked with me was that by expressing solidarity with the people named in our actions, you are fuelling the struggle for human rights from below, which is just as important, if not more important in some cases, than simply writing to governments. Writing solidarity messages, in addition to letters to governments, boosts the effectiveness of your action because it applies pressure from outside the country, while simultaneously strengthening those seeking change inside the country. It’s important to remember that there are more people than just Amnesty working on a case, and expressing solidarity with them, whether they be families, or courageous young lawyers with local human rights organisations such as the amazing Centro Prodh in Mexico City, boosts their spirits and, consequently, their determination to carry on the important work they are doing. 
During our conversation with Brenda in Mexico City, we were honoured to be introduced to members of her family  — all of whom are united in their courageous efforts to find Hector and their pain over his disappearance. Brenda’s mother spoke to us with strength, but her anguish was clear. Brenda’s husband told us how he had to quit his job as a lawyer with the government shortly after marrying Brenda. He was brought into a room, handed a resignation letter and told that due to his involvement with Brenda, unfortunately there was no future for him as a government employee. The trauma of Hector’s disappearance has clearly had far reaching implications on the whole family, including the children, and what is described here is only scratching the surface. 
Please take action to support the family of Hector Rangel Ortiz as they seek truth and justice. And remember to also write a message of solidarity!

Ten years ago the Canadian government established a judicial inquiry into the case of Maher Arar. That inquiry, over the course of more than two years of ground-breaking work, examined how Canada’s post-Sept. 11 security practices led to serious human rights violations, including torture. 
At that same time, 10 years ago and far away from a Canadian hearing room, I was mired in a nightmare of injustice, insidiously linked to national security. I have not yet escaped from that nightmare. 
As Canada once again grapples with concerns about terrorism, my experience stands as a cautionary reminder. Security laws and practices that are excessive, misguided or tainted by prejudice can have a devastating human toll. 
A conference Wednesday in Ottawa, convened by Amnesty International, the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group and the University of Ottawa, will reflect on these past 10 years of national security and human rights. I will be watching, hoping that an avenue opens to leave my decade of injustice behind. 
I was apprehended by U.S. forces during a firefight in Afghanistan in July 2002. I was only 15 years old at the time, propelled into the middle of armed conflict I did not understand or want. I was detained first at the notorious U.S. air base at Bagram, Afghanistan; and then I was imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay for close to 10 years. I have now been held in Canadian jails for the past two years. 
From the very beginning, to this day, I have never been accorded the protection I deserve as a child soldier. And I have been through so many other human rights violations. I was held for years without being charged. I have been tortured and ill-treated. I have suffered through harsh prison conditions. And I went through an unfair trial process that sometimes felt like it would never end. 
I am now halfway through serving an eight-year prison sentence imposed by a Guantánamo military commission; a process that has been decried as deeply unfair by UN human rights experts. That sentence is part of a plea deal I accepted in 2010. 
Remarkably, the Supreme Court of Canada has decided in my favour on two separate occasions; unanimously both times. Over the years, in fact, I have turned to Canadian courts on many occasions, and they have almost always sided with me. That includes the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal and the Alberta Court of Appeal. 
In its second judgement, the Supreme Court found that Canadian officials violated the Charter of Rights when they interrogated me at Guantánamo Bay, knowing that I had been subjected to debilitating sleep deprivation through the notorious ‘frequent flyer’ program. The Court concluded that to interrogate a youth in those circumstances, without legal counsel, “offended the most basic Canadian standards about the treatment of detained youth suspects.” That ruling was almost five years ago. 
I had assumed that a forceful Supreme Court ruling, coming on top of an earlier Supreme Court win, would guarantee justice. Quite the contrary, it seemed to only unleash more injustice. 
Rather than remedy the violation, the government delayed my return from Guantánamo to Canada for a year and aggressively opposed my request not to be held in a maximum security prison. It is appealing a recent Alberta Court of Appeal decision that I should be dealt with as a juvenile under the International Transfer of Offenders Act. 
No matter how convincingly and frequently Canadian courts side with me, the government remains determined to deny me my rights. 
I will not give up. I have a fundamental right to redress for what I have experienced. 
But this isn’t just about me. I want accountability to ensure others will be spared the torment I have been through; and the suffering I continue to endure. 
I hope that my experience – of 10 years ago and today – will be kept in mind as the government, Parliament and Canadians weigh new measures designed to boost national security. Canadians cannot settle for the easy rhetoric of affirming that human rights and civil liberties matter. There must be concrete action to ensure that rights are protected in our approach to national security. 
National security laws and policies must live up to our national and international human rights obligations. I have come to realize how precious those obligations are. 
That is particularly important when it comes to complicity in torture, which is unconditionally banned. 
I have also seen how much of a gap there is in Canada when it comes to meaningful oversight of national security activities, to prevent violations. 
And I certainly appreciate the importance of there being justice and accountability when violations occur. 
I want to trust that the response to last week’s attacks will not once again leave human rights behind. Solid proof of that intention would be for the government to, at a minimum, end and redress the violations I have endured.

Horns honked, children waved Tunisian flags, old men posed merrily for cameras and queues of voters spilled into school yards yesterday as Tunisians went to the polls in the first elections under the country’s new constitution, nearly four years after they took to the streets to protest against years of repression and abuse. Their enthusiasm was palpable, yet the success of the electoral process so far should not mask darker realities that persist in Tunisia. 
Since the 2010-2011 uprising that ousted the former president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, human rights violations have endured. 
This has been evident since we arrived in Tunis, where we watched families protesting against the torture of their loved ones at the hands of the security forces and calling for justice and accountability. Their stories backed up the reports we had been receiving for several weeks of cases of torture and deaths in custody. 
Little is still known about the structure of the Tunisian security forces, which have not been reformed since the uprising. 
Government officials and politicians claim that security is of prime importance following two political assassinations in 2013 and increased instability on Tunisia’s borders with Algeria and Libya, which the authorities have blamed on “terrorist” cells. But this has raised worrying questions about human rights. 
Just 48 hours before the elections, the security forces laid siege and stormed a house in a suburb of Tunis where gunmen were believed to be hiding, killing five women and a man and injuring a child in the process. The day before, an officer from the National Guard was killed in the stand-off. 
Impunity was one of the hallmarks of Ben Ali’s rule, yet the current authorities have also used security threats as an excuse to let members of the security forces get away with human rights violations. 
In August, two women were shot dead by police officers in Kasserine as they drove back home late at night from a wedding. The Ministry of Interior told us that the police officers had not been suspended, nor were they facing an internal investigation, as he said the death of the two women was the result of a “mistake” committed while they were protecting the area from terrorist threats. 
Tunisia’s counter-terrorism operations should not be used as an excuse to let security forces escape prosecution for the violations they commit. 
We were starkly reminded of the authorities’ infringement of other human rights when we met former prisoner of conscience Jabeur Mejri, who was pardoned for the second time on 14 October. 
Jabeur was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison in 2012 for online posts that were deemed offensive to Islam and the prophet Mohamed. He was first pardoned earlier in 2014, only to be imprisoned again for ‘insulting’ a public official. 
Amnesty International launched a manifesto for human rights on 24 September outlining 10 pledges every election candidate should commit to in order to deliver real human rights reforms. 
Since then, Amnesty International actively collected signatures from candidates and political parties in Tunisia and abroad, including at a conference in Tunis this month, during which 11 political parties signed our manifesto unreservedly. However, other parties were evasive or simply rejected pledges to abolish the death penalty. 
With the results of the legislative elections expected imminently, we will be closely monitoring steps taken to improve the human rights situation by the newly elected members of parliament. 
A new draft law on violence against women is expected to be presented on 25 November with a view to being adopted by the new assembly. As part of our campaign for the rights of women and girls to live free from sexual violence, we will urge the new authorities to adopt and implement a specific and comprehensive law to address gender-based violence. 
Tunisians have weathered a testing four-year transitional period, hopeful that their perseverance will lead to the fulfilment of their hopes and dreams for their country. Respect for human rights must be at the heart of the elections, as well as the actions of the new government. Only then can the aspirations of Tunisians and the 2011 uprising be truly achieved.

0,Central African Republic: Fear and Loathing in Bangui,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/central-african-republic-fear-and-loathing-in-bangui/,"By Joanne Mariner, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International , In Bangui’s Nguingo neighbourhood, up the Oubangui river from the city center, people are scared. , “There are rumors that the anti-balaka are going to attack again this afternoon,” a local resident told me when I...","By Joanne Mariner, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International 
,  
In Bangui’s Nguingo neighbourhood, up the Oubangui river from the city center, people are scared. 
,  
“There are rumors that the anti-balaka are going to attack again this afternoon,” a local resident told me when I visited there on Wednesday. 
,  
“They want to teach us a lesson.” 
,  
Over the past year, the Central African Republic has become notorious for the intensity of its sectarian violence. After the majority-Muslim Seleka government left power in January 2014, a wave of ethnic cleansing swept the country, leaving much of the territory entirely empty of Muslims. Thousands were killed. The seleka have also been responsible for serious abuses in various parts of the country including in the capital Bangui. 
,  
But the troubles in Nguingo, a subdistrict of Bangui’s Ouango area, are of a different sort. While Nguingo, like the rest of Ouango, once had a thriving Muslim community, those inhabitants fled long ago — chased away by the anti-balaka, a militia primarily made up of Christians and animists. With the Muslims gone — their houses sacked and their belongings stolen — the anti-balaka lost their easiest and most convenient targets. 
,  
Now, increasingly, the anti-balaka are using thuggish methods against Bangui’s non-Muslim communities, alienating even some of their former supporters. In an attack on the Nguingo neighbourhood carried out ten days ago, the anti-balaka killed three local residents, badly injured at least 20 more, and burned down some 28 houses and a church. 
,  
“I call them the band of bandits,” an older resident said angrily. “They think that because they have guns and machetes they can abuse us freely.” 
,  
Ongoing violence and revenge attacks 
,  
The anti-balaka’s incursion into Nguingo on 14 October was a revenge attack. Earlier that day a group of three anti-balaka fighters had entered the neighbourhood to steal. It was the second such raid in the space of a few days, and the people of the area were sick of it. 
,  
During the previous raid, the anti-balaka had stolen cars, motorcycles and equipment. With the help of Rwandan troops — based in the country under the auspices of a UN peacekeeping force — the local people were able to recover much of what had been taken, but they also steeled themselves to resist future depredations. 
,  
When the three anti-balaka fighters arrived on 14 October, local youth fought back, throwing a volley of heavy stones. Two of the fighters escaped, but a third, who was carrying an unloaded gun, was hit by stones and badly injured. Although his face was a bloody mess and some people at first thought he was dead, he survived, was brought to the local jail, and was handed over to the authorities. 
,  
Two hours later the anti-balaka returned, this time in force. According to police in the area, the local anti-balaka commander had requested reinforcements from a neighbouring commander in Boy Rabe, the city’s most notorious anti-balaka stronghold. While it is unclear just how many anti-balaka participated in the attack — estimates of the group’s size range from several dozen to well over 100 — everyone agrees that the men were well-armed, with Kalashnikovs and grenades, and primed for combat. 
,  
“They wanted to kill all the young men” 
,  
“The anti-balaka attacked from the north, shooting in the air and yelling, “come out, come out! All the men outside!” Therese, 55, told me. “They wanted to kill all the young men.” 
,  
The anti-balaka began by attacking the house of a neighbourhood leader — known as the chef du quartier “the boss of the neighbourhood” — holding him responsible for the fighting earlier in the day. While the leader himself managed to flee before they arrived, his neighbours were not so lucky. 
,  
Jacques Mamadou, 38, was shot and killed in front of his house as he tried to flee. The day I visited, his shoes and cap marked his freshly-dug grave, which had been placed next to the ruins of his house and just down the way from the ruins of the house of the neighbourhood leader. 
,  
Another victim was Constant Yaonomo, 24, a miller. His family lived right around the corner from the neighbourhood leader, and he was shot and killed, his parents believe, when he was running to get home. “He wanted to return to the family home when the fighting started,” his father told me, showing photos of Constant’s body. 
,  
“We didn’t know what happened to him until 8 pm, when the fighting had subsided, and my son-in-law came to the house and told us, ‘your son is dead.’ My wife was the first to open the door. When she heard the news she collapsed.” 
,  
“There was still some shooting but I didn’t care anymore; I went out onto the street to find his body. His clothes were soaked in blood. I washed his body and changed his clothes, putting my own suit on him. We buried him the next morning at 10 am. Most of the neighbors had fled, but a couple of them were still here, and they helped me dig the grave.” 
,  
The third victim was Gilles Francis Beaubiasso, a 24-year-old student. 
,  
According to his stepmother the family was fleeing when he was shot: he was hit by two bullets in his chest and left arm. 
,  
A number of other people suffered gunshot wounds, severe machete wounds, and shrapnel injuries from grenades. At least 20 people were treated at a nearby clinic, with some of the more serious cases being later brought to city’s main hospital for additional care. 
,  
Besides revenge, the anti-balaka also seemed to be motivated by the opportunity for profit. Setting fire to dozens of houses, whose thatched roofs are like tinder, the anti-balaka systematically robbed people as they ran out of the houses to escape the heat and smoke. 
,  
“They took money, mobile phones, women’s jewellery – everything they could get their hands on,” a 59-year-old man with a bandaged head told me. “I had nothing to give them so they hit me in the head with a machete.” 
,  
One woman spoke of how the anti-balaka pointed their guns at her young sons — ages 10 and 11 — and threatened to kill them if she didn’t pay. 
,  
“I gave them 30,000 CFA (around 58 US Dollars) to save my children.” 
,  
Role of the UN troops vital 
,  
Despite the attack’s violence, everyone agrees it could have been much worse. It was the arrival of UN peacekeeping troops — a Congolese contingent — that halted the killing. “If the Congolese troops hadn’t come,” one resident insisted, “it would have been a massacre.” 
,  
The anti-balaka engaged the Congolese troops for some time, then fled. 
,  
Yet local people fear that their retreat is temporary, and that they will be back again to take their revenge. Over 1,000 people have fled across the Ubangui River to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo; a hundred or so more have taken refuge at a nearby Catholic Church compound. Despite UN patrols, people do not feel safe. 
,  
What to do about thousands of anti-balaka fighters is one of the most difficult questions the country faces. Public perceptions of these groups may be changing, particularly as they lose all claim to being “self defense forces” and operate, as in Nguingo, as predatory criminal gangs. But their claim to power does not, in the end, rest on their legitimacy; it rests on their weapons, organization, and capacity for violence. 
,  
Until the anti-balaka are disarmed and their structures are dismantled, the violence is unlikely to end. Whether the UN peacekeeping force can manage to protect civilians from this violence is the real challenge.

She gives her insight into the largely youthful protests, which at their peak saw up to 100,000 people take to the streets. 
I wouldn’t say I am an organizer of the demonstrations – there is no one organizer here. But young people and students have definitely been the primary initiators. 
	I fell into this role quite unexpectedly. I first ran for students’ union president eight months ago with the intention of bringing students together and contributing where I was needed. I never expected events to unfold as they have. 
	There are people who say the scale of the demonstrations is a result of students playing a key role, and it’s true that some people came out in solidarity after the police used tear gas and pepper spray. It’s hard to say for sure what the turnout would have been had that not happened. However, I do believe people are staying on now because they have been moved by young people’s strong conviction in pursuing genuine democracy. I have also been very touched by the protestors who remained on the streets despite the use of tear gas. 
	The “politest” demonstratorsThese three weeks spent on the streets with my fellow demonstrators have been an intense experience. Many of us have become close friends who truly care for each other’s safety. I’ve also witnessed great self-discipline from students and young people. They have led the recycling of materials and resources at protest sites, and some have also volunteered to clean up the streets. 
	No one is directing these activities, but there are volunteers who spontaneously take up duties. For example, my hall mates from university turn up every morning and schedule shifts for themselves. I’ve also seen youngsters on bicycles delivering food to those who haven’t eaten. These acts of civic consciousness are reasons why we have been dubbed the “politest demonstrators”. I believe there are many strong bonds that have been forged here that will last for a long time. 
	I’m aware that our critics say the demonstrations have caused economic losses and bring inconvenience to people’s lives. We recognize some of that and have frequently apologized to those who have been affected, such as workers who have had to leave home early because of the traffic disruption. We have also at times tried to negotiate with demonstrators occupying roads so vehicles can go through, but we also respect the demonstrators’ choices if they insist on staying on the roads. The people on the streets see themselves as bargaining chips who can help us negotiate with the government. 
 What young people want 
	We are fighting for genuine democracy, but the increase in inequality is another reason why young people have turned out in such large numbers. We feel that social mobility is declining and the social ladder is very difficult for us to climb. 
	My parents worry greatly about my safety, but they also understand and share my political beliefs. They call me every day to make sure I’m safe and have also tried to persuade me to retreat. I have skipped classes for three weeks and, like everyone else, I am very keen to see a resolution. The upcoming dialogue with the government is definitely a positive development, but I’m not in a position to forecast what will come out of it. Unless there’s some real progress towards genuine universal suffrage, we will not budge.

	Former child soldier from Southern Sudan and current Toronto-based recording artist Emmanuel Jal continues to inspire as his Key tour crosses Canada. 
,  
	Last week, 900 students wandered into their gymnasium in Aylmer, Quebec expecting a simple presentation on human rights, but were greeted with pounding hip hop and Emmanuel Jal, leading an interactive and emotionally charged event. Emmanuel’s unique style of hip hop and message of peace and reconciliation engaged students and brought them along on his journey, through his happiest and darkest moments.

,  
,  
Throughout, he encouraged students to add their own voices and stories, with students from grades 7 to 11 sharing their understandings of conflict, peace and the importance of education. The chance to interact with Emmanuel, whose story of trekking to Ethiopia at 7 years old with 400 other children to escape war and for the chance of education, ended up as an arduous journey with only 16 boys surviving and reaching a refugee camp, where they were then recruited in the SPLA to fight.  His harrowing tale describing the desperation of starvation, the threat of cannibalism, the overcoming bitterness and hatred felt and his eventual escape with the help of a British aid worker, had students immersed from the beginning to the end. 
,  
	Emmanuel’s flowing presentation ended with ways students could get involved and make a change in their world. Part of this was an introduction to his current work with The Key is E, a social business channeling the power of education, entrepreneurialism and creativity to impact social change. Ending the event with one of his songs that can only be described as a peace anthem, led to a stage full of dancing and jumping students following along with Emmanuel’s dance moves. 
,  
 As I was told over and over by students visiting our Amnesty International Youth Information table, this is an event they won’t be forgetting soon! Emmanuel’s ability to spin a story, lit a fire in many students’ hearts, and we were overrun by eager students, looking to find out more about human rights issues, the current conflict in Sudan and ways they can take action! 
,  
	Emmanuel has been making his way through Canada this past month, with the kickoff of his 5th studio album “The Key”. With events including Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal along with many other cities, Amnesty joined Emmanuel at Zaphod’s in Ottawa where his audience went through a similar journey as the students in Gatineau, connecting to Emmanuel through different mediums including hip hop, spoken word and dance. 
,  
	Emmanuel relives his happiest and darkest moments through each performance he gives; bringing his message of peace to each person he meets.

But despite the international outcry, on any given day 80,000 people are locked in stark cells in inhumane conditions across the USA. 
When the thick solid metal door shut behind him, Steven was faced with his worst nightmare. He knew he would be forced to spend the following four years locked in a room only large enough to take two steps to either side. He would spend his every minute surrounded by nothing but three walls, a thin mattress, a concrete block for a table and a small sink. 
He knew the only human interaction he would have in the next 48 months would be a few words with his guards, who were not allowed to make conversation with him. 
Phone calls were banned – the mere fact of picking up a receiver to speak to a relative was considered too dangerous. Hugging another person was also out of the question – any visits from relatives would have to be conducted through a glass screen by phone. But nobody came to visit. 
“I immediately felt despair, confusion. I felt threatened,” said Steven, who now lives with his wife and seven-year-old son in California. 
Steven, who was 25 years old at the time, had been placed in an isolation cell in the Pelican Bay State Prison in California as punishment for having a fight with another inmate and spitting on a prison guard. 
And even though isolation was not new to him – he had previously spent four years in solitary confinement in a juvenile facility after he was convicted of carjacking – the thought of more time there was almost too difficult to bear. 
“When I was put in an isolation cell again, I felt I had some survival skills other people around me didn’t have and I knew when I was getting out but it was still terrifying But many people didn’t make it through, they killed themselves or went crazy,” he said. 
Steven spent most of the days that followed confined to the claustrophobic surroundings of his cell. He slept, ate his meals and washed there. Guards only allowed him out for 90 minutes a day, escorting him to a small yard where he would be able to walk eight steps each way and stare at the sun through a wire-mesh ceiling. 
The psychological impact of isolation didn’t take long to become painfully apparent. 
“It was always extremely cold and I was constantly hungry. Not being able to look at the distance also affects your sight and mind,” he explained. 
For the four years he was in isolation, he was only allowed to exchange a few words with other human beings. 
“You are stuck in that cell with all your thoughts. And no one to talk to about them. That can easily make you go crazy.” 
In 2002, four years after he first set foot into that small grey box, Steven was given 200 US dollars and shown to the prison’s door. There was no reintegration programme or help available. 
With no ID, skills or relatives nearby, he turned to drugs to cope. 
“I had no proper clothes, no friends, no job, no skills, nothing. The fact that I made it is unbelievable.” 
Steven eventually recovered from his addiction. Since then he married, had a child and enrolled in Berkeley University, where he is studying for an English degree. 
But despite seeing himself as one of the lucky survivors of a brutal prison system, he says he still often suffers from anxiety attacks and paranoia as a consequence of the years he spent in isolation. 
“Even now so many years later, I feel like I cannot connect with people. I have many people helping me with that but it is still affecting me.” 
Concrete tombs 
Steven’s ordeal is far from unusual. At any given time, 80,000 people in more than 40 US states are believed to be locked in concrete cells with limited access to fresh air or light and restricted human contact. 
No other country is known to be holding as many prisoners in isolation as the USA. The UN’s top expert on torture has said that such conditions of isolation can be cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
The practice of punishing inmates for long periods of time completely alone has many names. Some states call these cells “secure housing units”, “administrative segregation” or “restricted housing”. 
But what the technical names hide is the fact that the system seems specifically designed to dehumanize individuals to the largest extent possible, ignoring its long-term, and sometimes lethal, consequences. 
Prison authorities claim the system is only used to control the most violent inmates. In reality, minor infractions such as not obeying orders from a prison guard or the suspicion of gang affiliation, even when there’s very little evidence available, can land a prisoner in there. 
The combined impact of the lack of fresh air, sunlight, proper nutrition and human interaction – with some inmates not allowed any human contact for years or even decades – is known to have taken an extreme toll on the physical and psychological health of thousands. 
Many have experienced extreme weight loss while others have developed anxiety, depression, insomnia, hypertension, extreme paranoia, perceptual distortions and psychosis. In some cases, African American inmates have suffered drastic loss of skin pigmentation due to the lack of sunlight. 
Conditions are so severe that prisoners often self-harm or commit suicide. 
In September 2013, a man with a history of mental illness hanged himself in his cell after reportedly spending more than a decade in an isolation cell in the Administrative Maximum facility near Florence, Colorado, a federal prison notorious for its harsh conditions. 
The man had suffered psychotic symptoms which had allegedly been ignored by prison staff in the days before his death. 
Many inmates who have spent years, or decades, in isolation are released directly from their cells into the community with little support. Studies have found that the negative effects of prolonged isolation can continue long after release. 
“The USA’s isolation system is a shocking and outdated form of punishment which should have no place in any country purporting to respect human rights principles. The fact that anyone is able to survive the inhumanity of a system which seems specifically designed to break them is incredible,” said Tessa Murphy, Amnesty International’s Campaigner on the USA. 
40 years in a tomb 
Last October, the consequences of the inhuman system of holding people in isolation for long periods of time became crystal clear when Herman Wallace, a 71-year-old man held in prison in Louisiana died after a long battle with liver cancer. 
Herman had been placed in an isolation cell in 1972 after he was convicted of the murder of Brent Miller, a guard at the infamous Angola Prison in Louisiana. 
And even though there was no indication that his incarceration directly caused his cancer, there’s no question that the inhumane conditions he was held in for more than half his life took a massive toll on his physical and psychological health. 
For the more than four decades Herman was held in a 2×3 metre cell, fighting a legal battle to overturn his conviction – which relied on questionable evidence and testimonies. In October 2013, a federal judge overturned his conviction and allowed him to die a free man. 
No physical evidence linked him to the crime, not even the knife or the bloody fingerprints found at the scene. The testimony of the main prosecution witness was later revealed to have been bought by the state in return for favours, including a pardon. 
Herman had been convicted along with Albert Woodfox, 67, who still languishes in isolation in Louisiana. 
A federal court recently overturned Albert’s conviction for the third time. However, he remains in prison pending a further appeal by the state. 
“Herman’s death should have raised red flags over the potential lethal consequences of placing human beings in isolation for such long periods of time. US authorities must urgently release Albert and end this injustice,” said Tessa Murphy. 
Reforms 
Over the past few years, pressure from local activists and lawmakers, have brought about some reforms. 
But while some states, including Maine, Mississipi, Colorado, Washington State, and New York have made changes to how they use solitary confinement, there are worrying signs that the US government plans to expand its use in federal prisons with the opening of Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois. 
“Crime is a real issue in the USA and the authorities have the responsibility to address it. However, entombing people in these cruel conditions is clearly not the answer,” said Tessa Murphy. 
“Solitary confinement in the USA must be reserved only for the most exceptional cases, as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time. The USA must also allow international experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, Inhuman or degrading treatment, to visit these facilities.”

There appears to be a rise in homophobia around the world. From Russia and Kyrgyzstan to Nigeria, Uganda, and beyond, homosexuality is becoming further criminalized. This is particularly hard to understand here in Canada where we are steadily marching in the opposite direction—we have had marriage equality for a decade, and several provinces and territories have legislation in place to protect the transgender community from violence and discrimination. 
When we hear about new legislation criminalizing or further criminalizing same sex sexual conduct we are enraged. And we want to act. And when activists in Uganda ask us not to act—or at least not act in the ways we would normally work here at home—we are confused. We want to be supportive. We want to help. We want to send a message to the Ugandan government that LGBTI rights are human rights. And sometimes the hardest thing we can do is nothing. 
Today, Amnesty International released a report on discriminatory laws in Uganda. For the past few years much international attention has been focused on the Anti-Homosexuality Act, which was passed into law on February 24, 2015, but nullified months later on August 1, 2014 by the Constitutional Court because of a technicality—there weren’t enough people in court when the Bill passed to reach quorum. The Anti-Homosexuality Act, or AHA as its commonly known, included sweeping provisions criminalizing, amongst other things, vague and broadly defined offences, including “promoting homosexuality,” and “aiding and abetting homosexuality,” both of which carried maximum sentences of seven years in prison; and “aggravated homosexuality,” which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The AHA led to people being subjected to harrassment and violence because of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity. It led to violent attacks, people losing their jobs and housing, and being too afraid for their safety to access medical care.  
The AHA wasn’t the only discriminatory Bill to be passed in recent years. To understand where the AHA came from, and how to advocate for LGBTI rights in Uganda we need to look at what other discriminatory laws have been passed and what motivated their creation.  
The Anti-Pornography Act (APA) entered into force on May 9, 2014. It stipulates that “a person shall not produce, traffic in, publish, broadcast, procure, import, export, sell or abet any form of pornography,” or risk a fine or up to 10 years in prison. “Pornography” is poorly defined as  “any representation through publication, exhibition, cinematography, indecent show, information technology or by whatever means, of a person engaged in real or stimulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a person for primarily sexual excitement.” It has interpreted to mean that mini-skirts and other revealing clothing is banned, a belief fuelled by misinformed media reporting. This has led to attacks on women for perceived violation of the law. 
The Public Order Management Act 2013 (POMA) came into force on November 20, 2013. It  grants the authorities—specifically, the police— sweeping powers to prevent, stop, or regulate the conduct of all public meetings, which clearly violates the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. Activists are concerned the legislation was put in place to prevent protests like the Walk to Work protests against high fuel and food costs, and took place in 2011. The impact has been the cancellation or restriction of civil society activities. 
Three discriminatory laws—the AHA, APA, and POMA—all passed in less than a year. All have the effect of putting a chill on civil society engagement. All stifle democracy. All violate fundamental rights and are inconsistent with Uganda’s obligations under international human rights law. They are all vaguely worded and allow for selective interpretation and implementation. They have legitimized targeted of specific groups, primarily women and LGBTI people, by authorities and the public. And the failure of authorities to respond to this targeting of LGBTI people and women has led to increased violence and a growing climate of fear. 
Uganda is obligated to respect the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, the rights to freedom from discrimination and equality before the law, the right to privacy, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the rights to work and housing, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to an effective remedy. The government also has an obligation to take all appropriate measures to achieve the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on stereotyped roles for men and women. 
Where is are these laws coming from? The reasons are many and complex. They include the rising influence of religion on law-making, Uganda’s relationship with the Global North, cultural autonomy, and family values. Amnesty International has released a new report, Speaking Out: Advocacy experiences and tools of LGBTI activists in Sub-Saharan Africa which explores some of these issues in depth. It looks at how authorities in Uganda and elsewhere believe that the LGBTI rights movement comes from the West, and fails to recognize that the laws criminalizing homosexuality are a holdover from the colonial period. And it acknowledges the rise of US evangelical churches with anti-LGBTI views. 
So what can we do here in Canada? Given the Ugandan government’s sensitivities around LGBTI issues, and the perception that the LGBTI rights movement is being imported from the Global North, we have been asked not to directly target the Uganda government. Uganda has an active LGBTI activism community and they are domestically working to create societal and legal change. When they need us to take action they call on us to do so. Right now they are asking for our solidarity. They need us to keep reminding them that the world is watching and that they are not alone. They need us to continue raising their profile to offer them a layer of protection, same as we do with so many human rights defenders. And they need us to spread the word.

A...,"The federal government has approved the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam  in northern British Columbia despite the severe impacts it would have on the cultures and economies of Indigenous peoples in the region. 
The Site C dam would flood more than 80 km of the Peace River Valley. A joint federal/provincial environmental assessment found the dam would cause “profound” loss of natural habitat, would “severely undermine” First Nations, Métis and non-Aboriginal use of the area, and would submerge First Nations graves and others sites of cultural significance. 
In a decision released on October 14th, federal Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq said that the impacts of the project are “justified in the circumstances.” The Minister’s statement refers to jobs that will be created in the construction of the dam and the “clean, renewable energy” that will be produced. 
However, the joint review characterized the dam as imposing significant social and environmental costs that would be borne by the very communities least likely to share in its benefits.

The area directly affected by the Site C Dam is within the territory covered by Treaty 8. First Nations in the region have previously stated that if the Site C Dam is approved they will go to court to protect their rights. 
In approving the project, the federal government set out a number of conditions that BC Hydro must meet in the construction of the dam. None of these conditions makes explicit reference to Aboriginal and Treaty rights. Those conditions that do deal with impacts on Indigenous peoples provide little or no protection for their rights. 
For example, the decision contains only the vague requirement that BC Hydro develop mitigation measures that “could address impacts” on Indigenous peoples’ traditional land use. The mercury contamination of fish in reservoir area is accepted as a given and BC Hydro is required only to monitor the mercury levels and inform Indigenous peoples of the health risks. The conditions only require BC Hydro to “avoid, minimize or manage” impacts on graves and cultural sites.

The Site C dam would flood more than 80 km of the Peace River Valley.

In a decision released on October 14th, federal Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq said that the impacts of the project are “justified in the circumstances.” The Minister’s statement refers to jobs that will be created in the construction of the dam and the “clean, renewable energy” that will be produced.

Yoshi Garcia is a Salvadoran activist and self-styled “DJ with a conscience”. Aged 24, her interest in gender equality issues started when she was around 14. Since then, she has joined numerous campaigning organizations, including Agrupaçion (the Citizen’s Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion) and Jovenes Voceras y Voceros en los DS y DR (Youth Voices for Sexual and Reproductive Rights). Here, she tells us how she became a passionate advocate against El Salvador’s total abortion ban. 
 
When I was growing up, I was told that abortion was illegal. In school, you were taught about abortion from a religious perspective – that abortion is wrong. At first, I believed this. 
But I’ve had friends who got pregnant after they were raped by their fathers or by other men.  I’ve had friends who wanted an abortion because they didn’t feel ready to have children. In all these cases, their families forced them to have the baby. 
Then there was the solidarity campaign for Karina in 2009. Seven years earlier, she had had a miscarriage and went to the hospital for emergency care. But the health professionals denounced her to the police, assuming she had had an abortion. She was condemned to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide. Her case affected me a lot. 
That same year, I joined Radioactividad Joven, a youth group that uses theatre and radio to spread the word about sexual and reproductive rights. Radio provides a vital space for young people to have their say, and to raise awareness about these issues. It’s been a great personal achievement for me to be a part of that as a radio presenter and DJ. 
Through Radioactividad Joven, I was exposed to a lot of information about the different circumstances that push women to have an abortion. I also realized how much the total ban affects women’s lives. 
I discovered information about abortion and the ban that I hadn’t known before or that had been hidden from the public. I became convinced that this issue was much more about the fact that women should be free to make decisions about their own bodies. It was at this time that I really started campaigning for the decriminalization of abortion. 
One of the biggest challenges we face is how to change things – how to change the status quo. The government is closed and it doesn’t value young people. How can we reach those in power – the State? They don’t believe in young people. They won’t give us opportunities and they won’t listen to us. 
It’s not just the government. I have sometimes felt discriminated against in certain spaces or groups. People call you names like “abortista” or say “you are wasting your time”, “nothing is going to change”, or “you’re too young”. 
You get more hassle if your activism is visible, for example, if you wear a campaign t-shirt at university or in the street. But you get used to it with time. 
When I first started doing street theatre on the criminalization of abortion, it was very hard. People were shocked and couldn’t believe we were talking about this issue in public. It even made the newspapers. 
But things have changed a little. I can see that people are now more informed. I think they have more information from social media, and the Beatriz case last year also helped to change attitudes. Change is happening bit by bit. 
I have seen changes in attitudes in my family and among my friends. The case of “Las 17” has had a huge impact on many of my friends. At first they thought these women deserved to be in prison, but when I told them the women’s stories they changed their minds. 
I am a Tallerista – I see myself as an educator.  Through the workshops that I give I try to plant a seed of change. I am the present, trying to make a change for the future. Even if I won’t be able to enjoy this change, I know that future generations will. 
I met lots of youth activists in September at an Amnesty human rights education training programme for young people in Argentina. We shared different ways of mobilizing others to protect and promote sexual and reproductive rights in Latin America. I realized we are not alone. It filled me with positive energy and made me more determined to continue with the fight. 
Help Yoshi keep up the fight to decriminalize abortion in El Salvador. Write a letter today. 
Sexual and reproductive rights are human rights. My Body My Rights is Amnesty International’s global campaign to defend these rights. Find out more.

The breathlessness was overwhelming. Standing in that small, dark cell, surrounded by nothing but three concrete walls, a dank toilet, a small sink, a thin mattress, a concrete slab and a perforated metal door that barely let any air in, the oppressive claustrophobia was hard to control. 
This was not the first time I had set foot in a US prison, but it was the first time I had experienced what an isolation cell can do to you. 
Everything about that room – the lack of windows, or natural light, or fresh air, the very thought of not being allowed any human interaction – seems to be designed to dehumanise. The basic penal concept of reform and social rehabilitation is excluded inside those three walls. 
In solitary, punishment is king. The mere thought of spending more than a few minutes in that place was almost unbearable. 
And then, a prisoner told me and my colleague that we were the first outsiders he had seen in 22 years. 
I was surprised even to be allowed into California’s infamous Pelican Bay Prison. Correctional authorities across the US are unwilling to allow anyone to see what happens behind those thick concrete walls. And with evidence that has emerged – from Pennsylvania to Arizona, of voices crying for help – it’s no wonder. Across the US, it is estimated that nearly 80,000 people are held in long-term isolation 
The authorities describe the system as “secure housing units”, “administrative segregation” and even “restricted housing.” But these euphemisms do not describe the human reality of these units. 
The departments of corrections claim only prisoners who are a threat to guards or to other inmates are placed in isolation, after all other measures to control them fail. But as indicated by the tens of thousands detained, isolation cells are routinely used as punishment for minor offences such as disrespecting a prison guard or disobeying an order. In California, for example, suspected gang members can be placed in those dimly lit cells, just for having a calendar with Mayan symbols, or certain tattoos, or for being in the possession of books or other “source items” – or just for speaking to a “validated” inmate. 
America’s prison isolation regime is not unusual, but it is cruel. Prisoners across the country are effectively entombed for nearly 22 hours a day in their cells, with no access to any education or rehabilitation programmes, with warehousing for the mentally ill in Arizona, with a man in Louisana who has been held in solitary since 1972. Prisoners must take their meals in the confines of those walls and are rarely given a chance to have any meaningful interaction with another human being. At all. 
The only time prisoners in isolation are allowed to breathe outside air is when they are taken, alone, to a small outdoor yard, or cage, for “exercise”. Exercise is the word used by prison guards to describe the chance to walk a few steps back and forth. In California, following a hunger strike, prisoners were frequently given a chin-up bar and a hand ball, if they were allowed any recreation at all. 
Some prisoners have literally lost their sanity due to the lack of human interaction – and estimated 30-50% of all inmates in solitary confinement are mentally ill or cognitively disabled, and 20% of those are severely mentally ill. Others have completely lost skin pigmentation because of the extreme lack of sunlight. And still others have taken their own lives after having little else to fill the time but stare at a wall for more than 20 hours every day. 
But despite the plethora of horror stories emerging from the solitary cells across the US, the system remains unabated, and thousands of people remain entombed. 
Thanks to pressure from local activists, lawmakers and organisations like Amnesty International, some states – like Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New York, Virginia and Washington state – have introduced some reforms over the last few years. 
However, at the federal level, the US government is currently planning to expand the use of solitary confinement: the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) bought a correctional facility in Illinois two years ago, and this year’s BOP budget includes a proposal to reopen it as a federal supermax prison, potentially replicating the harsh isolation regime from its predecessor. 
But how do these conditions of detention provide justice for anyone? This system prioritises retribution and warehousing of inmates over their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. 
There is widespread national and international agreement about the harm caused by incarceration in isolation. The United Nations’ top expert on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment has called for solitary confinement to be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, and for as short a time as possible. He has repeatedly requested to visit super maximum security prison facilities, but the US state department has not allowed this. 
Violent crime is a real issue in the US and elsewhere. But incarcerating people for years and even decades in solitary confinement should not be the way forward for any country purporting to respect human rights. A prison management tool that has been lambasted by human rights bodies and is increasingly challenged by penal experts and others is costly, ineffective and inhumane. 
The US should focus its energy and resources on ensuring conditions of detention are compatible with its obligations under international law and standards – that the penitentiary system works for the social rehabilitation of prisoners, instead of perpetuating an abusive and cruel regime that is an affront to human rights.

The photos arrived in a steady stream on my Facebook feed, a flood of images too numerous to include here – impossible to ignore. From the wide boulevards of Mexico’s capital to the streets of small towns across the country, women and men, young and old, thousands and thousands of them, marched in protest, united in their outrage about what was done in Guerrero State. 
 
 
On September 26, 80 students of a rural teacher-training college had come to the town of Iguala to collect money for their studies, a common practice as young people from marginalized Indigenous and farming communities rely on donations to pay for food and supplies. The students were leaving town in three buses when they were blocked by municipal police who opened fire without warning. A number of students were injured in the gunfire, at least one of them fatally. More than 20 were taken away by police but authorities later denied any knowledge of them. When journalists arrived and the remaining students, in shock, began to tell what had happened, an unmarked vehicle approached and gunmen in civilian clothes opened fire again. More students were killed, as well as several people who happened to be in the area. Others disappeared. 
The next day, the body of one young student was found, showing signs of torture. His face had been skinned and his eyes were gone. Fears mounted for the 43 missing students last seen being arrested by municipal police or taken away by gunmen. 
Since then unmarked mass graves have been discovered with the charred remains of at least 28 bodies. Are they the remains of some of the disappeared students or of other victims, given the exponential increase in reports of disappearances in the past eight years? Family members of the students have provided DNA samples and at their request, independent international forensic experts are assisting with the identification process. 
It is this heart-rending scenario that has moved Mexico’s civil society to action, along with widespread concerns about the indifference and complicity of state officials whose duty should be to protect its young people. Banners bearing the words “Alive they were taken, alive we want them back” have been prominent at march after march. Others proclaim “Todos somos estudiantes” – “We are all students”. 
Canada is Mexico’s partner in NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a major source of investment. Tourism from Canada and other exchanges mean the Mexican government is attentive to what Canadians have to say. For this reason, it is vital that we join with the families of the students and all those who have courageously taken to the streets in protest, despite the ever-present fear of violent retaliation. It is vital that we raise our voices relentlessly for action to find the missing students, to defend their rights, and to bring to justice all those responsible for this unspeakable attack. Silence is simply not an option.

	In the fleeting September warmth, the flowerbeds are blooming, the verges are well kept and a busload of tourists are busily snapping photos on the edge of this pleasant, tree-lined plaza not far from the Kremlin. 
	But like much in Russia today, first impressions can be deceptive. Bolotnaya’s seeming tranquillity belies the central role it played in the country’s growing repression of basic freedoms. 
	On 6 May 2012, a very different scene played out in this square. 
	Hundreds of riot police, kitted out in military-style camouflage and helmets, and wielding truncheons, charged into crowds of mostly peaceful anti-government protesters who had gathered on the eve of President Vladimir Putin’s controversial return to power. 
 
Dozens of protesters were left bloodied and bruised by the police use of excessive and unlawful force. Hundreds more were hauled into detention. 
	Criminal proceedings were later brought against around 30 of the protesters. The authorities described the predominantly peaceful event as “mass riots”, to justify the heavy-handed police response and allow heavier charges against the accused. 
	When people took to the streets of Moscow and other Russian cities again in February this year to protest peacefully against the unjust guilty verdicts in the Bolotnaya show trials, hundreds more were detained and charged with participation in “unauthorized gatherings”. 
	Amnesty International has campaigned in depth on the trials of some of the Bolotnaya protesters, which rocked many in Russian society and shocked the world. But those headline cases are just the tip of the iceberg in the authorities’ wider bid to crush the freedoms of assembly and expression. 
 Here are the stories of two more individuals caught up in the crackdown: 
	Kseniya Metrokhina, a very animated 50-year-old academic and cancer survivor, doesn’t describe herself as an activist. 
	She steered clear of demonstrations until late 2011, when she saw on Facebook that the security forces began cracking down on students and others protesting in Moscow against alleged election fraud. They were the biggest protests in recent Russian history. 
	Along with her daughter and other residents, she tried to help detained students by bringing sandwiches and water to the police stations where they were held. 
	Initially cautious of the demonstrators, but curious to find out more about them, she was soon lured in by the festive mood and communal spirit. 
	“I’d say there’s nothing more sensational than being part of a community,” she said. She was surprised to find out that the protesters were not a faceless mob, but ordinary people just like her. 
	Kseniya created crafts to express herself in acts of performance art. On one occasion, she made small origami pigeons to distribute to the crowd. Another time, she dyed tagliatelle in the colours of the Russian flag, donned a big chef’s hat and dished it out to passers-by with pieces of shredded newspaper – a form of protest against the “lies” she said the Russian media were feeding people.  
	On 6 May 2012, she and her daughter were among the crowd marching towards the massive opposition demonstration in Bolotnaya Square when they saw hundreds of riot police and numerous police vans lining the surrounding streets, blocking some of the exits. She said their helmets and riot gear made the police look “like astronauts”. 
	Kseniya and her daughter never even made it into the square that day because the protest was violently dispersed and the organizers arrested. By now, she had gained a taste for peaceful protest, but had to stay off the streets for a time after being stricken with breast cancer. 
	After recovering, in early 2014 she was once again moved to protest in public to show her opposition to Russia’s sabre-rattling over Ukraine. This is what earned Kseniya her first detention and trip in a police van. She was among several peaceful demonstrators arrested on 1 March 2014 for protesting outside a federal building against a vote to approve Russian troop deployment to Ukraine. 
	A pro-government reporter questioned them about their actions before they were arrested and taken to a local police station. Not having any orders about what to do with the detainees, the police let them go. 
	Despite this, she was undeterred and the next day she joined a much larger anti-war protest in central Moscow’s Manezhnaya Square, near the Kremlin, where she was again detained and subsequently prosecuted. 
	She lamented the madness of recent months as the Russian authorities have scrambled to quash dissent – particularly around the war in Ukraine: “Our life has become very sad and absurd.” After her brushes with the authorities, she realizes how little space there is for freedom of expression. 
 Evgeny Belyakov, a 27-year-old human rights activist originally from Vladivostok in Russia’s easternmost reaches, was also detained twice in the space of a few days at peaceful protests in Moscow. 
	On 21 February 2014, he wanted to show his support for the Bolotnaya protesters after a Moscow court handed down guilty verdicts, in what Amnesty International called a “hideous injustice”. So he made his way to join a spontaneous mass gathering in the streets outside the court. 
	By the time he arrived late that afternoon, hundreds of people had already been detained and taken away in police vans, for participating in an “unauthorized gathering”. 
	It wasn’t long before Evgeny joined them. He was simply walking around looking for his friends when a riot police officer approached him and called him a drug addict before arresting him. 
	“He never said his name or why I was being detained,” Evgeny said. 
	He was bundled into a van with dozens of other men and taken to a police station. They were released after three hours – the legal limit for such detentions. 
	The next day when Evgeny told two neighbours about his ordeal, they answered: “You should shut up with all your demonstrations, because there’s a war coming!” One of them crumpled up his paperwork from the police and threw it on the ground. 
	When the Bolotnaya activists were sentenced on 24 February, Evgeny again joined a spontaneous mass gathering near the Duma, Russia’s Parliament. Hundreds of people were again detained, both there and outside the court. 
	“The police were pushing everyone around, including tourists. They said the Metro [underground train station] was closed and the whole area was blocked,” he said of the scene. The mood was electric, if a bit confused. Every once in a while, someone would scream out a political slogan: “Freedom for political prisoners”, calls for Putin to resign, chants from Ukraine’s EuroMaydan demonstrations. 
	Police began picking people out from the crowd and pulling them into police vans. Evgeny said he was standing near the opposition leader Alexei Navalny when both of them were bundled into a van, along with other bystanders, including two Latvian tourists. Navalny was placed under house arrest several days later. 
	Evgeny was eventually found guilty of participating in an “unauthorized gathering” and shouting slogans, and fined 20,000 Rubles (approx. USD 525) – equivalent to his monthly rent. He rejects the charges and refuses to pay the fine. 
	Evgeny seemed bemused by the whole affair: “It’s completely arbitrary – you feel that just anyone can be detained. You wonder what else they might do. There seems to be completely free interpretation of any legislation.” 
	Kseniya and Evgeny are just two of the hundreds of ordinary Russians who have fallen foul of the authorities’ growing restrictions on the rights to freedom of assembly and expression. But their stories show how people are still speaking out to defend those rights. 
	Despite the rapidly shrinking space for freedom of expression, many people in Russia are speaking out. Between 6 and 12 October Amnesty International activists stand with them in solidarity during a week of action to make sure Russia’s leaders know that the rest of the world will not be silent.

It would be...","“Our people have a deep connection with this land because our ancestors told the stories and legends that are connected to that valley.” Chief Liz Logan, Treaty 8 Tribal Association, testifying before the environmental impact assessment of the proposed Site C hydroelectric dam. 
It would be impossible to flood more than 80 km of pristine river valley without having a massive impact on local ecosystems and the people who depend on them. 
The environmental impact assessment of the proposed $8 billion Site C hydroelectric dam in Northern British Columbia is clear that flooding such a large section of the Peace River valley would “severely undermine” First Nations, Métis and non-Aboriginal use of the area for hunting, trapping, and gathering plant medicines; would make fishing unsafe for at least a generation; and would submerge burial grounds and other crucial cultural and historical sites. 
In short, the panel concluded that the project would have “significant environmental and social costs” and that these would be borne by the people least likely to benefit from the project. 
The decision of whether or not to approve the construction is now in the hands of the federal Cabinet.  
With the environmental and social impacts established, the question that the Cabinet must answer is whether or not these harms can ever be justified. 
In this context, it’s crucial that the federal government not make the same mistake as project proponent, BC Hydro, which has clearly downplayed the importance of Indigenous land rights and the full extent of governments’ obligation to respect and uphold these rights. 
The environmental assessment report noted that there was no disagreement that the effect on habitat would be “profound” and irreversible. BC Hydro, however, has claimed that the impact on Indigenous rights may not be significant since Indigenous peoples would have the option of “adapting” their way of life to use land and waters in other parts of the region. 
As the environmental assessment itself points out, BC Hydro’s claim ignores the importance of these specific lands and territories to the Indigenous peoples who live on them. 
The Treaty 8 Tribal Association has strongly opposed the plan as a violation of the commitments made to them in their Treaty with the Crown and vowed to fight the project in court if needed. 
Liz Logan of the Fort Nelson First Nation told the environmental assessment panel, “We hope that we’ve demonstrated how important our relationship to the land is, and we hope that we are able to articulate to you who we are as people.” 
The environmental assessment also points out that Indigenous peoples in the region have already lost access to vast areas of land and waters due to the cumulative impacts of previous dams, large-scale oil and gas development and other industrial development and that the same region is now targeted for further development of natural gas. 
The panel called BC Hydro’s claims that Indigenous land rights could simply be exercised somewhere else in the region “superficial” and “unsupported.” 
Significantly, the environmental assessment also questioned the basic rationale for the project, noting that the additional generating power may not be required in the timetable that was set out and that alternatives had not been properly explored. 
Indigenous peoples’ rights to live on the land — and make their own decisions about how the land should be used — are protected in the Canadian Constitution, in historic and contemporary Treaties, and in international human rights standards such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
Across this spectrum, there is clear consensus that a very high standard of precaution is always required in any decision that could affect Indigenous peoples’ relationship to their traditional lands and territories, particularly where the economies and cultures of Indigenous peoples have already been harmed by previous government actions. 
Amnesty International supports the conclusion of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that in almost all cases large scale resource development projects should proceed only if the Indigenous peoples who may be affected have given their free, prior and informed consent. 
We strongly believe that this standard of protection is consistent both with Canada’s obligations under international human rights law, and with the Canadian Constitution as it has been interpreted in a series of Supreme Court decisions, up to and including this year’s landmark decision on the Tsilhqot’in title case.

They have been mobilizing through frontline work in communities for over 10 years, addressing structural and systemic colonial violence. Follow the NYSHN  on Twitter and Facebook. 
Amnesty International talked to members of the Native Youth Sexual Health Network as part of a series of conversations with activists and leaders marking the 10th anniversary of the Stolen Sisters report on violence against Indigenous women. We asked the NYSHN for their reflections on progress made and remaining challenges in making sure that there are No More Stolen Sisters. Here is what they had to say. 
“October 4th to me, means many things. It means acknowledging and thanking our ancestors for passing on the knowledge we need, to continue to take care of our families. It means continuing to build each other, our Nations and ourselves up. It’s about acknowledging the many medicines, people, and memories in my bundle, but I think most of all October 4th is a reminder that we do what we need to and what we can, and we do it for the love of our people.” – Alexa Lesperance, Youth Facilitator, Native Youth Sexual Health Network 
“October 4th is the culmination of radical political interventions that continue to restore spaces for a queer, Indigenous feminist praxis that unapologetically re-centers female- and Two Spirit-identified Indigenous folks to disrupt the ongoing violence of heteropatriarchal settler colonialism.”– Billy-Ray Belcourt, Youth Facilitator, Native Youth Sexual Health Network 
Responses to violence look different from nation to nation, and we recognize that this range depends on where communities are at, and that there is strength in many approaches. 
What we are doing to address colonial gender-based violence and the issues of missing and murdered Indigenous women. 
In addition to participating in different national Sisters in Spirit events on October 4th, here are a few example of the ways that we are mobilizing on the ground in communities every single day to address colonial gender-based violence: 
We are also continuing to work on strengthening different cultural supports within our communities so Elders and knowledge keepers are better informed to support Two-Spirit and LGBTTQQIA-identified youth and community members. Homophobia and transphobia often drive young people away from their families and communities. Working to decolonize and reclaim values of acceptance and love can prevent violence in the long term, while also increasing the visibility of informal support networks and existing Two-Spirit mentors, aunties, uncles, grandparents and Elders. In Toronto we will soon be launching an Two Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ Elders and Mentors Circle. 
We are also mobilizing with other Indigenous peoples and communities across the United States and Canada: 
In our daily frontline work by and for Indigenous youth we often hear about experiences of violence that directly impact young people. We also listen to and support what they want to see in terms of community-based responses. 
Supporting Indigenous youth means not policing the violence we experience or having to validate to others what violence is and how it is experienced. For example, when we are in a community where a young person has recently committed suicide, or when a young person discloses to us that they have experienced sexual violence, or that their mom has been murdered, we affirm that we believe their realities and stories. When hearing these stories we don’t shame youth for the feelings that they have or the ways they need to take care of themselves (i.e. drinking, using drugs, cutting). The reality is that we don’t have the privilege to experience things in separate boxes. Addressing what is happening regarding missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW), doesn’t happen without also talking about about land theft and how violence against MMIW is normalized because of ongoing violence to our environment. We can’t talk about violence or MMIW without talking about the extreme poverty, lack of housing, racism, and the discrimination we face. This is why we support a range of responses from nation to nation. We work from a place of self-determination, centering the voices of Indigenous youth. Our work is about meeting people where they are at, and that looks different for each person. We have to respond and cope with the tools we have as young people as best as we can. There is no waiting on government funding. In many cases we also hear about how many of the systems that are set up to ‘help’ youth actually create and sustain such violence. 
Confronting the realities of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit and gender non-conforming people also means holding colonial governments accountable for the ways in which they perpetuate violence, in part by not recognizing the immediacy of this issue. 
People in our communities every day are disrupting the intergenerational cycles of violence and abuse that stem from the legacy and continuation of colonialism. This includes breaking historical legacies, such as the removal of children from their communities (via residential schools, sixties scoop, foster care), and police violence (i.e. starlight tours and the ongoing physical violence to Indigenous people and elders) as just two examples. 
Indigenous youth are not just ‘partners’ in breaking the cycles of violence. We need to continue to lead and respond to the traumas that have been built into and on our bodies. For us, community safety doesn’t mean an increased police presence in our territories or the ongoing policing of our bodies. It comes in the form of addressing the intergenerational cycles of violence that come from colonization, the exploitation of our lands, the disregard for our bodies as Indigenous youth and the desire to ‘save us’ without actually addressing any systemic forms of violence. 
In the future we would like to see more support for Indigenous youth-led responses to colonial gender-based violence, with a focus on supporting the self-determination of our bodies, territories and nations. But this isn’t about being by ourselves either; we need our Elders, grandparents, and cross-generational mobilization to create medicines for the future.

No one thought it would happen, but it has. 
After more than a decade of determined struggle for recognition of years of human rights abuses, members of the Indigenous People of Sarayaku in the Ecuadorian Amazon, will receive an official apology by the Ecuadorian State. 
The historic day is 1 October, when four Ministers (Justice, Environment, Defence and Non-Renewable Natural Resources) and the Attorney General will arrive at the Amazon region to apologize for the abuses that took place during the oil operations carried out by the company CGC in their territory from 2002 to 2003. 
In those years, company staff, accompanied by soldiers and private security guards, carried out detonations, cut down trees, dug more than 400 wells, buried more than 1.4 tons of high grade explosives and polluted the environment with the noise of helicopters. The State had given the company the concession to exploit oil in their territory without consulting or informing the community beforehand. 
“For the Kichwa people of Sarayaku this is an act of historical significance because it is the first time that the State is going to apologize to an Indigenous community for having put at serious risk their lives and integrity”, Felix Santi, President of the Indigenous people of Sarayaku, told me reacting to the news. 
“Our people hope that the State’s apology is sincere and that there is a real guarantee that the abuses we suffered in our territory won’t be repeated”.	For years Amnesty International has accompanied this Indigenous community in its campaign to enforce their rights. For us, this is also a day of celebration. 
A public apology is part of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ ruling of 27 July 2012. The Court condemned the Ecuadorian State for violating their rights to communal property, to consultation, to cultural identity, to judicial protection and for having put at serious risk the lives and safety of members of the Sarayaku community. 
During the hearing at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Patricia Gualinga, leader of the Sarayaku, said “we have come here from far away because we believe that the Court can help us, this is our last resort and our last hope”. 
After more than ten years of litigation, and two years and three months after the ruling, the State is going to recognize its responsibility by travelling to the Sarayaku’s territory to apologize. 
Felix Santi also told me that the people of Sarayaku are expecting more than 1,000 people from all the surrounding communities and representatives of international organizations. They are organizing an event that will be creative, dynamic and colourful. Besides the central act of recognition when the Minister of Justice will read a text that has been negotiated with Sarayaku, the event will include music, ritual acts, a welcome ceremony by the Sarayaku leaders, a speech by the President of the Sarayaku and a traditional lunch with all the guests. 
Travelling to Sarayaku, never easy, will be by canoes and aircrafts, and the younger people and children of the community have been helping for days to arrange transportation. 
“The act of 1 October is of great significance for the Indigenous movement and an important point of reference not only for the Indigenous people of Sarayaku but for all Latin American Indigenous peoples. We mustn’t forget, however, that once the State offers its apology, there are other key measures to be fulfilled. One is the removal of explosives, including both those buried close to the surface and deeper. This process is being planned already but it will take time, because once the field survey is done and before starting with the removal, an environmental impact study must be carried out, and this will take three months”, continued Santi. 
“Not forgetting, of course, the measures of non-repetition, the approval of a Consultation Law that will ensure that before any oil activity is carried out in the territory of Sarayaku or any other Indigenous people, there must be a consultation that ensures free, prior and informed consent”, Santi said. 
This act is an important symbolic step in the right direction and will certainly be celebrated by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, who, as with the Sarayaku, have been excluded for centuries from decisions taken by States and other powerful actors on key aspects of their lives often with disastrous consequences for their physical and cultural survival. 
Amnesty International celebrates this public apology and hopes that it will open the door to a real guarantee of the right to consultation and free, prior and informed consent in Ecuador and the region. This is the only guarantee of non-repetition of human rights violations such as those that occurred in Sarayaku.

This act is an important symbolic step in the right direction and will certainly be celebrated by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, who, as with the Sarayaku, have been excluded for centuries from decisions taken by States and other powerful actors on key aspects of their lives often with disastrous consequences for their physical and cultural survival. 
,  
Amnesty International celebrates this public apology and hopes that it will open the door to a real guarantee of the right to consultation and free, prior and informed consent in Ecuador and the region. This is the only guarantee of non-repetition of human rights violations such as those that occurred in Sarayaku.

The exhilarating energy filling the city’s main roads, crowded with hopeful protesters, is something I have not seen since I was a young student back in 1989, when we took to the streets in solidarity with the Tiananmen protesters. 
But not even then had so many people taken to the streets in Hong Kong – nor had the police’s response been so brutal. 
What started as a student protest around a week ago has now taken over large parts of Hong Kong, with citizens claiming nothing but to be allowed to have a say on how their city is run, and by whom. 
As I stand on a footbridge in front of the Central Government’s office I can hardly believe my eyes – thousands of people are sitting on the pavement, braving the rain, holding placards reading “I want universal suffrage”. 
One by one speakers take turns to give short five minute presentations, the crowds clapping and chanting pro-democracy slogans as each one ends. They sing songs about freedom. 
The images of police firing tear gas against peaceful protesters is still fresh in everyone’s minds but tonight people seem hopeful, more positive. Tonight, there’s no riot police to be seen. 
When demonstrations began a few days ago no one expected events would turn as dark as they did. 
By the end of Friday, so many people had joined in the rallies that police declared the protests in the Civic Square illegal and began using pepper spray against those in the area, rapidly escalating tensions. 
Arrests quickly followed with many, including 17-year-old student leader Joshua Wong, taken away in handcuffs. 
The following day, people in Hong Kong woke up in anger and protests in front of the government offices swelled again towards the evening. Hundreds joined in as the sun came down – many equipped with goggles, umbrellas and cling film to protect themselves from the potential of tear gas being used against them. 
The atmosphere then was at times festive, with some demonstrators expressing their views through art and dance. But things escalated once again on Sunday when anti-riot police in full gear were sent to Harcourt Road and confronted thousands of men and women who walked right up to them in defiance. 
Lines of umbrellas used as shields against the tear gas blossomed. 
Venus Cheng, the vice chair of Amnesty International Hong Kong, told me she witnessed the violence escalating. 
“At around 7pm, people standing on the bridge above us saw a crowd of riot police approaching. Some young people tried to stop them and they were attacked. One protestor was being beaten even after he had fallen to the ground.” 
Venus tried to pull the man away but ended up being shoved at with a shield by a police officer. When she stood her ground, a second police officer sprayed pepper spray directly into her face, while another hit at her thigh with his baton. 
Minutes later, the police dispensed another round of tear gas, forcing Venus to retreat with the other demonstrators to another district. 
“Even though I was wearing goggles and a mask, the tear gas kept making me retch and vomit and I couldn’t keep my eyes open as I ran,” she said. The confrontation between the police and demonstrations continued until 4am on Monday morning. 
Because of the strong public outcry to the severe police crackdown, authorities withdrew the riot police on Monday and again allowed access to the area around the government offices. But no one knows how long the demonstrations will go on or what the reaction of the police will be. 
The situation remains tense. 
“What do these protests mean?” friends from across the world have been asking me. There’s no simple answer to that question. 
Echoes of the word Tiananmen have been heard over the last few days, on the radio, on TV and on the streets, but whether these protests are different and will herald any change is yet to be seen. 
In the meantime, what is clear is that people are ready to speak their minds, and that is exactly what Hong Kong and mainland China needs.

Her cousin Tashina General was murdered in 2008. Bev has recently been working with Ending Violence Association British Columbia, to design and lead knowledge sharing workshops on how to build safety in Indigenous communities.  
I spoke with Bev as part of a series of conversations with Indigenous women activists and leaders to mark the 10th anniversary of the Stolen Sisters report and the ongoing struggle to stop violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
What’s the most important thing for Canadians to understand about what’s happening to Indigenous women and girls in this country? 
I think it’s really important to understand the reasons why there is this epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women. 
I’ve been remembering my meetings with families and rereading their stories and the notes that I took during the meetings I had with all the families. It’s still very emotional for me. One of the things I remember in those meetings is that it wasn’t only the loss of one person, it was also all those historical traumas  — the traumas that came from residential schools, the sixties scope, the whole child welfare system, the jail system, the young offender system. It’s just so horrific, to have experienced all those traumas and to add on a horrible murder, a missing person. It’s just so horrific for anybody to have to experience that. 
And I think one of the messages is for Canadians to care. That’s it. I want them to care about what’s happening . I want them to care about the families that have been traumatized. I want them to care about why this is happening. I want them to care that this is a systemic problem and that’s we’re all responsible. That’s what my message would be. 
One thing that I remember from the conversations with family members leading up to the Stolen Sisters report, is that while we were looking for the patterns, while we were trying to understand the role of history and the role of contemporary society, the family members themselves often said how isolated and alone they felt.   
The isolation is still felt by most of the families but it has changed a little bit for some families because now there’s been a lot of movement by communities, by advocates and by the families themselves. Over the last ten years since the Stolen Sisters report, there’s been a lot more support in that way. But if I were to talk still with some of those families, they would still feel some of that isolation because they’re still having to survive it. 
I’m talking even about my own family. After all those years of advocating for families, my own family had to deal with a loss, with a murder.  I know that the trauma affected not our family, but also it impacted the community, is very difficult to heal from. 
Bev, you said that wanted Canadians as a society to show that they care about the lives of these women and girls, to acknowledge that they are loved and valued. Do you think that this is important to other families as well? 
Definitely. 
As Indigenous people, when we say we come from a nation, that implies a history, and connections to the land, to the territory.  There are also those collective connections, not only to our extended family, but to our communities. 
For me, the spirits of those women are helping reclaim that. That’s one of the positive messages that’s coming out of this is to honour the spirits of those women who  have sacrificed their lives., so that we can reclaim those connections with our families and communities. That’s a huge healing process for all of us. 
Looking forward, what’s the future that you want to see, that you’re working to realize for Indigenous women and girls? 
My vision is about having peaceful relationships. I just wrote about that recently. 
That’s been the role of Indigenous women all along. Inherently, we know about peace. That’s what we’ve been told as a people.  That’s one of the reasons why women are leaders in our community: because of that inherent peace that we have, to our families, to our children, and to our men. We raise our children to be peaceful people. At least, that’s what our teachings tell us.  So that’s what I want. I want to have that feeling of peace for our women, for our men, for our children, so that we feel safe in our communities and that we feel safe in society and so that we can feel safe when walking down the street. 
We’re encouraging Amnesty members to go beyond signing petitions and writing letters, to reach out directly to their Members of Parliament, through phone calls or requests for meetings, to send a message that they want real, meaningful and comprehensive action to ensure the safety of Indigenous women and girls. Is there a message that you would like see conveyed to Canadian politicians? 
You know what I think about politics. I’ve been very cynical lately about the political system, including Indigenous politics, which is why I have been focusing on communities, on the grassroots, and on healing, knowing that that is where is the change is going to come. 
I think that if I had a specific message for Members of Parliament, it would be to ask, do they know what healing from the loss of a murdered family member feels like? Do they know what it’s like to have so much trauma and loss and to try to heal from that?  I don’t think anyone wants to know what that feels like. 
I find that politics is really detached. It doesn’t make that connection to the personal. But it seems like that if you have the personal experience of what it feels like, then you’ll become the activist, that you will want to make the real changes that are needed and you will make sure that it actually happens. 
Is there work going on at the community level that gives you hope? 
Oh yes. That’s where my hope lies. Because I know that at the community level that healing is happening, and that women are taking the lead  to make things better. Again, to me, that’s that inherent responsibility, the gift that we have as women. 
The work that I have been doing in community is about empowerment and revitalization of our culture and our traditions, about understanding the historical traumas and the impact it has today, to acknowledge how it impacts today and making the necessary positive movements forward. 
In my opinion we’re on a strong healing path, stronger than any other peoples. We’ve been dealing with over 500 years of colonization, but when I think about non-Indigenous people, and those colonial descendents, they’ve never healed from their own losses and traumas, the disconnection from their own traditional territories. So I believe we’re moving a lot faster in understanding the impacts of colonization, a lot more than any other peoples. To me that’s really powerful. 
I used to feel the real heaviness because we had to deal with so much trauma. But now being in community, and seeing the changes that are happening, and our spirits that are waking up, and responding in a good way, I feel it’s amazing. 
People are taking their power back. That’s what’s really happening, not just with our women, but with our families and our Indigenous men and our lands and our territories. We’re making all those connections between being healthy people and having healthy land.

Amnesty International talked to Ellen as part of a series of conversations with activists and leaders marking the 10th anniversary of the Stolen Sisters report on violence against Indigenous women. We asked Ellen for her reflections on progress made and remaining challenges in making sure that there are No More Stolen Sisters. Here is what she had to say. 
Why do you think there has been so little coherent and concrete government response to the high levels of violence faced by Indigenous women and girls in Canada? 
Because they don’t care. It profits them to keep us oppressed and to deny that colonialism has anything to do with the whole gamut of problems we have in our communities. 
This issue of violence against Indigenous women and girls, as Amnesty’s report in 2004 stated, has colonial roots. We see the impact of Indian residential schools on the people who went there. We see the impact on the people who went to the day schools. It’s the same kind of thing, we see in the first story in the Stolen Sisters report, of Helen Betty Osborne, where it was considered par for the course for police to make racist statements like, ‘another Indian girls died, that’s just part of their sorry lives.’ 
At the end of the day it’s always about the propaganda that the Canadian government has been spewing for generations. It’s no different from when Duncan Campbell Scott and Sir John A. Macdonald thought up the whole idea of containment of Indians in the communities [through the reserve system], separated from the rest of society: it’s this whole idea that we are of lower class and lower intelligence than them. I think that’s still really prevalent in Canada. 
Why would government willing do away with all the things that have oppressed us and instead recognize our right to self-determination? It is to Canada’s advantage to be apathetic and not address the long standing historical issues. 
When we stand up for the rights of Indigenous women and girls, we’re struggling with patterns of racism, discrimination and colonialism that are, as you say, deeply rooted in Canadian society and Canadian institutions and which aren’t always clearly visible to non-Aboriginal Canadians, or are taken for granted. How do we effect the kind of change that’s needed, because clearly it’s not something that’s easily done? 
You need to educate the people who work in government, you need to educate politicians, you need to educate the public. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well Indigenous academics and activists, have all said we need Canadian society to learn about the real history of Canada, the real reasons for the oppression of Indigenous peoples – which is the land grab that has taken place – and really to teach the general population about what is going on and to change the version of history that everybody has been taught. 
Because that’s part of the propaganda machine that has been used against Indigenous peoples to continue to oppress us. It’s part of the colonial amnesia that says that the only founding people wee the English and the French and the only languages are English and French. Colonial propaganda threatens every pillar of Indigenous peoples’ identity. The only way we’re going to change that is through education. And the police among the first ones that need to be educated because there is so much systemic and institutionalized racism in how police treat Indigenous people. 
The other thing is this. Stephen Harper was really quick to blame Indigenous communities for the violence, without looking at the colonial institutions that have created this situation. But that’s not to say that we don’t need to work in our own communities. We need to work in the communities ourselves to bring back that pride in our identity, to say that violence is not part of our Indigenous culture and that this is the symptom and result of colonialism. 
Looking back over all the years that you have been standing up for the rights of Indigenous peoples, and working to advance the rights of Indigenous women in particular, do you signs of hope that this kind of change is possible and that we’re taking steps in that direction? 
Institution-wise? No, not at all. We still have the same rehash of colonial institutions without any real control by Indigenous peoples. But within the general population, yes. 
We never had Amnesty International’s help before. It’s important to see those kinds of non- governmental organizations coming forward to confront the absence of political will in Canadian society. We need the solidarity of other people living in Canadian society. I think that’s where the real change is going to come from. With climate change and threats to the environment from the dirty tar sands oil , I people are getting more and more interested in knowing about the history of Canada and collective human rights of Indigenous peoples and their individual human rights. That’s where I see hope. But as far as government and institutions go? Not at all. 
Throwing money at a problem does not make that problem better. Educating people and changing their minds is what can make a significant difference for the health and well-being and the promotion of human rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada. 
In our 2004 Stolen Sisters report when we did make the link between colonialism and violence against Indigenous women and girls, we were able to do so in part because we were able to rely in sources like the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which you mentioned, or the Manitoba Justice Inquiry which examined the murder of Helen Betty Osborne. What’s your position on the need for a national public inquiry on missing and murdered Indigenous women? 
I think it’s really important for closure for the families who are affected. We really need do something for those families. With each passing yea, that government doesn’t recognize what’s going on in society, it brings them more hurt and pain and they need to be relieved of that suffering.	But whether it’s an inquiry or some other kind of human rights tool, it needs to be led by the families. 
I was reading on article on APTN by Melina Laboucan-Massimo and she had it right on. If there’s just going to be more money placed into something without any real involvement of Indigenous peoples or any real political will, then don’t bother. 
But if it’s going to be led by the families who are directly affected, then there is the possibility of real hope and real change. If we have a national commission of inquiry or a national action plan, those things will greatly help as far as policing goes, and education of the general public. We can’t wait for government’s political will to resolve this crisis. But we do need something that is recognized and validated by general society that can support the changes we know are needed. 
To stop violence, education is needed at every level, whether its kids in elementary and high school, whether it the general pop culture which promotes violence, or whether it’s the politician or bureaucrat sitting at their desk, we need to have more understanding and awareness. 
I hope something can be done, because people are getting frustrated. 
You’ve been very active in the promotion of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. You even worked to have the Declaration translated into the Mohawk language. For you, what does the UN Declaration, and more broadly the concept of international human rights, bring to help addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls? 
Because it’s such a comprehensive human rights instrument, there are so many things within the Declaration. It recognizes the importance of Indigenous women and the fact that there is violence going on. It recognizes the historical injustices and the role of these doctrines of superiority that have been used against us in the theft of our land and resources. It can be used to restore and promote the role that Indigenous women had before the Indian Act came in, before Europeans came in, to bring back a more gender-balanced decision-making process than exists today in Canada for our people. 
The UN Declaration of course is something that I think is important  for us to use within our own societies. I think our own people often feel that human rights are only states’ obligations. But if we look at Band Councils, which are really an arm of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Canada, we need to educate them on the importance of how the Declaration, and this principle of free, prior and informed consent, are also applicable in terms of the decisions they are making on our lands and resources, and on issues like health care and education. 
It’s an important tool. As everyone has said, it’s ‘aspirational’, but so was the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which has become the norm for human rights throughout the world. I’m just hoping this will be something that I will see in my lifetime, that it becomes the norm when we’re talking about Indigenous peoples rights, whether it’s domestically, regionally, internationally, or at home in our own communities. 
Thank you very much Ellen. I always appreciate the chance to talk with you. Is there anything you’d like to add? 
I’m really grateful to Amnesty International for being an advocate that walks side by side with Indigenous women and our organizations to bring light to this problem that doesn’t seem to be improving, but seems in fact to be getting worse. I want to thank Amnesty International for the great work and support that you’ve provided for Indigenous women and our families.

In our 2004 Stolen Sisters report when we did make the link between colonialism and violence against Indigenous women and girls, we were able to do so in part because we were able to rely in sources like the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which you mentioned, or the Manitoba Justice Inquiry which examined the murder of Helen Betty Osborne. What’s your position on the need for a national public inquiry on missing and murdered Indigenous women? 
,  
I think it’s really important for closure for the families who are affected. We really need do something for those families. With each passing yea, that government doesn’t recognize what’s going on in society, it brings them more hurt and pain and they need to be relieved of that suffering. 
, 	But whether it’s an inquiry or some other kind of human rights tool, it needs to be led by the families. 
,  
I was reading on article on APTN by Melina Laboucan-Massimo and she had it right on. If there’s just going to be more money placed into something without any real involvement of Indigenous peoples or any real political will, then don’t bother. 
,  
But if it’s going to be led by the families who are directly affected, then there is the possibility of real hope and real change. If we have a national commission of inquiry or a national action plan, those things will greatly help as far as policing goes, and education of the general public. We can’t wait for government’s political will to resolve this crisis. But we do need something that is recognized and validated by general society that can support the changes we know are needed. 
,  
To stop violence, education is needed at every level, whether its kids in elementary and high school, whether it the general pop culture which promotes violence, or whether it’s the politician or bureaucrat sitting at their desk, we need to have more understanding and awareness. 
,  
I hope something can be done, because people are getting frustrated. 
,  
You’ve been very active in the promotion of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. You even worked to have the Declaration translated into the Mohawk language. For you, what does the UN Declaration, and more broadly the concept of international human rights, bring to help addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls? 
,  
Because it’s such a comprehensive human rights instrument, there are so many things within the Declaration. It recognizes the importance of Indigenous women and the fact that there is violence going on. It recognizes the historical injustices and the role of these doctrines of superiority that have been used against us in the theft of our land and resources. It can be used to restore and promote the role that Indigenous women had before the Indian Act came in, before Europeans came in, to bring back a more gender-balanced decision-making process than exists today in Canada for our people. 
,  
The UN Declaration of course is something that I think is important  for us to use within our own societies. I think our own people often feel that human rights are only states’ obligations. But if we look at Band Councils, which are really an arm of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Canada, we need to educate them on the importance of how the Declaration, and this principle of free, prior and informed consent, are also applicable in terms of the decisions they are making on our lands and resources, and on issues like health care and education. 
,  
It’s an important tool. As everyone has said, it’s ‘aspirational’, but so was the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which has become the norm for human rights throughout the world. I’m just hoping this will be something that I will see in my lifetime, that it becomes the norm when we’re talking about Indigenous peoples rights, whether it’s domestically, regionally, internationally, or at home in our own communities. 
,  
Thank you very much Ellen. I always appreciate the chance to talk with you. Is there anything you’d like to add? 
,  
I’m really grateful to Amnesty International for being an advocate that walks side by side with Indigenous women and our organizations to bring light to this problem that doesn’t seem to be improving, but seems in fact to be getting worse. I want to thank Amnesty International for the great work and support that you’ve provided for Indigenous women and our families.

Yolanda Oquelí, a leader from San Jose del Golfo in Guatemala, shared those words with me last year, describing her community’s ongoing struggle to compel the Guatemalan government to respect their rights in the context of a Canadian-initiated mining project. 
,  
Canada has a large stake in Guatemala’s mining sector, accounting for 88 per cent of all current mining operations. The country’s mining production was valued at over US $600 million in 2012. 
,  
How could anything be wrong with Canada playing such a huge role in the country’s growing mining sector, one could wonder?  It is all about human rights.

I am back in Guatemala to take part in the launch of a new Amnesty International report looking at the impacts of Guatemala’s mining sector on human rights, including the rights of Indigenous peoples.  The country’s current mining regulation falls far short of international human rights requirements and is in fact fuelling tensions between rural, mostly Indigenous, communities and mining companies by failing to ensure meaningful consultation prior to the awarding of mining licenses. In several cases mining companies have failed to adhere to international standards on business and human rights. 
,   
,  
,  
The report looks at four situations, all involving Guatemalan subsidiaries of Canadian companies: Goldcorp Inc.’s Marlin gold mine; the US/Canadian company Tahoe Resources’ Escobal silver mine; a gold deposit for which Radius Gold had an exploitation licence until selling it off to a US company in 2012; and the El Estor nickel mine which was operated by a number of Canadian companies beginning with INCO in 1965, through to HudBay Minerals and the Cyprus-based Solway Investment Group more recently. 
,  
All involve turbulent histories of inadequate or non-existent consultations, protest and conflict.  The violence will inevitably continue if a fair and reliable consultation process is not instituted in the country. 
,  
Guatemala’s Congress is currently reviewing a package of mining reforms. Unfortunately, the reforms ignore crucial issues around consultation and the rights of Indigenous peoples, the underlying causes of much of the tension and violence that surrounds Guatemala’s mining sector. 
,  
It is not too late to change that.  And Canada should play a role, pressing for mining regulations that meet international human rights standards. 
,   
,  
,  
New mining legislation must ensure full and adequate information is disclosed to potentially affected communities before mining begins.  Critically, that must include full information about possible negative, as well as positive, impacts a mine may bring.  Legal reform must also provide for meaningful consultation before mine licences are awarded and at all stages of the mining project. 
,  
Very importantly, Guatemala’s mining legislation must establish transparent, accessible and culturally appropriate procedures to guarantee Indigenous peoples their right to free, prior and informed consent, in keeping with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other international human rights instruments. 
,  
Companies do boast of corporate social responsibility initiatives in the communities where their subsidiaries operate. Certainly some community members welcome those projects.  But companies generally show much less concern about being part of meaningful consultations and complying with human rights norms than with promoting these community development projects. 
,  
In 2005, protesters blocked the Pan-American Highway for 40 days to prevent mine equipment from reaching a mine site.  A protester was shot and killed by government security forces. Then-President Oscar Berger candidly reacted by declaring that “we have to protect investors”.  Almost a decade later, it is a view point that is sadly still current. Guatemala’s weak mining regulations appear designed to serve the interests of foreign mining investors rather than upholding the rights of the country’s citizens. 
,  
The violence and repression that has taken root around mining in Guatemala cannot continue.  The key to doing so is for the Guatemalan government to adopt legislation that meets international human rights standards, such as those dealing with respect to consultation and consent. 
,  
Other governments must step up as well. Home governments of companies doing business in Guatemala must establish and implement effective regulatory frameworks for holding their companies accountable for the human rights impact of their activities. 
,  
In Canada that once again highlights the pressing need for legal reforms to adopt binding human rights standards for companies operating abroad, ensure Canadian courts are accessible to individuals who allege human rights violations associated with Canadian company operations, and establish an extractive sector ombudsperson. 
,  
I have visited with Yolanda again.  Her courage and determination has not waned. It is time now for her own government and foreign governments, certainly including Canada, to show that same commitment to human rights.

Long a significant advocate of global arms control, Canada will be conspicuously absent next year from arguably the most important conventional weapons conference of this generation. 
At a special ceremony taking place in New York today (Sept 25), diplomats will celebrate the fact that fifty countries have now ratified the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), a landmark agreement to reduce the serious harm caused by the irresponsible and illegal trade in conventional weapons, including allies like the UK, Mexico, Germany and France. Canada has yet to sign or ratify, even though Canada voted in favour of the treaty in April last year. 
Now the landmark figure of 50 has been reached – with or without Canada – the Treaty will enter into force in 90 days time and become international law. 
 
Before the end of 2015, states that are party to the Treaty will meet to establish rules and procedures for how it will operate. Unless the government signs and ratifies the ATT in the next three months, Canada will not be allowed to participate in writing the rules for its operation. While non-signatory states like Canada may be able to attend the conference as observers, they will have no say in the outcome. 
It’s hard to fathom why the government of Canada has refused (failed?)  to act on a treaty aimed at preventing weapons from falling into the hands of human rights abusers, criminals and terrorists. The treaty would prevent arms transfers for use in genocide, war crimes, and other breaches of international humanitarian law, as well as in cases where there are major risks governments would use the weapons against their own people. 
Canada’s current guidelines for the transfer of conventional weapons, including firearms, are already in line with the ATT. 
The government says it won’t sign until it is convinced the ATT will not negatively impact legal Canadian firearms owners. Our careful and honest reading of the treaty text has found absolutely nothing there that would prevent Canadians from legitimately owning firearms or that would change the obligations of current owners. The ATT focuses on irresponsible and illegitimate transfers between states, and says nothing about regulation of individual firearms ownership. 
We can only conclude that the misrepresentations of the treaty by Canadian gun lobby groups, which echo false assertions by the U.S. National Rifle Association, are deliberate obfuscations. 
Given Canada’s long experience in international arms control and national export controls, its contribution to next year’s rule-making conference would be sorely missed. 
There is yet time for Canada to rejoin its allies working to reduce and control the worldwide scourge of easy access to deadly weapons. To earn a seat at the crucial Conference of States Parties in 2015, Canada needs to sign the treaty before it enters into force at the end of this year. 
Better still, Canada could fast-track ratification of the treaty this fall and join as a full founding participant. That would provide Canada with ground-floor opportunities to ensure the treaty will work as intended to make it that much harder for human rights abusers, criminals and terrorists to get their hands on deadly weapons.

“Nearly every woman in Afghanistan has a painful story to tell,” says Dr Lima, an Afghan woman who decided to take action after witnessing harrowing cases of rape and violence against women in her country. 
Lima works to empower women who are at are at risk of human rights abuses in Afghanistan. She is a professional gynaecologist with a secret and dangerous sideline.	“When I started working, I would not help people when they came to me for an abortion. I would say no,” she says. 
It was a predictable reaction in a country where abortions are illegal in the majority of circumstances, but in 2006 Lima was confronted with a story that brought home the devastating scale of the hardships faced by Afghanistan’s women. It would change her mind on the need for access to safe abortion and would lead her to offer abortion, contraception and other forms of help to women when they found themselves with nowhere to turn. 
“The girl was 17 years old and pregnant. After her parents found out she was pregnant, they secretly gave her some medicine to weaken her – medicine that made it easier for them to suffocate her with a pillow and kill her. After that incident, I decided to help people like her,” Lima recalls. 
Lima’s decision – to start using her medical training to provide healthcare and other support to women – put her own life and her entire family’s lives in danger. She would have to work under the radar. 
“Whatever I do, I do in secret. The only person who knows is my husband,” she says.	Many of the women that Lima has provided abortions for had become pregnant as a result of rape. She has also helped women to take contraceptives secretly when their husbands were forcing them to have more children. 
She explains: “That was risky too, sometimes when women did not become pregnant for some time the husbands would ask why and may beat their wives. Then the woman would bring them to me and I would explain to the husband that because his wife had too many children without a [break], her body is now weak and it needs times to return to normal. Then the husbands would accept my [explanation] and the women could stay healthy and enjoy their lives for one or two years before they got pregnant again.” 
Lima’s mission took her to eastern Afghanistan, to a remote, poverty-stricken province on the border with Pakistan. It is a region where the influence of the Taliban is at its strongest, and respect for women’s rights is almost non-existent. 
Girls are not given access to education, husbands routinely abuse their wives and for many families the preferred response to a girl becoming pregnant outside marriage – even by rape – is to murder her and cover it up as an illness or accident. 
In some areas tribal rules dictate that if the people in the community find out that a girl is pregnant outside of marriage they will kill the girl in order to “preserve honour” and if the girl’s family resist, they too will be killed. If the rapist is identified, he and the victim will both be killed publicly. In most cases, the girls are unable to identify the rapist or he flees, leaving and the girls to pay with their lives for being the victim of a brutal crime. 
One girl in a tribal region who became pregnant as a result of being raped came to Lima to ask for an abortion. The girl told Lima that the pregnancy served as a constant reminder of her ordeal. She was also terrified she would be killed and her family would be torn apart by a “blood feud”.   
Another woman, a mother of six, was locked up with the livestock by her husband, who had married another woman. “When she came to me I helped her to get in touch with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and after many months of legal arguments she finally managed to get a divorce.” 
“No matter what a man does in these areas, he will get away with it,” says Lima.	While working in Kunar, Lima would wear a burqa to help protect her identity, but that didn’t stop the death threats from the Taliban. 
“I started to receive warning letters, saying that what I was doing was un-Islamic,” Lima says. 
In 2009, the peril of Lima’s courageous mission was brutally laid bare. 
“My son was playing in the front garden of our home in the evening. I heard an explosion and rushed outside the yard to see my son covered in blood,” she recalls. 
The 11-year-old boy had been the victim of a Taliban grenade attack to Lima’s family home. Despite suffering a debilitating leg injury, he survived and is now able to walk with the aid of a stick. 
But worse was to come six months later. 
After receiving further threats and warnings from the Taliban, Lima’s 22-year-old brother was killed in another grenade attack opposite her clinic. 
She was forced to move to a secret location, but the experience did not dent Lima’s commitment to help the women of Afghanistan. She continued to work, propelled by a sense of duty and purpose. 
“I want to serve my country and my people who have suffered a lot. I cannot just sit in the corner of my house,” she says. 
The problems faced by Afghanistan’s women are not going away; nor are the risks to Lima and her family. She says she is “more worried than ever” about her safety amid continued uncertainty, and threats to the security situation surrounding Afghanistan’s presidential elections earlier this year. 
“My son was injured and my brother was killed as a result of my work, but I have never given up. These activities cannot be done without suffering. In Afghanistan, all women are suffering.” 
Despite her own painful story Lima remains determined to continue her mission to empower and protect women in Afghanistan. 
Note: A pseudonym has been used to ensure the security of Dr Lima and her patients.

,  
What better way to spend the evening before launching our important new report, Mining in Guatemala: Rights at Risk?  Over dinner, we were able to catch up with the courageous community leader and human rights defender Yolanda Oquelí.  Yolanda has for several years been at the forefront of the campaign to ensure that mining does not go ahead in her community without consultation and consent. She has been a leader of the La Puya protest camp, which blockaded the road leading in to the mining site for over two years. 
,  
,  
Over 100,000 people have taken action, demanding protection for Yolanda Oqueli and investigations into the attack against her.

Yolanda has been targeted for her outspokenness.  In June 2012 she was shot and badly wounded by an unknown gunman.  It led the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to order Guatemalan authorities to provide protection to Yolanda and her family.  And it sparked a massive outpouring of concern and solidarity from Amnesty International members across Canada and around the world.  In Friday’s press conference we will be highlighting the fact that over 100,000 people have taken action, demanding protection for Yolanda and investigations into the attack against her. 
,  
She remains steadfast, despite the dangers that still lurk.  Over dinner she shared updates with us.  She was delighted to see the report we will be releasing.  And she expressed ongoing appreciation for the support she has received from Amnesty International members around the world.  As she put it: 
,  
“To know that with you I have family in all parts of the world gives me a force I cannot describe.”

It has been a busy week of meetings in Guatemala in advance of the report launch.  We have met with business leaders, diplomatic and government officials, civil society activists, and staff with other international organizations.  We have had frank exchanges about sometimes differing views as to the impact that the current approach to mining has on human rights protection in the country.  We’ve both agreed and disagreed about what improvements are needed to the pending reform of the country’s mining law, particularly when it comes to consultation processes with communities and Indigenous peoples; and the chances of any such improvements being adopted by the Guatemalan Congress. 
,  
Most powerful, however, have been the opportunities to meet with members of two of the communities at the frontlines of mining in Guatemala, who have been struggling for several years to be heard by government and by the mining companies that have arrived nearby. 
,  
For them it comes down to consultation, and the lack thereof to date. 
,  
And to know that Amnesty International stands with them, backing up their demand for meaningful consultation by underscoring applicable binding international human rights standards, is a source of great support.  
,  
That is what we heard from Yolanda.  We heard it from community leader Oscar Morales, when we visited him in the community of San Rafael Las Flores.  We heard it at every turn. 
,  
We have assured everyone we have met with that the launch of this report is not the end of anything, but is in fact a beginning.  Over the coming weeks and months Amnesty International activists in Canada and around the world will press the Guatemalan government to make sorely needed improvements to the proposed new mining legislation.  
,  
It is time to guarantee that mining projects in Guatemala will only go ahead on the basis of community consultations that are free of violence and coercion, take place before mining operations begin, offer sufficient time to participate and provide all necessary information in an accessible form.  It is also time to ensure full and proper respect for the vital right of Indigenous peoples to give free, prior and informed consent to mining and other development projects that have consequence for the protection of their rights. 
,  
Together with Yolanda, Oscar and so many others, we can be that force for change.

Ekaterina Khomenko’s throat was slit when a street cleaner found her in a car with the engine still running in St Petersburg earlier this month. 
According to media reports, police initially suggested – somewhat incredibly – that she might have committed suicide. An investigation is now under way into the actual cause of the 29-year-old’s death. The authorities haven’t ruled out the possibility that she may have been attacked on the basis of her sexual orientation: she was openly lesbian and gave tango lessons to same-sex couples. 
In the days before she died, a known extremist had posted hate speech and threats on a social media page she owned, in response to a photo she posted of two women embraced n the sensual Argentine dance in a St Petersburg Metro station. 
Whatever the motive, Ekaterina’s death sent a shock wave through St Petersburg’s small but active network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations. When I met some of them this week, they were visibly shaken. 
Sadly, they are used to homophobia that often boils over into aggression. And they are used to a lacklustre official response to violence against LGBT people in Russia. Crimes committed against people because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity are not covered by Russian hate crimes legislation. 
But while LGBT activists reacted to this tragedy with horror and indignation, they are resolute about continuing the struggle to foster a more inclusive climate in St Petersburg, and around Russia. They want to bring about a climate where they are empowered to live, to love, to breathe freely as themselves. 
That’s the motivation behind QueerFest, now a key annual event in St Petersburg, which kicks off today (18 September). In its sixth year, and taking place over 10 days, it will include numerous talks, seminars and performances in two venues in the city centre. 
Or at least that’s what the planners are hoping.

Last year, around 40 different venues declined to take part before the organizers finally settled on locations on the city’s outskirts. Polina Andrianova, director of “Coming Out” – the organization behind the QueerFest – told me that this year she hopes they can retain at least one of the two current venues. While the agenda and speakers have been planned for some time, given the ongoing fear and threats faced by the LGBT community, the actual locations and other details were only announced at the last minute. 
Problems lurk around every turn for the organizers of such events, and trouble often shows up uninvited. 
No fewer than five bomb threats interrupted last November’s “Side by Side” (Bok o Bok), Russia’s largest international LGBT film festival. Organizer Gulya Sultanova told me the authorities would come, sometimes in the middle of a film screening, and evacuate the entire building to search for explosives after some unidentified individual had allegedly called in a complaint. Invariably, no bombs were found, and the films resumed an hour or two after the disruption. 
“After the first time, we knew it was fake,” Gulya said. 
And there were other clear attempts to derail the festival.

Groups of young people would show up and try to gain entry, an apparent attempt to spark trouble. Participation by minors in LGBT rights-related events was among the things presumed to be outlawed in June 2013, when a “propaganda of homosexuality among minors” bill was adopted by the Duma and subsequently signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. “Presumed” to be, because nobody seems entirely sure how far such “propaganda” extends, and the law has rarely been implemented. 
But its bark has been as bad as its bite. The new law has generated additional fears and pressures for LGBT people across the country. Organizers of events like “Side by Side” and QueerFest face a threat of having to pay stiff fines unless they print “18+” age restrictions on their promotional material and ensure that no minors take part. 
According to Gulya, on one occasion, a group of young people managed to enter a screening during last year’s “Side by Side” festival, despite a passport check at the door. Once inside, they began shouting to journalists attending the screening that they were underage and were shocked by the information they were being exposed to. A vocally homophobic St Petersburg politician who was present chimed in, alleging that the LGBT organizations were forcing the youth to be there. 
Russian LGBT organizations must use age restrictions under the repressive “propaganda of homosexuality among minors” law. 
The bizarre scene soon dissipated, but some 15 minutes later, police announced a bomb threat had been called in and everyone had to be evacuated from the screening. 
Such disturbances are what “Coming Out” members are hoping to avoid during QueerFest. They are doing their utmost to ensure everything is “suitable” despite increasingly restrictive laws. Festival organizers walk a tightrope between ensuring they don’t break the law, and not wanting to send a message to the LGBTI community that they agree with what it stands for. 
“The gravest result of [the propaganda law] is it justifies a homophobic attitude and gives a green light to homophobic violence,” Polina told me. 
This is a trend she and other LGBT activists are fighting to change. 
“We are in Russia, we love our country and are working to improve it. Defence of human rights and LGBT rights helps to make Russian society better,” she said. 
The goal: a society where a film festival can be screened without bomb threats. A society where anyone is free to talk about themselves, without having it labelled as “propaganda”. A society where anyone can dance a sensual tango, with a partner of their choosing, without the fear of being attacked or killed for it. 
Despite the rapidly shrinking space for freedom of expression, many people in Russia are speaking out. Between October 6 and 12, Amnesty International activists stand with them in solidarity during a week of action to make sure Russia’s leaders know that the rest of the world will not be silent.

The disappearance of more than 270 Nigerian schoolgirls in April 2014 led to a worldwide social media campaign to #BringBackOurGirls. Tens of thousands of Amnesty International supporters signed our petition targeted at the Nigerian authorities. The world watched, and waited. Then the social media campaign faded and the issue disappeared from the headlines. Five months later the girls are still missing. And in the intervening months many more girls, boys, women, and men have been kidnapped by Boko Haram fighters. 
 
Amnesty International has called on the Nigerian government to do its utmost to safely bring back the girls. Many governments provided support to the Nigerian authorities to assist in the search. And five months later it frustratingly feels like we are no closer to finding the girls. If only finding and bringing them home was as easy as using a high tech satellite to locate them, and more high tech equipment to extract them from where they are held captive and bring them home to the open arms of their families. If only it were so simple. 
But it isn’t so simple. 
	To understand why the girls went missing and why it is so difficult to bring them home we need to look at the context in which the girls were kidnapped. There is a conflict in northeast Nigeria and it continues to escalate. Amnesty International has documented gross violations of human rights by both sides to the armed conflict—Boko Haram and the Nigerian authorities. As the conflict worsens, more people have been kidnapped by Boko Haram. Nigerian forces have been outgunned, outnumbered, and unable to stop the attacks. No one is in a rush to help better arm the Nigerian authorities to fight Boko Haram because of the widespread pattern of human rights abuses at the hands of Nigerian police and military officers. 
In March of this year Amnesty International released a report on the escalation of violence in northeast Nigeria and the rising death toll—in the first quarter of the year alone more than 1,500 people had been killed. The report highlighted the systematic pattern of rights abuses and laid out recommendations for both the Nigerian government and Boko Haram to comply with their human rights obligations. 
 
And today Amnesty International released Welcome to Hell-Fire, documenting the systematic use of torture at the hands of the police and military at detention facilities across Nigeria. Children as young as 12 have been detained and tortured; 50% of Nigerians fear they would be tortured if arrested. The situation is dire. Something needs to change. 
It is true that the schoolgirls are not home with their families, that torture is rampant, and that the scale of rights violations in Nigeria has reached crisis levels. 
But there is hope. 
Amnesty International continues to expose rights violations in Nigeria. We shine a light on detention facilities where torture is occurring in hopes that once authorities know the world is watching, the torture will stop. We take action on the cases of individuals including Moses Akatugba, who was arrested, tortured and sentenced to death… when he was only a teenager. And we continue to call on the authorities to bring back the Nigerian schoolgirls.

In addition, the report states that as of November 2013, at least 105 Indigenous women and girls remained missing under suspicious circumstances or for undetermined reasons. 
As explained below, the actual numbers may be even higher. 
These women were daughters, sisters, mothers and wives. They were loved and valued and they are missed by their families. Every missing or murdered Indigenous woman and girl is a tragedy. The combined numbers are nothing less than a national human rights crisis. 
The RCMP report does not identify how many of the perpetrators are Indigenous or non-Indigenous, but we know from individual cases that attacks on Indigenous women are carried out by Indigenous and non-Indigenous men alike. 
The vast majority of murders are committed by someone known to the victim. This is true for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women alike. 
The statistics published by the RCMP show that Indigenous women are 3.5 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be murdered by a spouse or family member and 7 times more likely to be murdered by an acquaintance. (These numbers are derived from the RCMP report but not published by the RCMP.) 
Regardless of the Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal identity of the perpetrator, or their relationship to the victim, attacks on Indigenous women take place in a social context in which discrimination, marginalization and impoverishment help put Indigenous women in harm’s way, deny Indigenous women the opportunity to escape violence, or even encourage some men to feel that they can get away with acts of violence and hatred against them. 
All of society has a responsibility to help stop this violence. 
The RCMP report shows that police deem the vast majority of murders of Indigenous and non-Indigenous women to be successfully closed. These figures may be misleading. We acknowledge that when it is clear that a murder has taken place, police in Canada generally do everything in their power to identify and build a case against whoever is responsible. In our view, the extremely high rate of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada means that police should also thoroughly investigate all suspicious deaths and disappearances, whether or not there is immediate evidence of murder.  As we highlighted in our Stolen Sisters report, there are concerns that this does not always happen. Unresolved missing persons cases and suspicious deaths are not part of the RCMP statistics on solved cases. 
On a deeper level, even when a murder has been solved, a life has still been lost and woman or girl taken from her family and community. In addition to looking at whether the perpetrators have been caught, we need to ask whether the deaths could have been prevented. 
Don’t governments in Canada already have many programs in place to address violence against Indigenous women? 
Governments are obliged to make every reasonable effort to stop violence against women. The standard is not whether governments are doing something, but whether governments are doing enough. 
Governments in Canada have taken positive steps—such as the work by the RCMP to at long last compile official statistics—the overall response has been piecemeal and inadequate. 
The scale of violence threatening Indigenous women and girls requires a comprehensive, coordinated response to ensure that they are not put at risk in the first place and to guarantee that Indigenous women and girls receive appropriate and effective help to escape violence wherever they live. 
In a series of joint states issued in advance of the annual October 4th Sisters in Spirit vigils, Amnesty International has joined with the Native Women’s Association of Canada and many others in calling for comprehensive response that would include measures such as: 
An inquiry is needed to hold government accountable for putting in place a comprehensive and coordinated and response that meets the real needs of Indigenous women and girls. An inquiry would provide an opportunity for affected families and other experts to have their voices heard. It would also allow solutions to be brought forward and considered in a non-partisan, non-political arena, facilitated by a judge or other independent expert. It has become apparent that the urgently needed comprehensive, coordinated national response may never be achieved otherwise. 
The federal Minister of Justice Peter MacKay has referred to 40 previous studies that have been carried on various aspects of Indigenous peoples’ lives in Canada. The Minister’s list includes the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, two reports on missing and murdered Indigenous women by the Native Women’s Association of Canada, as well Amnesty International’s two reports on violence and discrimination against Indigenous women in Canada, Stolen Sisters and No More Stolen Sisters. The vast majority of recommendations made in these various reports have gone unimplemented. As Amnesty International stated in an open letter to the Minister, this list of largely ignored reports is indictment of the record of successive governments to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples. It is not a justification for continued inaction. 
The United Nations has identified an obligation for every government to establish a “systemic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained” response to violence against women. This is what’s known as a national action plan. Crucial elements of a national action plan include the direct involvement of affected communities and a clear commitment to allocate appropriate financial and other resources. Canada has supported the UN resolutions calling for national action plans but has so far has made no commitment to instituting such a plan at home. The UN Secretary-General has said that all UN member states should have national action plans to stop violence against women in place by 2015. 
In its statistics on homicide, the RCMP report only includes cases where the investigating police force has concluded that a murder has taken place. The report explicitly does not include unexplained and suspicious deaths that have not yet been classified as a homicide. 
In addition, police in Canada do not consistently record the Indigenous identity of victims of crime and there is little training or support to ensure that they do so accurately. The RCMP report acknowledges the unreliability of current police practices of determining Indigenous identity. The report claims that through a file review, carried out over a period of several months, they resolved the Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal identity of most homicide victims whose identity was previously recorded as “unknown,” but that this identity remains unknown for 95 homicide victims. 
The RCMP report also does not distinguish between First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls or provide figures for homicide rates on reserve and off reserve. 
The report does not provide any information on the numbers of perpetrators responsible for each attack or the role of others in helping carry out or cover up the crime. 
The report does not include any information on how many of the women and girls previously sought help or protection from the police or service agencies or the response they received.

As the UN General Assembly began its meeting on September 16 in New York City, Amnesty International was delivering 187,563 signatures to the White House in a global call to cut off weapons fuelling abuses in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Thousands of people from the U.S. and 166 other nations are urging President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to stop arming Israel and start backing a UN arms embargo on Israel, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups. 
Though a ceasefire hangs over Israel and Gaza today, the open wounds from 50 days of conflict remain unresolved. In the Gaza Strip, at least 2,131 Palestinians were killed, including at least 1,473 civilians. Over 18,000 homes were either destroyed or damaged, and some 108,000 people were left homeless. As in other conflicts over the last seven years, war crimes were highly likely to have been committed that demand investigation. Israel hit hospitals, clinics and schools: al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah and Najjar Hospital in Rafah city, among others, were severely damaged in direct attacks or by tank shelling and missile fire. And today 450,000 people have no access to municipal water due partially to damage during the conflict. For seven years, Gaza’s people have endured an Israeli-imposed blockade forcing them into subsistence living. About 80 per cent are dependent on humanitarian aid. 
Of the 71 killed on the Israeli side six were civilians. Palestinian armed groups fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets and mortar shells on Israel from the Gaza Strip, in itself a war crime. There were reports that they fired indiscriminate rockets from near hospitals or health facilities, or used these civilian buildings for military purposes. 
Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli government continues taking Palestinian land in what amounts to war crimes, steadily appropriating more and more of their land for illegal Jewish-only settlements. Thousands of Palestinian civilians have lost homes and farmland to an ever-expanding Israeli settlement enterprise that replaces Palestinian communities with Jewish-only homes, frequently at gunpoint. 
The brutal results of Israeli practices speak for themselves. As I’ve previously written, according to the U.N., Israeli forces killed more West Bank Palestinians in 2013 than the combined totals for 2011 and 2012. Since January 2011, over 8,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 1,500 children, have been seriously injured by live ammunition fired by Israeli forces or wounded by other means. 
By continuing to provide $3 billion a year in military aid to Israel, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are helping to perpetuate this human rights crisis. For all the talk in the U.S. media of a U.S.-backed “peace process,” the reality is that the U.S. has consistently provided the kinds of weapons, ammunition and fuel that Israel has used to facilitate serious human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. These include, for example, guided missile parts, rocket launchers, artillery parts and small arms, as well as thousands of tons of fuel for fighter jets and military vehicles. Not only that, but U.S. foreign policy simultaneously shields Hamas and Palestinian armed groups from accountability as well. 
U.S. opposition to meaningful U.N. Security Council action means that the White House is shielding all of the parties from accountability for their human rights violations. The U.S. should not only be backing a U.N. arms embargo, but also supporting the referral of the situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories to the International Criminal Court. 
But the Obama Administration has done neither. As a consequence, the U.S. is shielding Israel, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups from global accountability. With U.N. Security Council authorization, the International Criminal Court could investigate, put out arrest warrants for, and even prosecute individuals suspected of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. But for the U.N. Security Council to back such a step, the U.S. must not veto the resolution. 
That’s why nearly 200,000 people from 167 countries added their names to Amnesty International’s global call. As diplomats from around the world gather in New York City, people concerned about basic human rights are demanding action. The current ceasefire should not be seen as an excuse for more of the same in U.S. foreign policy.

As the UN General Assembly began its meeting on September 16 in New York City, Amnesty International was delivering 187,563 signatures to the White House in a global call to cut off weapons fuelling abuses in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Thousands of people from the U.S. and 166 other nations are urging President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to stop arming Israel and start backing a UN arms embargo on Israel, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups. 
,  
Though a ceasefire hangs over Israel and Gaza today, the open wounds from 50 days of conflict remain unresolved. In the Gaza Strip, at least 2,131 Palestinians were killed, including at least 1,473 civilians. Over 18,000 homes were either destroyed or damaged, and some 108,000 people were left homeless. As in other conflicts over the last seven years, war crimes were highly likely to have been committed that demand investigation. Israel hit hospitals, clinics and schools: al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah and Najjar Hospital in Rafah city, among others, were severely damaged in direct attacks or by tank shelling and missile fire. And today 450,000 people have no access to municipal water due partially to damage during the conflict. For seven years, Gaza’s people have endured an Israeli-imposed blockade forcing them into subsistence living. About 80 per cent are dependent on humanitarian aid. 
,  
Of the 71 killed on the Israeli side six were civilians. Palestinian armed groups fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets and mortar shells on Israel from the Gaza Strip, in itself a war crime. There were reports that they fired indiscriminate rockets from near hospitals or health facilities, or used these civilian buildings for military purposes. 
,  
Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli government continues taking Palestinian land in what amounts to war crimes, steadily appropriating more and more of their land for illegal Jewish-only settlements. Thousands of Palestinian civilians have lost homes and farmland to an ever-expanding Israeli settlement enterprise that replaces Palestinian communities with Jewish-only homes, frequently at gunpoint.

We could not have had a more powerful affirmation of how important solidarity is in our human rights work.  
	We passed over to Claudia Medina Tamariz a collection of messages from Amnesty supporters across Canada; greeting cards, letters, handwritten notes, and drawings.  We showed her some of the colourful messages that will be among the large number of petitions and letters turned over to Mexican officials later this month.  And we unfolded a vibrant yellow banner full of handprints and a message of solidarity, from an event held in Toronto in June.	  
 
Her smile became brighter and brighter as she took it all in.  And after she’d seen the banner she told us it was so meaningful to her that she intended to hang it in her bedroom, as a reminder of the tremendous support she has in Canada.  Her words of thanks and appreciation could not have been more effusive or heartfelt.  It was clear that solidarity from Canada, and across the global Amnesty movement, fuels her determination. 	  
In turn, her gratitude and strength will now certainly inspire more activism across Canada.  It was an encounter that none of us will forget. 
	In the midst of an energetic weekend-long meeting with activists from across Mexico, we had received word that Claudia Medina had been able to travel in to Mexico City and would be able to meet with our team of five Amnesty International Canada activists and staff for an afternoon. 
  
Her demand that there be investigations and accountability for the torture she experienced has become central to our current campaign to Stop Torture, with its focus on Mexico.  What she has been through is emblematic of the crisis of torture here; where incidents of torture have increased 600% over the past decade.  
	Claudia’s determination to speak out is admirable to say the least.  Torture has been so rampant in Mexico for so many years for very many reasons.  But one is clearly to terrorize and spread fear; to keep people quiet.  She has broken through that silence, sharing widely the brutal treatment she experienced and speaking passionately about the need for justice.  Her struggle for justice is what we have in turn taken up in petitions and letter writing. 
	We met in the offices of the fabulous Mexican human rights organization, Centro Prodh.  They have provided her with legal support and have promoted her campaign for justice nationally and internationally. 
	We then continued on for a wonderful lunch at a nearby restaurant, along with two of Claudia’s teenage sons and several other relatives.  Our conversation over lunch roamed across many topics.  I particularly loved hearing about her love for cooking; including the steps involved in making corn tortillas from scratch and what goes into a truly great Mexican mole sauce.  
	And we of course came back to her case several times.  She highlighted how important it is to her that she has been able to join up with a group of other Mexican women who have been subject to torture, including rape and sexual violence.  They are campaigning together for justice and for the reforms that are needed to stop torture in Mexico, with a particular focus on the sexual violence that far too many women have experienced at the hands of Mexican police and soldiers.  
	She told me it was so important for her to join her voice with the other women who have had similar experiences because “it is not just about me; and it is not just about our group.  It is about all women in this country and it is about all Mexicans.”	  
The afternoon spent with Claudia was all about solidarity.  The importance of solidarity came through so powerfully through every encounter I’ve had over this past week in Mexico.  We campaign for concrete changes and reforms to end human rights violations, such as to prevent and stop torture in Mexico.  But we campaign also so that individuals and family members who have been through human rights violations, and are still vulnerable to ongoing threats and violence, know that they are not alone. 
	Meeting with prisoner of conscience and torture survivor Angel Colón in a prison outside Tepic.  Meeting with Adrian Vazquez, who nearly died from the torture he experienced, and is still held in a prison near Tecate.  Meeting in Tijuana with former prisoners and family members of current prisoners, all of whom have been tortured.  Meeting in Mexico City with the family of Héctor Rangel Ortiz, who have courageously campaigned for answers about the fate of their son and brother, who was disappeared five years ago.  Hearing at the activism meeting from Paraguayan Indigenous leader Leonardo González about the role Amnesty International played in supporting his people in their struggle to regain their land.

These days there are no visitors heading to the ancient Iraqi city of Samarra, 120km north of Baghdad, to admire its archaeological treasures. 
The city, once the capital of the powerful Abbasid Empire, which spread from Tunisia to Central Asia, is also home to the iconic golden-domed al-Askari shrine, a Shi’a holy site that was bombed by Sunni militants in 2006, unleashing a vicious cycle of sectarian attacks and counter-attacks across Iraq. 
As we head north of Baghdad, after days searching for anyone willing to drive me to Samarra, the road becomes eerily empty and the checkpoints more frequent. I lose count but make a point of counting them on the way back, when we are stopped 35 times and pass through another half a dozen roadblocks manned by a combination of government forces and Shi’a militias. They are wearing a variety of uniforms and head-bands bearing insignias and flying flags of this or that militia. The once busy shops and restaurants which line both sides of the road have been looted and trashed, some have been burned down. The houses lie abandoned, some used as military positions by the army or militias. 
In the city, home to some 400,000 Sunni Muslims, fear and tension are palpable. 
Residents are still reeling from a killing spree that took place in Hay al-Dhubbat, a neighbourhood in the east of the city in June. The attacks were seemingly in revenge for an incursion into the city by fighters of the Islamic State (IS or ISIS) a day earlier.   
Scores of others have been abducted since then.  Some were later found dead, the rest have vanished and are feared dead too. 
I meet family after family whose relatives have been murdered or abducted and not heard of since.  Khadija* tells me her 22-year-old son was taken from his bed by armed men in military uniforms on the morning of 6 June. He was found dead nearby the following morning. 
“The militias broke into our home as we were sleeping. They grabbed my son from his bed and took him outside where more armed men and three black Hummers (vehicles) were waiting. I tried to follow them but they shot in my direction. They also took our neighbour’s son.  We looked for them everywhere until the following day we were told their bodies had been found in a mosque nearby.  My son had been shot twice in the head and once in the chest,” she says. 
Ali* tells me his two brothers, aged 20 and 22, were seized from their aunt’s house that same morning. Their bodies were found on a nearby building site a few hours later. Both had been shot in the head. He says that armed men in black uniforms had checked the family ration card and presumed the brothers were hiding at their aunt’s home. In fact they had just spent the night there as they often did when they visited and stayed up late talking. 
On the same day dozens of young men suffered a similar fate. 
In one house I find four women who live in fear of a knock on the door bringing news that their abducted relatives are dead. Aziza* says her husband and his brother were taken on 12 July at a checkpoint run by the Sarayat al-Salam (Peace Brigade), a militia of the Shi’a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr north of the city. The family had been fleeing Tikrit which is under IS control. 
“We decided to move here because of the fighting in Tikrit. At the checkpoint they took my husband and his brother and the car.  Since then we have received no news.  All our possessions and documents were in the car. We are now destitute and don’t even have our IDs to prove who we are,” she says. 
Some of those who were abducted were killed, even after their families paid hefty ransoms. The brother of a 39-year-old father of four, who was abducted on 26 July while on his way from Samarra to Baghdad, told me that after the family paid the ransom his brother failed to return.  His body was later found in Baghdad. He had been shot three times in the head. The ransom handover took place in a Shi’a area of Baghdad, a sign that the likely culprits are one of the many Shi’a militias operating in the area.   
Samarra has been under lockdown since the IS incursion into the city at the beginning of June when the group also gained control of large areas of northern Iraq.  Residents told me they feel powerless as they are trapped between the two sides; the Islamic State controls areas to the north of Samarra while government forces and Shi’a militias control areas to the south. The two sides often clash in areas surrounding the city. 
“We are cut off from everything, the only road open is south to Baghdad but many of the checkpoints are controlled by Sh’ia militias who abduct Sunnis so most people avoid getting on the road. Trade and business in general has all but stopped. Young people especially are left with little to do and this is dangerous as some may turn to IS out of frustration,” an elderly resident told me.   
As well as the Shi’a militas, residents are right to be worried about the threat posed by IS fighters. As I left Samarra news came through that the group is threatening to behead an Iraqi journalist they had abducted in the area last week. 
The arrogant and menacing attitude of some of the Shi’a militias I observed at the checkpoints on the journey back to Baghdad is certain to fuel the resentment of Samarra’s largely Sunni population. This is compounded by a strong desire for revenge by those who have lost relatives at the hands of these militias.  Unless the new Iraqi government reins in these all-powerful militias the vicious cycle of sectarian violence is only likely to get worse.

Ten years ago, when Amnesty International released its first research report on missing and murdered Indigenous women, we did not call for a national inquiry. 
At the time, we felt that the most, if not all, the elements of what government needed to do to address the threats to Indigenous women’s lives had already been identified by frontline service providers, affected families and communities, and previous inquiries. Then, as now, what was urgently needed was the political will to consolidate all these measures into a comprehensive, coordinated national action plan.	Ten years have now passed since that initial report. And despite the unprecedented public attention to the issue, and the fact that murders and disappearances continue to steal Indigenous women and girls from their families and communities, Canada still does not have a plan to stem this violence. 
Instead of a comprehensive and coordinated national action plan, government response remains piecemeal and scattershot. The voices of affected families and communities have been ignored in two separate Parliamentary committee hearings which served only to endorse current government policies.

,  
Ten years ago, when Amnesty International released its first research report on missing and murdered Indigenous women, we did not call for a national inquiry. 
,  
At the time, we felt that the most, if not all, the elements of what government needed to do to address the threats to Indigenous women’s lives had already been identified by frontline service providers, affected families and communities, and previous inquiries. Then, as now, what was urgently needed was the political will to consolidate all these measures into a comprehensive, coordinated national action plan. 
, 	Ten years have now passed since that initial report. And despite the unprecedented public attention to the issue, and the fact that murders and disappearances continue to steal Indigenous women and girls from their families and communities, Canada still does not have a plan to stem this violence. 
,  
Instead of a comprehensive and coordinated national action plan, government response remains piecemeal and scattershot. The voices of affected families and communities have been ignored in two separate Parliamentary committee hearings which served only to endorse current government policies. Government officials continue to make statements that simplify and distort the issues, ignoring the evidence that violence is pervasive and fueled by discrimination and impoverishment.

It has become apparent that the urgently needed comprehensive, coordinated national response may never be put in place unless there is greater government accountability to the families of missing and murdered women and to all Canadians.

When Shappal Ibrahim, a peaceful activist with the Union of Young Kurds, was approached by a Syrian government official claiming to be a fellow supporter of the country’s “revolution”, he did not realize it was part of a ploy to detain him for his human rights activities. After agreeing to meet the official on 22 September 2011, he was driven away and detained in the city of Qamishli, his hometown. He was held in secret for nearly two years, one of Syria’s many “disappeared” before he was released as part of a presidential amnesty on 29 May 2013. It was only then he learned that on 5 September 2012 a court had sentenced him to 15 years in prison. Here, he tells his story of how he was treated in some of Syria’s many detention centres. 
 
They beat us and insulted us when we entered the detention facility at one of the Damascus branches of Air Force Intelligence. We were beaten for hours and then thrown into jail – 13 men in a 2×2 metre cell. We had to take turns to sit down. 
One by one, the detainees were called and taken to the interrogation room. Their screams filled the corridors as they were tortured.  People would come back wrapped in blankets stained with their blood. 
They beat me with a cable and electrocuted me on my feet. They would not ask me anything specific; they just accused and insulted me, then they hit me in the face. They wanted me to sign a confession. 
There was very little water and food available and we were only allowed to sleep when the prison guards allowed us to. 
We were then transferred to another place in Bab Touma – which is also connected to Air Force Intelligence – and three months later to Saydnaya Military Prison near Damascus. 
There, they had a system to break us down. 
Food was so inadequate we were always hungry and they gave us only a few clothes even though the temperature was extremely cold. 
They called me in for questioning many times and the torture was never-ending. 
They would ask me to take off my clothes and then sprayed cold water on my body. Then the interrogator would walk on my body and hit me on my back and my feet. 
In those difficult moments I was thinking of my three children, my wife, my parents, my friends and the revolutionary movement. 
Despite my pains, wounds, illnesses and being cut off from my family, I could still feel the revolution within me and the enthusiasm ignite me again. The principles that brought me to that place are the same that caused me to feel hope and defiance and to not to give up. 
In the year and eight months I was detained, I was only allowed one visit, 22 days before my release. 
My younger brother Joan was able to see me for six minutes. 
Then on 29 May 2013, one of the guards came to our cell and told me I would be released. I didn’t believe him, I thought I was going to be executed. The guards shaved my hair off and I was sure I was going to die. But then they just gave me my things and released me. I didn’t know why, I felt sheer disbelief. 
When I arrived in my hometown Qamishli, many people were waiting for me. My friends carried me on their shoulders, they had prepared a reception where I gave a speech to the crowd. It was a moment of great significance to me. I felt like I was born again, and embraced my children and family and was filled with tears of joy. 
I felt a great responsibility towards what I saw, and gathered my strength again, and promised myself that I’d dedicate my whole life so as not to let down my people. 
Information was leaked to Syrian security once again of my continued activities so they sent me a threat, which prompted my family and my friends to request that I leave Syria. 
I remain indebted to my friends and family for their tireless solidarity; they continued to push for my release, organize demonstrations to ensure my case was not forgotten.

Torture is endemic in the Philippines. Police officers in the Philippines tortured Jerryme Corre, a bus driver, in what could be a case of mistaken identity. Jerryme is still in prison awaiting justice. Alfreda Disbarro was arrested and tortured while in custody at a police station. Her torturers have yet to be held to account. And earlier this year, a “wheel of torture” was discovered at a detention facility in the Philippines. Detainees were forced to spin the wheel, and whatever form of torture the arrow landed on was inflicted on them. 
How has torture become so widespread in the Philippines? Because authorities have turned a blind eye and allowed it to become endemic. But two recent events provide hope that things can change.	  
Amnesty began campaigning in support of Alfreda Disbarro in May. We called for an investigation into her allegations of torture. Because of letters received by officials from Amnesty members, an investigation into her torture has now been opened. This is clear proof that our campaigning to shine a light on cases of torture is having an impact! 
More good news came on August 12, 2014 when retired Major General Jovito Palparan, also known as “Berugo” (“the executioner” or “the butcher”) was arrested. He is accused of kidnapping, illegally detaining, and torturing university students in 2006. The general’s arrest sends a strong signal to other law enforcement officials that they are on notice—that torture will no longer be tolerated. 
One arrest is not enough but it is a step in the right direction. The general’s arrest must be followed by a fair trial. There must be independent and impartial investigations into other allegations of torture, followed by further arrests and convictions. 
As said by Rupert Abbott, Amnesty’s Deputy Asia-Pacific Director, “the time has come to break down the wall of impunity, brick by brick.”

, 	The images are haunting. The message shocking. “Am I next?” 
,  
, 	Holly Jarrett, cousin of Loretta Saunders, an Inuk woman murdered in Halifax, NS in February, launched the “Am I next?” social media campaign on Saturday, September 6. It plays on the word “ain,” a term of endearment in her native Inuktituk. Given the alarmingly high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada, it is meant to draw attention to a question that Indigenous women and girls have to ask themselves—will they be the next to vanish? 
,  
Within hours of launching the campaign, Indigenous women from across the country were uploading “selfies” with handmade signs asking the federal government, “Am I next?” In a matter of days, thousands of people had joined the Facebook group where the photos continue to pour in every hour, many of them accompanied with messages to the federal calling for action to stop the violence. 
,  
As I view the thousands of photos I can’t help but think, “please not you, and not you, and not you.” I don’t want any of these strong and beautiful sisters, daughters, aunties, mothers, and grandmothers to be next. None of us should be next. We shouldn’t even have to worry about being next. But given that Indigenous women and girls are 4.5 times more likely to be murdered than non-Indigenous women in Canada, one of these women or girls may very well be next. 
,  
What can you do? View the “Am I next?” photos. Stand in solidarity with your Indigenous sisters by sharing the photos on your social media feeds.

by Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada (English branch)– September 8, 2014, from Guadalajara, Mexico 
UPDATE: Ángel Colon was released in October 2014! He’s now struggling for justice in his case and speaking out against torture in Mexico. Take Action >> Stand with Angel.   
It had been a two and a half hour drive from Guadalajara. As we approached, the ominously named prison, CEFERESO Number 4, the Federal Centre for Social Rehabilitation, loomed large and intimidating at the bottom of one last hill. 
We spent the next hour going through the most extensive series of endless security checks I’ve been through in any prison visit, anywhere. It included a stamp on our forearms which only showed up under a special light, which we had to show again on our way out to demonstrate that none of us had stayed behind and allowed a prisoner to slip out in our place. There was, in fact, far more visible security than I have experienced on any of the visits I’ve made to the US detention centre at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. 
 
All of this, you would think, must mean that our Amnesty team was heading in to see a notorious terrorism suspect, drug cartel kingpin, or feared organized crime boss. 
Not at all. We were there to interview Ángel Amilcar Colón Quevedo, a human rights activist who has endured torture, racial discrimination and a profoundly unfair legal process for more than five years. That such a man, having been through such a range of serious human rights violations, is locked up in such a foreboding and harsh place adds one more particularly cruel dimension to the injustices he has suffered. 
Ángel, an eloquent man who exuded nothing but grace, dignity and an inspiring commitment to justice, told us about his work and travels, defending the rights of his Afro-descended Garífuna community and speaking out about environmental issues. In early 2009 he was faced with an immense personal tragedy. One of his two young sons was sick with cancer and he needed much more money than he could earn in Honduras if we was to afford the treatments that might save his life. Like so many hundreds of thousands of other Central Americans, therefore, he set off on the migrant’s journey, through Mexico to the US border, intending to cross over and find work to earn the money his family so desperately needed. 
But it went terribly wrong. The house where he was waiting in Tijuana was raided by local state police. He fled but was arrested nearby. 
And the torture began. 
He was hit repeatedly in the ribs, made to walk on his knees, kicked and punched in the stomach. He was blindfolded and transferred to a military base where he heard the screams of others being tortured. 
A plastic bag was forced over his head to make him feel like he was being smothered. He was stripped and made to lick the shoes of other prisoners. Racial insults were hurled at him repeatedly. After 16 hours of this he was coerced into making a statement, which led to him being charged with membership in a criminal gang. Even though he repudiated that statement when he later appeared before a judge and described how he had been tortured, the statement is still part of his file and no investigation has been carried out. 
Only this year, five years after going through this ordeal, was he finally examined by independent medical experts, who confirmed he had almost certainly been tortured. Yet still he is behind bars. 
  
Our visit began by sharing with him the immense outpouring of activism there has been and will be on his behalf, in Mexico and around the world. We were able to show him pages filled with messages of solidarity from over 2,000 individuals, gathered by Amnesty’s Mexican section. Tears immediately filled his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. He was obviously deeply moved to hear that so many people, in so many parts of the world, were aware, concerned and taking action to secure his freedom. 
He shared the profound sadness he felt when he learned that his son had died from cancer only a few months after he left Honduras, and the pain of being separated for so long from his wife and his other son, who was only two years old when he left. 
But he still hopes there will be justice. “What I would like now is for the people who committed these acts to be brought to justice. That they face justice and that justice does what it needs to do. So that these things do not happen again. That what happened to me does not happen to other people.” 
He was grateful to those who have taken action on his case and other cases.  And he spoke from his heart urging that all people who have been in solidarity with him and who stand against torture “not let down their guard.”  As he noted, “torture has no color, no race, no distinctions of any kind.  It can be anyone.  It destroys.  It destroys life.  It destroys the individual.”  
And he spoke about torture. “Torture has no color, no race, no distinctions of any kind,” he told us, “It can be anyone. It destroys. It destroys life. It destroys the individual.” 
There were warm, strong embraces all round as our visit came to an end. It felt like close friends were parting ways; but parting ways knowing that we would meet again. Every one of us left CEFERESO Number 4 with a strong determination to do everything we can over the coming weeks to draw even more attention and generate more pressure on Mexican authorities. The decision expected in mid-October about this case offers a critical window of time in which to make a difference. 
Ángel is confident his freedom draws near. “Now is the time that I want to be given my freedom,” he told us. His confidence must become our confidence. His determination must become ours.

That such a man, having been through such a range of serious human rights violations, is locked up in such a foreboding and harsh place adds one more particularly cruel dimension to the injustices he has suffered. 
,  
Ángel, an eloquent man who exuded nothing but grace, dignity and an inspiring commitment to justice, told us about his work and travels, defending the rights of his Afro-descended Garífuna community and speaking out about environmental issues. In early 2009 he was faced with an immense personal tragedy. One of his two young sons was sick with cancer and he needed much more money than he could earn in Honduras if we was to afford the treatments that might save his life. Like so many hundreds of thousands of other Central Americans, therefore, he set off on the migrant’s journey, through Mexico to the US border, intending to cross over and find work to earn the money his family so desperately needed. 
,  
But it went terribly wrong. The house where he was waiting in Tijuana was raided by local state police. He fled but was arrested nearby. 
,  
And the torture began. 
,  
He was hit repeatedly in the ribs, made to walk on his knees, kicked and punched in the stomach. He was blindfolded and transferred to a military base where he heard the screams of others being tortured. 
,  
A plastic bag was forced over his head to make him feel like he was being smothered. He was stripped and made to lick the shoes of other prisoners. Racial insults were hurled at him repeatedly. After 16 hours of this he was coerced into making a statement, which led to him being charged with membership in a criminal gang. Even though he repudiated that statement when he later appeared before a judge and described how he had been tortured, the statement is still part of his file and no investigation has been carried out. 
,  
Only this year, five years after going through this ordeal, was he finally examined by independent medical experts, who confirmed he had almost certainly been tortured. Yet still he is behind bars. 
,  
  
,  
,  
Our visit began by sharing with him the immense outpouring of activism there has been and will be on his behalf, in Mexico and around the world. We were able to show him pages filled with messages of solidarity from over 2,000 individuals, gathered by Amnesty’s Mexican section. Tears immediately filled his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. He was obviously deeply moved to hear that so many people, in so many parts of the world, were aware, concerned and taking action to secure his freedom. 
,  
He shared the profound sadness he felt when he learned that his son had died from cancer only a few months after he left Honduras, and the pain of being separated for so long from his wife and his other son, who was only two years old when he left. 
,  
But he still hopes there will be justice. “What I would like now is for the people who committed these acts to be brought to justice. That they face justice and that justice does what it needs to do. So that these things do not happen again. That what happened to me does not happen to other people.” 
,  
He was grateful to those who have taken action on his case and other cases.  And he spoke from his heart urging that all people who have been in solidarity with him and who stand against torture “not let down their guard.”  As he noted, “torture has no color, no race, no distinctions of any kind.  It can be anyone.  It destroys.  It destroys life.  It destroys the individual.”  
,  
And he spoke about torture. “Torture has no color, no race, no distinctions of any kind,” he told us, “It can be anyone. It destroys. It destroys life. It destroys the individual.” 
,  
There were warm, strong embraces all round as our visit came to an end. It felt like close friends were parting ways; but parting ways knowing that we would meet again. Every one of us left CEFERESO Number 4 with a strong determination to do everything we can over the coming weeks to draw even more attention and generate more pressure on Mexican authorities. The decision expected in mid-October about this case offers a critical window of time in which to make a difference. 
,  
Ángel is confident his freedom draws near. “Now is the time that I want to be given my freedom,” he told us. His confidence must become our confidence. His determination must become ours.

	Everywhere in northern Iraq thousands of people driven from their homes by the conflict are now struggling to survive in grim conditions. As winter approaches it can only get worse. 
Near Derabon, close to the Turkish and Syrian borders, a group of displaced families have simply found a patch of open ground beside roads and built the most basic shelters out of wood and straw. They get water – which they say is barely drinkable – from a spring about half a mile away and they are without any kind of power. 
 
 
While we are there, a truck arrives and hands out donated mattresses, but there are not enough to go around. A group of children fight over the last mattress; it ends in tears for those who will spend another night on hard ground. Many of the children have no shoes and the adults ask us to take photos of the swollen, broken, hard skin on their feet, to show the world what they are experiencing. 
This scene offers just a small snapshot of the hardships thousands are now being forced to endure. 
Such was the speed and magnitude of the movement of people after the Islamic State (IS) entered Sinjar in early August that within days hundreds of thousands of people – mostly from the minority Yezidi community – fled across the Syrian border and back into northern Iraq. A month later there is still nowhere near enough accommodation for them, let alone basic services. Those camps that have been built are full. For those sheltering in schools, half-finished buildings or in the open, living conditions can be quite brutal. 
In Khanke, a small town not far from the frontline, 91 people internally displaced by the conflict are crammed into an unfinished concrete building on a busy shopping street. The deep shock of being suddenly and violently ejected from their home towns is palpable. One man sits against the wall, unable to speak, apparently as a result of his traumatic experience. 
The owner of the building says he is allowing them to use the space because he is appalled and moved by their situation. The onset of winter in just a couple of months is at the top of everybody’s minds. 
“It gets below freezing in winter and there is no wall to stop the cold coming into this place. I am very worried about their children getting ill if they stay here,” he said. 
After a slow start, new camps are now being built, by the UN and the regional government, to try to avoid a further catastrophe as the colder months arrive; but it appears that the 129,000 people living in Dohuk’s schools are likely to be the first to move into these, so that the school term can begin for the region’s children. 
Iraq’s displacement crisis, which has got progressively more severe throughout 2014 as conflict raged in Anbar, Mosul and Sinjar, has affected people from almost all Iraq’s ethnic and religious communities – among the most profoundly affected are the Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shi’a, Shabak Shi’a, members of the Yezidi faith, Kakai and Sabean Mandaeans. There are around 1.5 million displaced people across the country, leaving humanitarian organizations stretched and struggling to get support to those in areas considered too dangerous for staff to travel to. 
Frustration and confusion at why the help is not coming faster is everywhere. A group of displaced Christians staying in the grounds of one of Erbil’s churches have been visited by foreign dignitaries including the French Foreign Minister, but despite this attention, they still only have intermittent water, and are sleeping up to 60 people in a tent. 
While the world focuses on how to deal with the threat of IS, people displaced by the conflict wonder what their choices are for the future. No-one expects a quick end to the fighting, but in any case many people are convinced that even if IS is forced out of their towns eventually, they will never be able to return to their homes. Their trust that Iraqi or Kurdish forces will protect them from future attacks has, they say, been shattered. 
Many say they want to leave Iraq and find another country to live in. A well-educated father of three staying in the town of Sharia says he is thinking of taking his family to Turkey, to attempt to cross the border illegally into Greece and the EU. We explain how dangerous this crossing is, and how it might not bring a better life for his family. But he wonders what other options he has: 
“What else can we do? We can’t go home, we know that no-one will protect us. And there is not much hope here. My wife is nine months pregnant, so I am thinking that we should go a few weeks after the baby is born, so that we can cross the mountains before the winter comes.”

There is a small but amazing group of dedicated Amnesty International fundraisers entrenched within the Anglican Sisterhood of St. John the Divine (SSJD).  
From August 1989 to June 2014, the Sisters have made and sold one thousand, eight hundred and eleven (1,811) knitted and stuffed Teddy Bears!  The Sisters have garnered almost $15,000, which, with the exception of a deduction for the cost of stuffing material, has been entirely given to the work of Amnesty International. 
The Sisterhood of St. John the Divine is a contemporary expression of the religious life in the Anglican Church. Founded in Toronto in 1884, they are a prayer and action-oriented monastic community, grounded and rooted in obedience to the Two Great Commandments – to love God and to love one’s neighbour. 
The Sisters became interested in the work of Amnesty International in 1989 through the efforts of Joan Francis, one of their Associates.  Joan, known as the Amnesty “Teddy Bear Lady”, was a long-time AI activist, who passed away on September 3, 2014.  Until the age of 97, Joan knit Teddy Bears for Amnesty International and signed Amnesty petitions and postcards for Group 65! 
In the 1980s, Joan was sending Urgent Action telegrams on behalf of individuals suffering from persecution and other human rights abuses.  The sale of bears provided Joan with the funds to send the telegrams. Inspired by Joan’s “Teddies for Tellies” project, a number of Sisters decided to use some of their recreation time to make Teddy Bears for Amnesty International.  
At first, the proceeds were given to Joan to help her pay for telegrams.  For a period of time in the 1990s, the money was given to AI Group 3 to help with the cost of postage on behalf of Urgent Actions and Prisoners of Conscience.  After the closure of Group 3, the money was sent directly to Amnesty International in Ottawa. 
The SSJD Motherhouse is located in North Toronto, adjacent to St. John’s Rehab Hospital which was founded by the Sisterhood in 1937.	  
When you walk between the Convent Guest House and the Refectory you will pass numerous bookshelves filled with a tempting array of spiritual books for sale.  There, in the midst, is a special table dedicated solely to the work of Amnesty International.   
Along with pamphlets, postcards and a description of Amnesty’s work, you will usually find 3 or 4 adorable, hand-knitted Teddy Bears for sale.  Attached to the arm of every Teddy Bear is a neatly laminated tag: “My name is Mortimer [or Pumpkin, or Sniffles, or Toby] and I work for AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL”.  How many children and adults have been introduced to Amnesty International through these soft, cuddly Teddy Bears? 
The name and sale of every Teddy Bear is carefully documented in a special ledger.  Sister Wilma, the keeper of the Teddy Bear book, loves to tell about the many sisters, associates and friends over the years who contributed to the making of the bears.   
Sister Wilma reports that the wool is almost entirely given to them by Associates and friends from left-overs from their own various projects. In recent years, an Associate of SSJD has donated teddy bears made from her original Girl Guide pattern.  The Sisters have also welcomed a number of smaller bears from a Craft Group at a nearby Church. Sometimes, volunteers will deliver a bundle of knitted “bear skins”. Over time, the Sisters stitch the individual “bear skins” together, stuff them and, with much laughter and delight, add the facial features and select a name. “The most important thing we do, of course, is to pray regularly for the work of Amnesty International which we do most days.” 
After the bears are named, they are sold at the Convent, and the proceeds from the bears are sent directly to Amnesty International  Canada’s head office in Ottawa. 
Supporters of Amnesty International are aware of the powerful potential of many tiny candles flickering in the darkness. For twenty-five years, thousands of prayers and tiny stitches have had their own immeasurable impact!

Joan first became involved in Amnesty International in the early 1970s, when she joined Group 3 in Toronto. The Toronto Office has an Accounts book that records Joan’s membership in 1973. She was quite bewildered by the first meeting but stuck with it and, as she said, “the rest is history“. 
,  
At some point in the late 70s, a young man made a teddy bear pattern with seniors in mind. He though kitting bears for their grandchildren might help to fill their days. A friend of Joan’s came across the pattern in a story, bought it, and shared her excitement with Joan. 
,  
Wallis was the first teddy. “He was a peculiar-looking bear, ” Joan recalls. “I forgot to make his body, and simply attached his legs to his head!”  She fixed him up and sold him for $5. The money paid for a telegram in response to an Urgent Action. 
,  
More bears followed – Darcy, Turtle, Tulip, Pansy, Hamish, Jasper … “I try to choose names that little people can understand.” These joined the Teddies for Telegrams club. 
,  
  
,  
,  
Each continues to support Amnesty International’s work. The latest is Robin. Have any been named Joan? “No!” she exclaimed vehemently. Is she still knitting?  “Of course!” And then admitted “It’s almost like an addiction, you know.” 
,  
The price of the bears has climbed from $5 in the 70s to $8 in the 80s and to $10 in the 90s. There it has stayed. 
,  
Perhaps most special of all is the bear in the custody of Dita Sari. The trade union leader attended an annual meeting after she was released from prison in Indonesia. A delegate bought the bear and presented it into Dita Sari’s arms as a tangible message that Amnesty International stood by here, and continues to do so. “I think about the prisoners, you know,” said Joan. “Every time I knit one I think of someone in prison“.

She is proud of her bears. “All the material is made in Canada“, she crowed. “And I always buy new yarn and new stuffing for them. There’s nothing harmful about them, so even little ones can enjoy them.” 
,

,  
The cost of yarn, stuffing and bags over the years must be quite high. Joan has a friend who shakes a finger a her, encouraging her to keep a few dollars from each sale to cover costs. “But you know, if I take money back, then the whole project has no meaning for me”, she mused. “It’s my offering.”

 This summer’s conflict in Gaza and southern Israel was wrenching. Day after day it did not let up. Rockets launched from Gaza. Relentless aerial bombardment by Israeli forces in Gaza. More rockets from Gaza. Missiles and ground assaults by Israeli forces. All of that in a wider context of serious and longstanding human rights violations, including the collective punishment of the Gaza blockade; and very legitimate security concerns. Against this loud and angry backdrop the toll on civilians, overwhelmingly Palestinian civilians, was heartbreaking. In a corner of the world that has been enmeshed in decades of repression, terrorism, reprisal, defence and revenge the summer of 2014 will long be remembered for the scale and ferocity of the violence. 
 
	The human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law have been relentless. Without a doubt, both sides have committed war crimes and/or crimes against humanity. 
	At such a time, faced with such a crisis, it is vitally important that the international community consistently and forcefully reject violations on both sides and demand that both sides comply with international law. When it comes to picking a side it should be clear; the only side to choose is human rights protection. Neither side’s population’s human rights matter more than the other’s. 
	That should be an easy calculation for Canada. But not this time out. In fact, Canada’s position could not have been more contrary to that imperative.	At every turn the Canadian government has steadfastly refused to criticize Israeli actions – even mildly. No matter the circumstances. No matter the nature of the attack. Blame was always directed back to Hamas. A hospital or a UN school is hit by Israeli bombs and it is Hamas’ fault. The argument goes something like this: if Hamas was not launching rockets, Israel would not have to respond and the unlawful attack would not have happened. 
	But that is not what international law says; not international humanitarian law and not international human rights law. Instead international law operates in accordance with that age-old playground maxim: two wrongs do not make a right. In the face of accusations of war crimes or crimes against humanity it is simply no excuse or defence to say, but the other guys did it first. Where and when would that ever end? Self-defence; yes, of course. But in accordance with international law. And certainly not by means of war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
	The Canadian government and numerous commentators have harshly criticized human rights groups like Amnesty International and others who insist on condemning all violations and abuses, by both sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The current fashion is to accuse us of engaging in ‘moral relativism’. By criticizing Israeli forces for violating international law we are apparently implicitly equating them to Hamas, who we also condemn for violating international law. And that somehow means that we are saying both sides are equally bad. 
	Prime Minister Harper sharply rebuked those who criticize Israel’s human rights record in his speech to the Israeli Knesset in January of this year, essentially labelling us moral relativists who ‘go along to get along’. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird made it clear in a speech to the American Jewish Congress in Washington back in May that when it comes to Canadian foreign policy with respect to Israel, “there is no room for moral relativism”. In a statement issued on 15 July of this year, responding to the Gaza crisis, Minister Baird insisted that, “the scourge of terrorism must be wholly rejected by all peace-loving people around the world. We must never allow moral relativism to act as cover for the indiscriminate attacks on Israel we have seen over the past eight days.” 
	Using outraged and lecturing rhetoric about moral relativism to deflect criticism of Israel completely misses what international human rights and humanitarian laws are all about. International law is never about assigning equal or equivalent blame between parties to a conflict or among countries. It is about blame, not about equivalency. If one side violates rights, that is wrong and blameworthy and should be stopped and remedied. If the other side violates rights, that is wrong and blameworthy and should be stopped and remedied. International human rights and humanitarian norms do not assess the good guys versus the bad and let the good guys off the hook when they break the law. That is politics, not law. 
	Amnesty International is pressed repeatedly by governments, reporters and others to do just that; to engage in equivalency. We are asked to rank and compare all the time. Which side is worse? How does country X compare to country Y? Are things better or worse in country Z this year? 
	And we refuse to do so. We refuse because that is not what universal human rights protection strives to achieve. It is not only about protecting rights against violations by whichever fighting force has the worst record. We are not only concerned about and ready to condemn the human rights records of the top twenty violating nations. And we do not excuse violations when committed by a democratically elected government. It is about protecting rights. Everyone’s. Everywhere. End of story. 
	That is what has been sold so grievously short amidst Canada’s hectoring and posturing throughout this summer’s Gaza/Israel crisis. Behind the defiant insistence that Canada will not engage in moral relativism, and thus not criticize Israel, is this implicit, chilling message: some people’s rights matter much more than others. 
	That is not in the interests of Palestinians, obviously. Nor Israelis. And for a country that believes in and strives towards universal human rights protection, it is not in the interests of Canadians. 
	It is time to take arguments about moral relativism out of Canadian foreign policy, particularly with respect to Israel. What Palestinians need, what Israelis need and what the world needs to hear from Canada is a principled, consistent defence of all human rights. It doesn’t get any more moral than that. And there is nothing relative about it.

When it comes to picking a side it should be clear; the only side to choose is human rights protection. Neither side’s population’s human rights matter more than the other’s. 
,  
	That should be an easy calculation for Canada. But not this time out. In fact, Canada’s position could not have been more contrary to that imperative. 
, 	At every turn the Canadian government has steadfastly refused to criticize Israeli actions – even mildly. No matter the circumstances. No matter the nature of the attack. Blame was always directed back to Hamas. A hospital or a UN school is hit by Israeli bombs and it is Hamas’ fault. The argument goes something like this: if Hamas was not launching rockets, Israel would not have to respond and the unlawful attack would not have happened. 
,  
	But that is not what international law says; not international humanitarian law and not international human rights law. Instead international law operates in accordance with that age-old playground maxim: two wrongs do not make a right. In the face of accusations of war crimes or crimes against humanity it is simply no excuse or defence to say, but the other guys did it first. Where and when would that ever end? Self-defence; yes, of course. But in accordance with international law. And certainly not by means of war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
,  
	The Canadian government and numerous commentators have harshly criticized human rights groups like Amnesty International and others who insist on condemning all violations and abuses, by both sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The current fashion is to accuse us of engaging in ‘moral relativism’. By criticizing Israeli forces for violating international law we are apparently implicitly equating them to Hamas, who we also condemn for violating international law. And that somehow means that we are saying both sides are equally bad. 
,  
	Prime Minister Harper sharply rebuked those who criticize Israel’s human rights record in his speech to the Israeli Knesset in January of this year, essentially labelling us moral relativists who ‘go along to get along’. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird made it clear in a speech to the American Jewish Congress in Washington back in May that when it comes to Canadian foreign policy with respect to Israel, “there is no room for moral relativism”. In a statement issued on 15 July of this year, responding to the Gaza crisis, Minister Baird insisted that, “the scourge of terrorism must be wholly rejected by all peace-loving people around the world. We must never allow moral relativism to act as cover for the indiscriminate attacks on Israel we have seen over the past eight days.” 
,  
	Using outraged and lecturing rhetoric about moral relativism to deflect criticism of Israel completely misses what international human rights and humanitarian laws are all about. International law is never about assigning equal or equivalent blame between parties to a conflict or among countries. It is about blame, not about equivalency. If one side violates rights, that is wrong and blameworthy and should be stopped and remedied. If the other side violates rights, that is wrong and blameworthy and should be stopped and remedied. International human rights and humanitarian norms do not assess the good guys versus the bad and let the good guys off the hook when they break the law. That is politics, not law. 
,  
	Amnesty International is pressed repeatedly by governments, reporters and others to do just that; to engage in equivalency. We are asked to rank and compare all the time. Which side is worse? How does country X compare to country Y? Are things better or worse in country Z this year? 
,  
	And we refuse to do so. We refuse because that is not what universal human rights protection strives to achieve. It is not only about protecting rights against violations by whichever fighting force has the worst record. We are not only concerned about and ready to condemn the human rights records of the top twenty violating nations. And we do not excuse violations when committed by a democratically elected government. It is about protecting rights. Everyone’s. Everywhere. End of story. 
,  
	That is what has been sold so grievously short amidst Canada’s hectoring and posturing throughout this summer’s Gaza/Israel crisis. Behind the defiant insistence that Canada will not engage in moral relativism, and thus not criticize Israel, is this implicit, chilling message: some people’s rights matter much more than others. 
,  
	That is not in the interests of Palestinians, obviously. Nor Israelis. And for a country that believes in and strives towards universal human rights protection, it is not in the interests of Canadians. 
,  
	It is time to take arguments about moral relativism out of Canadian foreign policy, particularly with respect to Israel. What Palestinians need, what Israelis need and what the world needs to hear from Canada is a principled, consistent defence of all human rights. It doesn’t get any more moral than that. And there is nothing relative about it.

	Travel guides describe Mexico as one of the world’s great civilisations, whose landscapes are as stunning as they are diverse. But there’s a dark flipside to the family-friendly resorts and shimmering blue coastlines: Mexico is suffering from an epidemic of torture. 
Here we look some sickening facts about torture in Mexico and what you can do to help. 
Torture in Mexico is, quite frankly, out of control. In the last ten years alone, there has been a 600 per cent rise in the number of reported cases of torture. Between 2010 and the end of 2013, the National Human Rights Commission received more than 7,000 complaints of torture. 
An Amnesty survey recently found that a whopping 64 per cent of Mexican citizens are afraid they would be tortured if they were ever to be detained by the police. In the same survey, Australia and China came out at 16 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. 
Torture techniques in Mexico all have one thing in common: they’re brutal. 
Survivors from around the country report a multitude of torture techniques, including mock executions, cruel beatings, stress positions, asphyxiation,	electric shocks and sexual violence. 
In 2009, Ángel Amílcar Colón Quevedo, a migrant who had travelled to Mexico hoping to earn money to pay for cancer treatment for his eight-year-old son, was arrested and tortured by the Mexican police and army solely because of his ethnicity and his status as a migrant. 
Ángel was beaten and kicked repeatedly by his captors, forced to lick clean the shoes of other detainees, nearly asphyxiated with a plastic bag. 
Frighteningly, those tasked with protecting the public and upholding justice often carry out horrific torture during criminal investigations. 
Torture is often overlooked because it is considered “necessary” to enable the police and military to catch suspected offenders and reassure public opinion. Amnesty has spoken to many torture survivors who said they would have said and done anything to make the pain stop. 
In September 2012, Adrián Vázquez was arrested by the police and subjected to 12 hours of torture, during which time he was threatened, beaten and asphyxiated. Eventually Adrián was rushed to hospital to undergo life-saving surgery because of his injuries. 
An investigation into Adrián’s treatment by police was never ordered or carried out. 
They know it’s happening, we know it’s happening, yet the Mexican Government has so far refused acknowledge the widespread torture across the country. 
On paper, Mexico’s commitment to preventing torture is impressive, having ratified, among other things, the UN Convention against Torture. Yet despite its own laws, the government allows torture to be used to get confessions, and Mexican courts regularly accept such confessions. 
What’s more, the Mexican Government lets torturers get away with it – only seven people have ever been convicted in Mexico’s federal courts. 
But there is hope. Mexico is sensitive about its public image and is showing signs it is open to improving the way it deals with torture.	Don’t miss this rare opportunity – act now against torture. 
Many arrests in Mexico are made without a warrant, with people sometimes being arrested without having any direct connection to a crime or crime scene. 
Those arrested without evidence are often from poor communities and they have little chance of accessing legal support, which increases their risk of suffering torture. 
People who are tortured, their relatives, and those activists defending their human rights often face threats and intimidation. As a result, very few victims are willing to make formal complaints. 
Since 2002, Inés Fernández Ortega and Valentina Rosendo Cantú have been fighting for justice against the Mexican soldiers who tortured and raped them in separate attacks. 
In August 2010 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered a full civilian investigation, as well as reparations to Inés and Valentina and reforms to Mexico’s military justice system. 
Earlier this year the Mexican Government took a huge step towards justice for the two women, by finally bringing the accused to trial. 
In the early hours of 7 August 2012 Claudia Medina, a mother of three, woke to the frightening sound of marines breaking into her home in Veracruz City, Mexico. 
Claudia, a natural medicine salesperson, was arrested and taken to a local naval base. 
Over the next few days, Claudia suffered terrible torture, including electric shocks and sexual abuse, being beaten and kicked. Her torturers even forced chilli sauce up her nose with a syringe. 
To make the torture stop, Claudia signed a statement she hadn’t read, later discovering it was a false confession that she belonged to a criminal gang. Claudia maintains her innocence.

0,Disappearances in Syria: The ghosts of the war,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-disappearances-in-syria-the-ghosts-of-the-war/,"The last time Rania (not her real name) spoke to her friend Mohamed Bachir Arab, was on 1 November 2011.

As a hard working doctor and committed political activist, Mohamed had been living in hiding for six months, trying to evade the ever present tentacles of the Syrian intelligence forces, who routinely detain peaceful activists like him. 
The following day her worst fears were realized. A strap line on the evening news announced he had been arrested. None of his relatives knew where he had been taken. 
Mohamed was a marked man. He had been a student leader at his university in the city of Aleppo, in north-west Syria. Over the years, he had organized a number of protests against government policies, which had landed him in trouble with the authorities. Between 2004 and 2005 he was detained for several months before being released. 
But this time, his relatives and colleagues feared it was different. Since the crisis in Syria began in March 2011, the number of individuals who have been detained in secret by the state – or forcibly disappeared – has spiralled out of control. 
 
“The Syrian authorities’ strategy to deal with dissent is brutal: speak against them once and they’ll arrest you; do it again and they will simply make you disappear,” said Philip Luther, Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
Many of those lucky enough to be released, after months sometimes years in detention, bear the scars of the brutal treatment they have been subjected to. 
Most of them have spoken about passing through a number of the detention centres that make up the dark maze of abuse controlled by the Syrian security forces and intelligence agencies. 
“When someone is arrested and detained in secret the likelihood is that they will be tortured to extract information from them or as a form of punishment. Syria’s sickening track record means there is a high risk such abuse will result in serious damage to the disappeared person’s health or even death,” said Philip Luther. 
And for those left behind, the pain of not knowing is intolerable. 
As soon Mohamed’s family learned about his arrest, they began trying to find clues about where he was being held. 
Initially they drew a blank. But after a while news started to filter through. A number of men released from some of the country’s most infamous detention centres tipped them off that they had seen him at various locations. 
Shortly after his arrest Mohamed had been spotted in the Air Force Intelligence branch in Aleppo and later in a hospital in the same city. The man said Mohamed was suffering from head injuries, reportedly as a result of being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. 
Amnesty International has spoken to several people who were held in that detention centre. One of them, who now lives outside of Syria and asked for his name not to be revealed, said that life in the centre was so bad he often wished he were dead. 
He described how detainees were often severely beaten, held in overcrowded cells, and that the lack of drinking water forced some to drink from the toilet. The extreme lack of hygiene caused the spread of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, which contributed to the death of several detainees. 
According to other released detainees, Mohamed was seen at other detention centres including the al-Ameerya branch of Air Force Intelligence in Damascus and the Qaboun branch of Military Intelligence. 
But news of his whereabouts has been scant. Earlier this year, another man said he had seen Mohamed at Saydnaya Military Prison, where he may have been brought before a Military Field Court – but his fate is still unknown. 
“The fact that almost three years after Mohamed was taken into custody no one knows where he is paints a scandalous picture of how the Syrian authorities’ dark network of detention centres functions. Brutal security forces hold detainees in secret and move them around the country without even thinking about the enormous distress to which they are subjecting their families,” said Philip Luther. 
Mohamed is one of a long list of peaceful activists, lawyers, journalists and humanitarian workers perceived as opposed to the policies of the Syrian authorities who have been detained in secret by the security forces. Many of them are still missing. 
Names include: Ali Mahmoud Othman, a citizen journalist, arrested in Homs in March 2012; Juwan Abd Rahman Khaled, a Kurdish activist, detained in Damascus in September 2012; Khalil Ma’touq, a human rights lawyer, last seen at a checkpoint near Damascus in October 2012; and Nasser Saber Bondek, a poet and humanitarian activist, taken from his home in Damascus in February 2014. 
The list goes on. They are the ghosts of Syria’s war. 
Speaking from her new home outside of Syria, Rania says she will continue to look for Mohamed: “I haven’t had any real news of Mohamed in eight months, but we will continue to look for him. He is a very peaceful person so I don’t know why he is in prison. Things need to change in Syria.”

“It is long past time for the government to take responsibility to fix what they have broken, clean up our river, and help us out rather than kicking us while we are down.” — Grassy Narrows Chief Roger Fobister Sr. 
For almost a decade, Amnesty International has stood with the people of Grassy Narrows in their long struggle to determine for themselves the fate of the forest and waters on which they depend. This campaign–  led by the people of Grassy Narrow, and supported by a wide range of social justice and environmental organizations —  has had remarkable success with company after company announcing that they will not log at Grassy Narrows, or handle wood cut  at Grassy Narrows, unless the community gives its consent. These remarkable victories, however, have taken place against the backdrop of an ongoing, unresolved and largely unacknowledged tragedy. 
Throughout the 1960s, an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped approximately 20,000 pounds or 9 metric tonnes of mercury into rivers and lakes vital to the people of the Grassy Narrows and the neighboring White Dog First Nation. When the contamination was discovered in 1970, there were already signs of severe mercury poisoning – including loss of muscle control and other neurological degeneration — among fishers, guides and others who regularly ate fish from the contaminated waters. 
In the decades that have followed, community members have reported an ongoing health crisis, with high rates of neurological impairments and other chronic illnesses. Tragically, these chronic problems are even hurting young people born long after the communities were assured that their waters would be safe again. 
Despite this, the provincial government has never publicly acknowledged that mercury dumping — which it permitted — has led to mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. The limited compensation that is provided to people with symptoms associated with mercury poisoning is based on outdated models of how mercury affects human health. And the federal and provincial governments have failed to carry any significant ongoing monitoring of the health of the people at Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. 
On top of this, the provincial government continues to make plans to restart clearcut logging at Grassy Narrows, without addressing the role of clearcutting in introducing additional mercury into the water system. 
A government commissioned review, carried out in 2009 and publicly released earlier this summer, is highly critical of the government’s failure to address the medical needs of Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. The independent scientific review noted that there should have been “extensive examinations and follow-up” from the 1970s forward and that many of the current health problems faced by the people of Grassy Narrows and Whitedog  “have not been properly diagnosed and documented.” 
In fact, the only ongoing research g has been carried out by doctors from Minamata, Japan. Mercury poisoning is widely known as “Minamata disease” because of the widespread deaths and severe, ongoing health problems still faced by thousands of people as the result of decades of industrial methylmercury releases into Minamata Bay. After years of the struggle by the survivors and their families, Minamata has emerged as a centre of expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of Minamata disease. In fact, the government commissioned review released this summer noted the contrast between the unmet medical needs of the people of Grassy Narrows and the “superb health care” now enjoyed by the people of Minamata. 
This week a team of scientists from Minamata will be back in Canada to carry out new studies in Grassy Narrows and Whitedog, including the first study in these communities of potential impacts of fetal exposure to mercury contamination. 
It’s hoped that this visit will at last put enough pressure on the provincial government that it can no longer ignore the health crisis facing these First Nations.

“It is long past time for the government to take responsibility to fix what they have broken, clean up our river, and help us out rather than kicking us while we are down.” — Grassy Narrows Chief Roger Fobister Sr. 
,  
For almost a decade, Amnesty International has stood with the people of Grassy Narrows in their long struggle to determine for themselves the fate of the forest and waters on which they depend. This campaign–  led by the people of Grassy Narrow, and supported by a wide range of social justice and environmental organizations —  has had remarkable success with company after company announcing that they will not log at Grassy Narrows, or handle wood cut  at Grassy Narrows, unless the community gives its consent. These remarkable victories, however, have taken place against the backdrop of an ongoing, unresolved and largely unacknowledged tragedy. 
,  
Throughout the 1960s, an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped approximately 20,000 pounds or 9 metric tonnes of mercury into rivers and lakes vital to the people of the Grassy Narrows and the neighboring White Dog First Nation. When the contamination was discovered in 1970, there were already signs of severe mercury poisoning – including loss of muscle control and other neurological degeneration — among fishers, guides and others who regularly ate fish from the contaminated waters. 
,  
In the decades that have followed, community members have reported an ongoing health crisis, with high rates of neurological impairments and other chronic illnesses. Tragically, these chronic problems are even hurting young people born long after the communities were assured that their waters would be safe again. 
,  
Despite this, the provincial government has never publicly acknowledged that mercury dumping — which it permitted — has led to mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. The limited compensation that is provided to people with symptoms associated with mercury poisoning is based on outdated models of how mercury affects human health. And the federal and provincial governments have failed to carry any significant ongoing monitoring of the health of the people at Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. 
,  
On top of this, the provincial government continues to make plans to restart clearcut logging at Grassy Narrows, without addressing the role of clearcutting in introducing additional mercury into the water system. 
,  
A government commissioned review, carried out in 2009 and publicly released earlier this summer, is highly critical of the government’s failure to address the medical needs of Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. The independent scientific review noted that there should have been “extensive examinations and follow-up” from the 1970s forward and that many of the current health problems faced by the people of Grassy Narrows and Whitedog  “have not been properly diagnosed and documented.” 
,  
In fact, the only ongoing research g has been carried out by doctors from Minamata, Japan. Mercury poisoning is widely known as “Minamata disease” because of the widespread deaths and severe, ongoing health problems still faced by thousands of people as the result of decades of industrial methylmercury releases into Minamata Bay. After years of the struggle by the survivors and their families, Minamata has emerged as a centre of expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of Minamata disease. In fact, the government commissioned review released this summer noted the contrast between the unmet medical needs of the people of Grassy Narrows and the “superb health care” now enjoyed by the people of Minamata. 
,  
This week a team of scientists from Minamata will be back in Canada to carry out new studies in Grassy Narrows and Whitedog, including the first study in these communities of potential impacts of fetal exposure to mercury contamination. 
,  
It’s hoped that this visit will at last put enough pressure on the provincial government that it can no longer ignore the health crisis facing these First Nations.

	After three years of the Syrian uprising, it often appears like the world is tuning out. Deaths continue on a daily basis, some 9 million Syrians are listed by the U.N. as either refugees or internally displaced people, but the situation is sliding out of attention on news broadcasts, in newspaper headlines and popular attention. 
This is why the beheading of reporter James Foley is so important to anyone concerned about human rights in the region. It’s important not just because, as Amnesty International says, it is “a war crime,” but because Syria right now by most standards is now the most dangerous place in the world for journalists. 
 
The world loses attention to a crisis for many reasons, but in Syria, one key reason is because journalists increasingly aren’t able to report on the crisis. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) states that at least 69 journalists have been killed covering the conflict. More than 80 have been kidnapped. CPJ estimates that approximately 20 journalists are currently missing in Syria, many held by Islamic State. 
The crimes have been committed by both the Assad regime and by armed opposition groups such as Islamic State, the group that beheaded Foley. Both groups are literally “shooting the messenger.” (See Amnesty International report: Shooting the Messenger: Journalists targeted by all sides in Syria) 
  
	Under such circumstances, it’s not surprising that some news organizations have pulled back their reporters, and those that remain are being more cautious in their travels. 
But the consequences are significant. Foley once told an audience at Northwestern University, his alma mater, that he wanted to report from the Middle East because, “We’re not close enough to it. And if reporters, if we don’t try to get really close to what these guys – men, women, American [soldiers], now, with this Arab revolution, young Arab men, young Egyptians and Libyans – are experiencing, we don’t understand the world.” 
When reporters like James Foley can’t do their job, the rest of the world falls back on stereotypes and preconceived notions about societies they don’t know anything about. The commentary and analysis is left to people whose expertise often is second hand. We stop paying attention. 
That’s bad for policy and it’s bad for human rights because activism starts with the documentation of abuses that journalists can do. That’s true in Syria, and for that matter, it’s even true when journalists get arrested in Ferguson, Mo. When journalists are silenced, it’s a win for the abusers. 
James Foley and others stood up to the threat and he should be honored for that essential work. The best way to remember him would be for the international community to redouble its efforts and press for the protection of journalists in Syria. 
The Islamic State and all armed groups must release all civilians, rights defenders and journalists such as Foley’s American colleague Steven Sotloff. The Assad regime must stop its own abusive practices against journalists, including the enforced disappearance of Ali Mahmoud Othman. 
The messengers must be able to speak.

(BORGO MEZZANONE, ITALY) Ebrima’s bedroom is a stark corrugated square, five metres long and five metres wide. He shares it with one other asylum seeker – each has a foam mattress over a camp bed to sleep on. Wires dangle from a broken light in the ceiling and the floor is carpeted in dust, crumbs and the odd seashell. 
The Asylum Seekers Reception Centre at Borgo Mezzanone, Southern Italy, has been his home for the past six months. In this disused airbase which was turned into a detention centre, conditions are dire. But after a harrowing journey from Africa, through the Sahara and across the Mediterranean, Ebrima doesn’t even seem to notice. He is happy to be here. 
He tells me his journey started in Sierra Leone after the death of his Muslim father. The Christian community where he lived wanted him gone. Even his stepmother’s family tried to force him to convert from Islam to Christianity. 
“My stepmother’s family were not good people. They threatened me with violence and told me to choose Christianity or leave. So I had to leave,” Ebrima said when we met at the reception centre. 
Ebrima speaks in English, animatedly and articulately. He wears a red t-shirt and shorts, with a wide red baseball cap cocked on his head at a jaunty angle. He refuses to be cowed by the tough hand life has dealt him. 
“I’m 20, I am young. Sierra Leone was a mess. I want a better life, but I need stability and an education.” 
The risks he has been prepared to take to find that stable life are astonishing. He says he left home without money or a passport, travelling only with his student ID. A trained mechanic, he took the bus to Mali and spent a month working his way to Burkina Faso, then to Niger. There he worked for three more months, saving money for the border crossing through the Sahara to Libya. It was in Niger’s dusty city, Agadez, where he says he made contact with a group of smugglers. 
“An Arab man offered to get me into Libya. It cost 20 dollars up front and I would work for him there until I paid off the rest ($580 USD). A lot of money, but I was determined.” 
	Afraid to get caught, the smugglers don’t take the mountain road through Algeria to Tripoli. Instead they plough their Toyota pick-up trucks through close to 2,500km of Saharan desert to Sabha. Ebrima has a bright and lively personality, but his hands go deep into his pockets and he looks down at his feet when I ask how he got to Libya. 
“It’s difficult to talk about that journey,” Ebrima says. “Thirty-seven people in a pick-up, driving for seven days. We had some food and water, but the sun burns your skin and the sand sticks to it. Two guys in our group died. We passed one, two, three more bodies on the road – they had been thrown out of the trucks before us. In the desert you don’t have time to bury bodies.” 
Things weren’t much easier in Tripoli. A black sub-Saharan African in Libya is an instant target for security forces – and migrants and asylum-seekers can be held indefinitely if caught. Those without correct documents are particularly at risk. Ebrima says he was forced underground, cooking and cleaning as a domestic worker to repay the cost of his journey across the Sahara, and saving for the $1,100 boat crossing to Europe. 
Ebrima describes how working in Libya without a valid permit is fraught with danger. Over the next few months, he became friends with Bubacary, another African domestic worker, who had arrived in Libya slightly earlier than Ebrima. Once Bubacary had saved enough for the crossing, he collected his pay and was sneaking home from work after dark when he was stopped by a group of armed men. They demanded he hand over his money, he refused. They shot Bubacary in the leg, then the shoulder, then they took the $1,100 dollars. 
When Ebrima found Bubacary he was bleeding heavily, but they had to wait hours for their Libyan employer to bring him to hospital. As two sub-Saharan African men, they feared they would have their documents checked, and time in a Libyan immigration detention centre could lead to death. Bubacary died the next day. 
The following week Ebrima made the crossing to Italy. The smugglers jammed him onto a small fishing boat with 150 others and handed them a compass and walkie-talkie. They were told to head north and call the Italian Navy as soon as they were out to sea, but it wasn’t long before they were lost. Ebrima and the others drifted three days before they were picked up and taken to the Italian base at Lampedusa, Sicily. 
Six months on, Ebrima is awaiting the result of his asylum application. If he’s rejected, he will be handed a note instructing him to leave Italy in seven days. He’s optimistic, but even if he is granted asylum here in Italy his future is uncertain. His English is good, but his Italian non-existent. He told me what he really wanted to do was to work as a mechanic in England, and asked why the UK is so hard to immigrate to. I couldn’t answer. 
Italy is rescuing and accommodating thousands of people crossing the Mediterranean each year, much more than any other European Union country. Meanwhile other European countries close their borders, detain those that make it through and even push crammed boats back into the sea. Forced out of their homes in fear of violence, people like Ebrima have remarkable stories of endurance. They risk everything to find sanctuary, only to falter at the gates of Fortress Europe. 
And it’s not just young men from sub-Saharan Africa, looking for a better life. The crisis in Syria provides another chilling example – just 2.4% of those who have fled the country have managed to get through and claim asylum in the EU. Europe must do more. 
Northern European countries must strengthen the search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean – identifying boats in distress and assisting those on board. And they must treat those they rescue with dignity, give them access to asylum procedures and stop once and for all unlawful operations to push refugees and asylum-seekers back across the border.

By Kathy Price	Colombia Campaigner, Amnesty International 
	The terrible news came via a skype call from Colombia. Juan Pablo Gutiérrez, the big-hearted, creative, hard-working advocate for the rights of threatened Indigenous peoples and collaborator with Amnesty Canada, told me about receiving an envelope containing a death threat from the notorious Aguilas Negras (Black Eagles), a feared paramilitary group. 
	The message warned that Juan Pablo was now a paramilitary target and would be killed for his work with the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC), a coalition with whom Amnesty International Canada has worked closely in recent years. 
	The death threat had been delivered to Juan Pablo as he waited for public transit near his home, en route to work, making clear that the paramilitaries had been monitoring his movements and knew where to find him. 
	I first met Juan Pablo when he got in touch to ask how he could support Amnesty Canada’s work on behalf of disappeared Embera Katío leader Kimy Pernia Domicó. At that time, Juan Pablo was living in France and working as a hugely talented photographer. Within no time, he had designed beautiful banners with Kimy’s image, which were invaluable in attracting attention to our campaign. 
	We continued to work together after Juan Pablo returned to his homeland and began a project with ONIC to make visible, via photography, some of the Indigenous nations whose very survival is threatened by assaults on their lands and lives. The end result was a powerful collection of portraits of Indigenous women and men holding hand-written messages to Canadians about the dangers they face and their hopes for a future of peace in their territory. Those photos, entitled “This is what we want to tell you” (link to photo gallery), have been shown over 70 times in communities across Canada, inspiring thousands of people to support actions to protect Indigenous women, men and children at serious risk. 
	Now the inspiring young man who made all of that possible is himself at risk. But just as Juan Pablo has always lifted his camera and his voice in defence of the threatened, we too must raise our voices now to defend this courageous, determined, tireless defender of Indigenous rights. 
	Join us to send a collective message of international concern that cannot be ignored: Colombia must guarantee the protection of Juan Pablo Gutiérrez and ensure he can continue his vital work without fear of harm. Thank you for sharing this message and our action with friends and family. Together we can make a difference!

,  
	On June 19, the federal government passed Bill C-24, a new law which reportedly is designed to “Strengthen Canadian Citizenship”. Amnesty International believes the bill has serious human rights flaws. 
,  
Under this new law, Canadian citizenship will become harder to get and easier to lose. It will take away rights from countless Canadians, creating a two-tier citizenship regime that discriminates against dual nationals and naturalized citizens. 
,  
Amnesty International is concerned that the new law gives the federal government powers to revoke Canadian citizenship in some cases when individuals are convicted of specified crimes related to terrorism and similar offences. 
,  
The revocation procedure in Bill C-24 fails to uphold the international standards that guarantee fair hearings. For instance, the Minister is not required to specify the grounds on which he or she is making the decision to revoke citizenship and there is no basis on which to appeal the decision. Amnesty International believes that fair trial requirements must be observed in any process leading to possible revocation of citizenship. These serious deficiencies with respect to the fairness of the revocation procedure were not addressed in the passing of the bill. 
,  
The revocation provisions in Bill C-24 also distinguish between Canadians who have no other nationality and individuals who carry one or more other nationalities in addition to their Canadian citizenship. Differentiating between Canadian citizens on the basis of national origin risks fueling a climate in which some Canadians are seen as ‘true’ Canadians while others are viewed as inherently suspicious or disloyal. In that divisive climate, certain groups may find themselves exposed to discrimination. Amnesty International believes these provisions are out of step with the Canadian trend of developing an inclusive concept of citizenship. 
,  
Given the quick passage of the bill through the House of Commons and Senate, Amnesty was not able to appear before either body to raise its concerns. Amnesty did prepare a brief on the Bill which was sent to the Senate Committee studying the bill, and shared with all Senators on the Committee. 
,  
The Bill was passed in spite of concerns raised by many human rights groups, including a petition of over 25,000 signatures sponsored by the BC Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL). The petition asked the Citizenship Minister to not pass Bill C-24. 
,  
Amnesty International participated in a joint press release with CARL and BCCLA stating that the new law has dramatically negative effects on Canadian citizenship, eliminating equal citizenship rights for all, and violating the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as international human rights.

On June 6, during an early morning raid, state police forces burned more than 200 homes and structures to the ground in the village of Wingima. The homes, located near the Porgera gold mine in central Papua New Guinea, belong mostly to mine workers and artisanal miners and their families. The mine is majority-owned and operated by Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold Corporation. 
“I didn’t steal gold and I didn’t do anything wrong. Why are they burning my house?” 
On June 10, Amnesty International issued a public statement calling on the authorities to provide assistance to the families left homeless and to ensure their access to effective remedy. Calling the police actions illegal and its response to illegal mining or unlawful activity as excessive and out of step with international standards, Amnesty International’s Pacific Researcher Kate Schuetze said, “these illegal and dangerous actions endangered lives and have left scores of families homeless…Destroying people’s homes and livelihoods in this way violates international laws against forced evictions. All those responsible must be prosecuted.” 
Amnesty International has called on Barrick Gold and the PNG government to ensure that any relocations of residents are carried out in compliance with international human rights standards. 
Community residents believe the police were acting in an effort to curb unauthorized mining activity in the region. In the spring of 2014, local government officials declared a State of Emergency in the region, in an attempt to address ‘law and order issues’.  Last December, there were reports of violent clashes between locals and private security guards linked to the mine, which reportedly left five people dead. 
The situation is eerily similar to events documented by Amnesty International in its 2010 report, “Undermining Rights: Forced evictions and police brutality around the Porgera Gold Mine, Papua New Guinea”. Between April and July, 2009, police forces burned down 130 structures near the Porgera mine. Amnesty learned that the police Mobile Squad, which carried out the raids and evictions within the Porgera ‘special mining license’ area, received food, accommodation and vehicles from the Porgera Joint Venture (the PJV is 95% owned by Barrick Gold and 5% owned by PNG’;s NMineral Resources Enga).  
It is of critical importance that individuals or communities who have experienced human rights abuses associated with the operations of a company have meaningful access to an effective remedy for the harms they have endured.  Parent companies should be held responsible for human rights abuses arising in their global operations – and people who have been harmed by the activities of Canadian companies overseas should have access to remedy in Canada.

The place is dusty, noisy and dangerous. Vehicles race by day and night on the main road under the bridge. “We have to be on alert every minute, to stop the children running to the road”, he tells me. “The cars and lorries drive by very fast”, he says. There is no electricity, water or sanitation. “We go get water from the nearby mosque and people bring us food. We are very grateful to the people of Dohuk, they are real brothers”, says Suleiman. “We arrived with nothing other than the clothes we were wearing. People, and also an organization, brought us some blankets and other things. This is enough for now. The most important thing is that we are safe.” 
Having managed to flee an Islamic State assault on their hometown in the Sinjar region on 3 August, Suleiman and his family found themselves stranded on Sinjar Mountain with tens of thousands of other civilians. Trapped by militants who had surrounded them and cut off all access roads to the mountain, they spent a gruelling eight days in the scorching heat. “I ate leaves and grass”, says Suleiman. “When we fled we carried as much water as we could. The little children carried one litre of water, I carried 15 litres and my oldest son carried 20 litres. We rationed it very strictly during our time on the mountain and that saved us.” 
 
When the mountain siege was eventually broken, mostly by Syrian Kurdish fighters who opened a safe passage from the north of the mountain, thousands of desperate people began to stream out. “There wasn’t enough space for everyone on the vehicles sent to rescue us. Me and my family walked for 13 hours”, recalls Suleiman. “My youngest son got sick. When we reached the refugee camp in Syria he spent two days in hospital there. He is not even one year old – his first birthday will be on 1 September”. The little boy has been unwell again in recent days and the dangerous and unsanitary living conditions under the bridge are making matters worse. 
What is being done? Yesterday the UN refugee agency announced an imminent large-scale aid operation for half a million people displaced by the conflict in northern Iraq, and last week the UN designated the humanitarian crisis in Iraq a “Level 3 Emergency” (the highest alert), recognizing that there had already been crucial delays in responding and promising additional resources. 
These additional resources can’t come soon enough. They’re needed for tens of thousands of displaced people who, like Suleiman and his family, are living in dire conditions and have no hope of being able to return home in the foreseeable future. 
Suleiman, like many others from minority communities, says he now doesn’t want to stay in Iraq. “We from the Yezidi community have endured years of persecution. My daughter still bears the scars of the injury she sustained in the bombings of our hometown on 14 August. Now we’ve lost our homes, everything we had worked our whole life for. There is nothing for us to go back to.” 
Christians displaced from Sinjar and Mosul have spoken to me in very similar terms. Fadi Khachik, a Christian resident of Sinjar now sheltering in a village near Dohuk with his wife and family, said: 
“I left my home in Sinjar on 2 August to get married in nearby Bartallah, my wife’s home town. Islamic State attacked Sinjar the following day and Bartallah a few days later. Now we and our families are living as refugees. Our homes and properties have been looted. I cannot see that it will ever be possible for me to go back home. It is best for us to go to another country, where we can be safe.” 
Meanwhile, Dr Houda, a medical doctor at Mosul hospital who fled the city following an ultimatum from Islamic State on 18 July, told me Islamic State militants stole money and jewellery from her and other Christians as they left Mosul. She said she could not imagine going back to Mosul after what had happened. 
Conditions for minorities in northern Iraq had already deteriorated significantly in recent years, prompting many to leave the country. The situation has now become a major crisis, with Islamic State gunmen systematically targeting non-Sunni Muslims communities and forcing them out of areas under their control. Their first targets were the Shi’a Turkmen and Shabak communities. Then came the turn of the Christians residents of Mosul, given an 18 July deadline to convert to Islamic State’s interpretation of Islam, pay a minority tax, leave, or be killed. Most recently, since the beginning of this month, Islamic State has turned on the Yezidi minority, whom they consider “devil worshippers”, demanding they “convert” or face death. 
For many people in northern Iraq their entire future now hangs by a thread. 
Iraq’s minority communities and other displaced people in their thousands are in desperate need of safe shelter and humanitarian assistance. The international community must spare no efforts to provide this without further delay.

Scores of people were killed and hundreds abducted by ISIS fighters in Kocho, a small village about 15 km south of the town of Sinjar. 
This fresh atrocity was a bitter reminder of the ferocity of ISIS’s advance. Since 3 August, when the armed group began its march to take control of the territory surrounding Sinjar, they have forced tens of thousands of Yezidis from their homes, killed hundreds and abducted thousands. 
After two days of searching, I finally found some of the survivors of the Kocho attack, who had managed to escape from ISIS-controlled territory. They are injured, weary and terrified about the fate of their families. They told me that scores of their relatives and neighbours were killed and they have no news about their families and other villagers. They don’t know if their parents, children and siblings are dead or alive. 
Elias, a 59-year-old nurse, told me: “At 11-11.30 (on Friday 15 August) ISIS called all the residents to the secondary school, which has been their headquarters since they came to the village two weeks ago. There they asked that we hand over our money, our mobile phones, and for the women to hand over their jewellery. After about 15 minutes they brought vehicles and started to fill them up with men and boys. They pushed about 20 of us onto the back of a Kia pick-up vehicle and drove us about one kilometre east of the village. They got us off the vehicle by the pool and made us crouch on the ground in a tight cluster and one of them photographed us. I thought then they’d let us go after that, but they opened fire at us from behind us. I was hit in the left knee, but the bullet only grazed my knee.” 
He showed me a bullet-sized hole in his trousers, by his injured knee. 
“I let myself fall forward, as if I were dead, and I stayed there face down without moving. When the shooting stopped I kept still and after they left, I ran away. Five or six others were also alive and they also ran from the place. The rest were all killed. I know two of them, they were right next to me: Khider Matto Qasem, 28, and Ravo Mokri Salah, about 80 years old. I don’t know who the others were; I was too scared to look around, I couldn’t focus. I don’t know what happened to my family, my wife, my seven children, my son’s wife and their two children; I don’t know if they are dead or alive or where they are. I can’t contact anyone as they took our mobile phones.” 
Khider, a 17-year-old student, told me that he was also part of the first group of men and youths who were bundled into vehicles and taken to the village’s outskirts to be shot. 
“There was no order, they (ISIS) just filled up vehicles indiscriminately. Me and my cousin, Ghaleb Elias, were pushed into the same vehicle. We were next to each other as they lined us up on the ground. He was killed. He was the same age as me, and worked as daily labourer, mostly in construction. I have no news of what happened to my parents and my four brothers and six sisters. Did they kill them? Did they abduct them? I don’t know anything about them.” 
Khider escaped with what looked like a superficial bullet wound to his back. 
A third survivor, Khalaf, a 32-year-old father of three young children, told me: 
“I was in the third group. Before me, they (ISIS) took away two other vehicles full of men and youth. We were driven a very short distance east, maybe 200 – 300 metres. There was nobody else where we were taken. We were 20 or 25 crammed in the back of the pick-up, I don’t know for sure. When we got there they made us stand in a row and then one of them shouted ‘God is Great’ [‘Allahu Akbar’] and then there was shooting. There were maybe 10 of them (ISIS) but they were behind us, I don’t know how many of them opened fire. I was hit twice, in the left hip and the left calf. 
“After the shooting stopped I heard the vehicles leave and another man and I got up and ran. I went in one direction and he in the other. I don’t know where he is now. I don’t know where anyone is, my children, my family. Where are they? Have they taken them? How can I find them?… Among those killed near me was Amin Salah Qasem, the brother of the Elias [the nurse who survived the first group killing], and his son ‘Asem, aged 10-12, and seven others whose names I know and another 10 or 12 whose names I don’t know because I could not see properly. I was so terrified; I kept my head down and when it became quiet and I was sure they had left I just ran away.” 
The total number of those killed in Kocho is not known. According to the three survivors I interviewed, after assembling the villagers at the local school, ISIS fighters took away at least three groups of men and boys to be killed – 20-25 at a time. Most of the men and boys in the first and third groups were killed, while it is believed between six and eight managed to escape. It is not known if any survived in the second group, also numbering 20-25 people. It is not known how many other groups suffered the same fate. There are reports that hundreds of men, women and children from Kocho were taken to Tal Afar – halfway between Sinjar and Mosul – where ISIS groups are holding other abducted Yezidi civilians. But that could not yet be confirmed. 
According to Kocho residents with whom I had been in contact prior to the incident, the village had a population of more than 1,200. Contact has been lost with them since Friday. Their relatives living elsewhere remain unable to get in touch and are extremely concerned for their safety. 
Kocho had been under siege by ISIS groups since they took control of the Sinjar region on 3 August, and contact with residents has since been difficult. 
Survivors of last Friday’s killing told me that pressure from ISIS fighters increased significantly a week ago, after residents of the nearby village of Hatemiyah, which had similarly been surrounded by ISIS, managed to escape: 
“Since then surveillance on us became much tighter. We couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. We just stayed in our homes. ISIS initially demanded that we should convert [to the armed group’s fundamentalist brand of Sunni Islam] but later said we did not need to if we did not want to, and said nothing would happen to us. But we were afraid.” 
As it turns out, the people of Kocho were right to be afraid. 
Now the pressure is on to find out what has happened to the rest of Kocho’s residents.

Khider, a 17-year-old student, told me that he was also part of the first group of men and youths who were bundled into vehicles and taken to the village’s outskirts to be shot. 
,  
“There was no order, they (ISIS) just filled up vehicles indiscriminately. Me and my cousin, Ghaleb Elias, were pushed into the same vehicle. We were next to each other as they lined us up on the ground. He was killed. He was the same age as me, and worked as daily labourer, mostly in construction. I have no news of what happened to my parents and my four brothers and six sisters. Did they kill them? Did they abduct them? I don’t know anything about them.” 
,  
Khider escaped with what looked like a superficial bullet wound to his back.

A third survivor, Khalaf, a 32-year-old father of three young children, told me: 
,  
“I was in the third group. Before me, they (ISIS) took away two other vehicles full of men and youth. We were driven a very short distance east, maybe 200 – 300 metres. There was nobody else where we were taken. We were 20 or 25 crammed in the back of the pick-up, I don’t know for sure. When we got there they made us stand in a row and then one of them shouted ‘God is Great’ [‘Allahu Akbar’] and then there was shooting. There were maybe 10 of them (ISIS) but they were behind us, I don’t know how many of them opened fire. I was hit twice, in the left hip and the left calf. 
,  
“After the shooting stopped I heard the vehicles leave and another man and I got up and ran. I went in one direction and he in the other. I don’t know where he is now. I don’t know where anyone is, my children, my family. Where are they? Have they taken them? How can I find them?… Among those killed near me was Amin Salah Qasem, the brother of the Elias [the nurse who survived the first group killing], and his son ‘Asem, aged 10-12, and seven others whose names I know and another 10 or 12 whose names I don’t know because I could not see properly. I was so terrified; I kept my head down and when it became quiet and I was sure they had left I just ran away.” 
,  
,  
The total number of those killed in Kocho is not known. According to the three survivors I interviewed, after assembling the villagers at the local school, ISIS fighters took away at least three groups of men and boys to be killed – 20-25 at a time. Most of the men and boys in the first and third groups were killed, while it is believed between six and eight managed to escape. It is not known if any survived in the second group, also numbering 20-25 people. It is not known how many other groups suffered the same fate. There are reports that hundreds of men, women and children from Kocho were taken to Tal Afar – halfway between Sinjar and Mosul – where ISIS groups are holding other abducted Yezidi civilians. But that could not yet be confirmed. 
,  
According to Kocho residents with whom I had been in contact prior to the incident, the village had a population of more than 1,200. Contact has been lost with them since Friday. Their relatives living elsewhere remain unable to get in touch and are extremely concerned for their safety. 
,  
Kocho had been under siege by ISIS groups since they took control of the Sinjar region on 3 August, and contact with residents has since been difficult. 
,  
Survivors of last Friday’s killing told me that pressure from ISIS fighters increased significantly a week ago, after residents of the nearby village of Hatemiyah, which had similarly been surrounded by ISIS, managed to escape: 
,  
“Since then surveillance on us became much tighter. We couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. We just stayed in our homes. ISIS initially demanded that we should convert [to the armed group’s fundamentalist brand of Sunni Islam] but later said we did not need to if we did not want to, and said nothing would happen to us. But we were afraid.” 
,  
As it turns out, the people of Kocho were right to be afraid. 
,  
Now the pressure is on to find out what has happened to the rest of Kocho’s residents.

Several members of the community died in accidents, of disease. Nobody respected us. Now this is our victory. I am very happy, and I cry because my grandmother, my father and many members of my family did not have the opportunity I have...",",  
This week, as the United Nations marks the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples (August 9th), we want to take a moment to celebrate two crucial recent victories in the long struggle for the recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples. 
,  
On June 26, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in people had proven their continued ownership of – and right to control – a large swath of land in the heart of their traditional territory. The landmark decision at long last moves the constitutional recognition of Indigenous land title — previously largely abstract and routinely ignored — into the realm of practical reality.  
,  
Earlier in June, the President of Paraguay enacted a law that will allow the return of more than 14,400 hectares of land to the Sawhoyamaxa, a community of the Enxet Indigenous people. The community’s legal battle for recognition of their land rights, which began in 1991, eventually went to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Throughout this time, community members have lived in deplorable conditions in a precariously narrow strip of land between a major highway and the lands that had been taken from them. 
,  
In regional overview released today, Amnesty International called recognition of the land rights of the Sawhoyamaxa and Tsilhqot’in “victories of great importance not only for the Indigenous peoples of Paraguay and Canada but for all Indigenous peoples in the Americas and around the world.” 
,  
These victories are all the more important given the widespread human rights violations that Indigenous nations and communities –and individual Indigenous women, men and children — continue to face on a daily basis throughout the hemisphere. 
,  
In a press statement, Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said today, “Indigenous Peoples in the Americas continue to face a litany of abuse.” 
,  
Examples cited in the brief include exclusion of Indigenous peoples from decisions about resource development on their traditional territories, forced evictions of Indigenous communities, attacks on Indigenous human rights defenders, and the shockingly high rates of violence faced by Indigenous women in Canada. 
,  
In such a context, the long fought for recognition of the rights of the Tsilhqot’in and Sawhoyamaxa stand as powerful examples that entrenched forms of discrimination can be overcome. This is a history-making struggle for fundamental human rights that should compell us all to action.

My brother and I are experiencing the current Israel-Gaza conflict quite differently. He is 20, serving out his military service and has been fighting in Gaza. I, on the other hand, am the Executive Director of Amnesty International Israel, an organization that is now heavily involved in documenting and campaigning on apparent crimes perpetrated by both sides of this conflict. I am also a conscientious objector. 
My position does not diminish from the fact that I spend my days worried sick about him and other family members in similar situations. When you have such complexity in a family situation, humour is often the best approach, and so we joke sometimes that if the rest of the world heeds Amnesty International’s call for an arms embargo, I’ll be coming for his gun first. 
In this part of the world, humour is one of our ways of dealing with situations that are so terribly sad. From the start of this conflict, more than 1,800 Palestinians and 64 Israeli soldiers as well as three civilians in Israel have been killed. Each and every one of these lives lost – children, babies, elderly people, women, men, in Gaza and Israel alike – is tragic. Public discourse in Israel seeks relativity: If you must express sadness over people dying in Gaza, at least don’t be as sad as when it’s an Israeli that is killed. And make sure to note it’s Hamas’s fault, too. Plain simple sadness means that there must be something wrong with you: you must care about them more that about your own people. Traitor. 
As I refuse to take part in this, and instead see every life as sacred, without relativity, without context and without justification, I find human rights discourse to be a good refuge. While human rights are a legal framework, they are built on the basis of a higher moral code of the nations of the world at their best. We in Israel ought to have a special affinity towards human rights, as they were created in the aftermath of World War II, as the world’s way of saying ‘never again’. 
Nations came together then and decided that there must be limits to the absolute power a nation has over its own citizens, as well as those in countries with whom it is at war. It is a code that has existed in Judaism for centuries: Arvut Hadadit, mutual responsibility between all people, or as Amnesty International often refers to it: Solidarity. The idea is that countries will involve themselves in each other’s business to assure that a set of collectively adopted rights will be granted to each and every person in the world. 
Israel has been consistent in its support for the creation of human rights instruments. This includes the active role Israel took in establishing the Refugee Convention in the 1950s, or some good first steps on the Arms Trade Treaty, which was adopted just last year. 
Yet, as we have witnessed countless times, Israel has one standard for the rest of the world, and another for itself. Actions which amount to clear violations of human rights when another country commits them, are coined ‘political’ when they happen here, and if you criticize those actions you’ll be accused of ‘ignoring the context’, or Israel’s favorite: ‘criticizing us is anti-Semitic’. 
It’s 2:30 am, and I have just pulled my five year old son out of bed. I am holding him in the stairwell – our designated ‘safe zone’ – as the missile siren wails. In a minute, we’ll hear a few loud bangs, which we hope will be the Iron Dome intercepting rockets; rockets that were sent to kill us. My son spends his mornings in kindergarten, hearing about the soldiers protecting us. He boasts about his own uncle the brave soldier. The children draw pictures which are sent to the combatting army units and hung up on tanks and artillery. In the evening, during another siren, he asks me whether there are sirens in Gaza too. I explain that kids in Gaza have none, nor do they have an Iron Dome. “What protects kids there?” he asks. 
It seems that the last line of protection for kids in Gaza, for my kid, and for all civilians on both sides of this conflict, is the upholding of human rights. I truly hope that more people around the world take action, to call on all fighting parties to stop targeting civilians, and on their own countries to utilize the International Criminal Court and to impose arms embargoes, to keep us all safe.

There have been several this year – the most recent last Wednesday when Arizona spent two hours torturing Joseph Wood to death. The time has come to...","Another ‘botched’ execution in the United States. There have been several this year – the most recent last Wednesday when Arizona spent two hours torturing Joseph Wood to death. The time has come to acknowledge these executions cannot possibly be called ‘botched’ anymore. This torture can only be described as deliberate. 
“Botched” means that a process was ‘fouled up by incompetence or carelessness.’ Arguably carelessness is one possible explanation – but it is well known that the two drug combination used Wednesday in Arizona would result in prolonged and painful death. The US Supreme Court and others seem so willing to ignore evidence and expert testimony that there is no longer any reason to believe that a “humane” execution is intended or possible. 
In 1872 long drop hanging was introduced to make for a swifter end. Despite this and other methods of execution developed since then, not one has proven infallible. Inmates survive the electric chair, body parts explode during electrocution, bullets miss vital organs, hangings result in slow strangulation or decapitation, guillotine blades ‘stick’ – failing to sever the neck – and gassing has produced prolonged agonizing death. Even if a totally painless method of killing is found, the psychological torture of death row itself makes for an inhumane punishment. 
 
Lethal injection was discussed – and rejected – by the British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment more than 50 years ago. In 1977 it was adopted by Oklahoma and Texas and quickly followed by other states. The original three drug protocol was designed follow three stages: anesthesia, paralysis, kill. If the anaesthetic wore off or did not take effect the inmate, whether able to move or not, would be fully conscious through suffocation and organ failure. 
In 2007 Amnesty International released a report highlighting the ongoing issues of ‘botched’ lethal injection executions using the old method. Botched lethal injection is not new.  In May 2014 an entire book[i] studying US ‘botched’ executions revealed that of ALL methods of execution used in the US from 1890 to 2010, lethal injection had the highest rate of being ‘botched.’ 
Since 1977 medical advances reduced the medical reliance on drugs like sodium thiopental (the anaesthetic used in the first stage) and pancuronium bromide (the paralytic). Safer (less lethal) alternatives were far more popular and useful for most patients. For ethical reasons and following efforts by human rights groups and individuals the production of sodium thiopental ceased in the USA. States began to seek alternative drugs and modifying their execution procedures. 
 
It is at this stage that things got even more bizarre. Getting drugs became more difficult and the sources more obscure. The trade was forced underground. The European Union – a strong and united voice against the death penalty – restricted the sale or transfer of drugs that could be used in execution. US prisons went as far as falsified paperwork (even using nonexistent hospital numbers), stockpiling and ‘trading’ drugs with other jurisdictions and more recently crossing state lines to buy drugs with cash from compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies are not subject to quality control scrutiny by the FDA, and they were also behind last year’s major outbreak of meningitis from contaminated drugs. 
Like all drugs, lethal injection drugs have expiration dates and require specific handling. If any claims about competence and ‘humaneness’ are to be true the drugs must at least be the drugs chemically and functionally claimed. For this reason transparency of source, handling and qualifications of the execution team are crucial if anything claimed by the state is to be any better than ‘blind faith.’ 
In January the first ‘experiment’ with midazolam and hydromorphone to execute took place in Ohio. The execution went ahead despite testimony by an associate professor of anaesthesia at the Harvard School of Medicine[ii]: 
“Inmate McGuire is at substantial, palpable, objectively intolerable risk of experiencing the agony and horrifying sensation of unrelenting air hunger during the midazolam/ hydromorphone execution under Ohio’s execution protocol.” – Declaration of David Waisel, M.D. 
This prediction bore out after courts flatly ignored the testimony, it took 25 minutes to kill McGuire in front of his children on 16 January 2014. 
Embarrassed by the regular headlines of incompetence and desperate to keep the supply lines open, states have sought to make the sources of their drugs official state secrets along with any information about the execution team or their credentials – the official line of these states is that they want to protect the supplier from unnamed ‘threats’ of abolitionists. One US Federal Court judge took issue with this level of secrecy, pointing out that under such secrecy laws the source of drugs used on an inmate could be “nothing more than a high school chemistry class[iii]” 
 
Joseph Wood’s defence team appealed against the secrecy and received a brief respite (until the US Supreme Court overruled it). He sought transparency on the drug sources and skills of those about to carry out the second ‘execution’ ever to use these drugs. 
McGuire’s execution and many ‘botched executions’ have happened this year and last. The memory is recent and the knowledge well publicised. Dr Waisel’s testimony was so accurate in McGuire’s execution (the only other midazolam and hydromorphone execution ever carried out), that the result in Arizona was entirely predictable. The incompetence of the plans were highlighted not only in the fact that it took nearly two hours to kill Wood, but in the recorded emergency appeal to halt the execution (after the first hour had not killed him), it was revealed that there was absolutely no contingency plan and if there was any ‘medical professional’ on site, they were incompetent to make the diagnosis of ‘brain death’ claimed by the state. 
Before Wednesday’s execution we had the knowledge that lethal injection already has the highest rate of being ‘botched,’ that quality control of drugs and competency of administrators of lethal injection affect the outcome in all cases  and, that this drug combination is already predicted by medical experts and proven in practice to result in horrific pain and torture. This knowledge was not secret in any way. 
One can only conclude that given this knowledge the tortured killing of Joseph Wood was not an accident – it was in fact the very design even if the state did not declare that as the intention. Punishment can never be humane where the death penalty is used.

The violence finally reached the area where I live; where I, my children and neighbours had thought it was safe. 
After I finished the day’s work gathering information on the killing of the young boys in the Shati Refugee camp on the first day of Eid and the killing of the first Palestinian Christian in this war – both close to where I live – I lay on the couch and started watching the TV. There was a blackout, but I had switched on the generator. 
The news helps me capture the bigger picture, because during the day I focus so much on specific cases and details. Soon after I lay down at around 10:30pm, I fell into a deep sleep and the television remote control fell from my hand. I was woken by the sound of a very loud explosion which was followed by many others in quick succession. We are used to the sounds of explosions from Israeli bombings, but these were extremely loud so we knew that it was very close. 
The kids and my other relatives who were displaced and are now staying with me came running to me. I was still stretched on the couch, exhausted. When bombing gets close or when my family is scared they always come to me. They think I can protect them from this or that I am some sort of saviour. Of course in reality, there is nothing that I can do. 
I got up and and found the sky was lit by loud explosions nearby, in Al-Abbas, Ansar, the Shifa hospital area, and Gaza port. Soon afterwards, intense shelling from the Israeli ships and aerial bombings started. The sounds of explosions, glass breaking, and walls falling down was overwhelming. I told the kids and family to run downstairs and hide in the stairwell and try to keep to the eastern side because the naval shelling was coming from the sea in the west. The windows of my house did not break because I had put duct tape in the shape of a cross all over them to reinforce the glass. 
It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. The bombing went on until six in the morning. It only stopped when the sun came out. 
At around 3am the building to the west of my house and the building in front of it were hit with missiles fired by planes. 
The explosions were a mix of naval shelling and aerial bombings 
My family and the neighbours panicked and people started leaving their houses, not knowing where to go. My family was asking me whether we should leave the building and the neighbours were also shouting at us to leave, but where could we go? I told everyone that we should stay put. Imagine if we left, towards Shifa hospital, which was bombed yesterday but is still considered the safest place in the Gaza Strip. To get there we would need to walk in a big group with children and keep close to walls. The drones may not see we are a fleeing family, and we could easily be bombed. I made it clear to everyone that we have nowhere to go and that we should remain under the stairs at the bottom of the building. 
Some neighbours made it to Shifa hospital and they told us the next day just how crowded it was. I thought of the people who were forced to leave their homes in Shuja’iya and other neighbourhoods – they are now living without shelter or any support. I thought that soon I may be like them. But I did not share that with my family. 
We spent eight hours hiding in the same place. Every once in a while one of us would go to make tea or coffee to pass the time. But the atmosphere was frenetic; my children would be laughing like crazy at one point and then break down crying a moment later. At one point my young daughter Huda started shivering and her body was as cold as ice; it was as if someone threw her into ice-cold water. Other kids started crying too. 
The scariest part was when they bombed the media building. During bombing raids, we rely on the radio news, which we listen to on our cell phones, providing a life-line to the outside world. Without it, there is only the sound of the bombs. We were listening to Al-Aqsa radio, but then it stopped after it was hit. We switched to other stations but they all went off the air, one after the other. That was the most worrying thing for me because it made me feel that I lost what little control I had over the situation. 
We remained in silence except for the sound of bombing, which after a couple of hours becomes a background noise you get used to, like that of the generator or the fridge. 
False news began to circulate, creating panic and confusion. Now, with the electricity also completely out, we were in complete darkness. I could have turned on the generator but I needed to hear the war planes and the drones to know how close they were. 
At 6am when the bombing stopped I went downstairs to check on my car and the surrounding area. I was worried that my car was damaged because, believe it or not, the insurance in Gaza does not cover damage from war. This is crazy; we have war all the time. 
I found a large crater in the middle of the street caused by what seemed like shelling from the sea. It was scarily close to our house. I then went on to check on my neighbour’s home and found the roof had been penetrated by a missile. It was the same for another two neighbours’ homes. 
By bombing our neighbourhood they are sending a message that there really is nowhere safe in Gaza. I realised that, at any moment, my neighbourhood could turn into Shuja’iya – reduced to rubble by the bombs. 
After doing a quick check of the neighbourhood I went home and slept for a couple of hours. Then I got up, took a cold shower, and set off to work again as if nothing had happened. This is life in Gaza, terror at night and massacres in the day. You get used to this; you have no choice. 
I do my work during the day and do not think about the night until it comes, otherwise I will remain worried. What is important is that my family and I all wake up safe. In any case, we have nowhere to go; we can only remain in my home. 
A sense of purpose amid the peril	At least feel like I have a purpose during the hardship, and this is what keeps me going. 
I need to keep focused on documenting human rights violations and reporting on them – to get the truth about what’s happening in Gaza out to the world. I feel like I have a duty to serve, not only Gaza, but the whole of humanity.

Across the city of Ramallah in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) hang billboards and banners showing images of bloodshed and destruction alongside the words: “Here now, we are all Gaza”. 
Many of these posters, which I also saw hanging in other cities across the West Bank, are sponsored by the Palestinian Authority institutions. In Ramallah, the local municipality also recently hosted a demonstration where people carried dozens of empty coffins wrapped in Palestinian flags to represent the rising numbers of people killed in Gaza since the launch of Israel’s military operation there on 8 July. The procession was led by the local governor and other officials. 
In contrast with the past seven years or so, West Bank solidarity with Gaza seems to be stronger. During the 2008/09 and 2012 Israeli military operations in Gaza, a solidarity demonstration would gather maybe a couple of dozen or fewer people in a handful of locations. Today, hundreds are protesting on an almost daily basis in cities and villages across the West Bank. 
On 24 July the West Bank saw its largest single demonstration in years, when thousands marched from Ramallah towards Jerusalem to protest against the Israeli attacks on Gaza. The demonstration was quickly met with excessive force by Israeli forces when it reached Qalandia military checkpoint. At least one demonstrator was killed and many others were severely injured by live gunfire ammunition. 
The next day there were protests and clashes in dozens of locations across the West Bank. Five more people, including a child, were killed by Israeli forces. Among them was Hashem Abu Maria, 47, a human rights defender who worked for Defence for Children International – Palestine. An Israeli soldier shot him in the chest with live gunfire ammunition during a demonstration in the village of Beit Ummar on 25 July. 
A group of Palestinian activists have been producing daily maps that show locations where demonstrations and protests have taken place since the beginning of July. A quick scan through them quickly reveals how strongly West Bank residents have reacted to the latest Israeli military operation in Gaza. But while this reaction may have been empowered by recent efforts to reconcile rival Palestinian parties, it is far from being a result of Palestinian Authority policies and practices. 
The protest movement here has been slowly growing for years, and has remained steadfast in the face of brutal Israeli repression. It has also been undeterred by the Palestinian Authority’s attacks on freedom of expression and assembly. Even with the official show of solidarity with Gaza, the Palestinian Authority security forces have thwarted demonstrations – sometimes using excessive force – in areas under their control, especially those marching towards Israeli checkpoints, military structures, or settlements. 
The protest movement comes after years of different groups and communities demonstrating against the Israeli military occupation and the expansion of unlawful settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. It is today moved by rage that has grown from decades of living under that occupation. 
Days before Israel levelled whole neighbourhoods in Gaza, the homes of three men suspected of carrying out attacks against Israelis in the West Bank were blown up, rendering them completely uninhabitable. When I visited one of the homes in Hebron that had been destroyed, a relative told me: “I am ashamed to speak of my terror or the demolition of my home when I see how Israel is bombing entire families while they are still inside their houses in Gaza. I am not worried that my home is demolished, I am worried about my people in Gaza.” 
The worries, the pain, and the anger of the Palestinians in the West Bank and those in Gaza are the same. The family in Hebron is a victim of collective punishment, a violation of international law. Collective punishment is also what thousands of families in Gaza have suffered during seven years of Israel’s unlawful closure and blockade of the territory. 
People in the West Bank have long declared that “we are all Gaza,” an affirmation that the pain, suffering and loss due to decades of Israeli military occupation are shared by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza alike. They suffer violations of human rights and international humanitarian law on a daily basis and in different shapes and forms – from home demolitions, illegal settlements, and unlawful killings to the bombardment of civilian homes and infrastructure and the crippling siege on Gaza. 
The time has come for the international community to act on all these issues. A special responsibility lies with the USA and the European Union, who have influence over Israel. They must act immediately to suspend all arms transfers to Israel and support an arms embargo on all weapons going to all sides in the conflict to make clear that they will not facilitate unlawful killing of civilians and other serious violations. 
Equally important, they must take concrete steps to end Israel’s military blockade of Gaza and ensure accountability and respect for international law is a top priority for all sides. The Palestinian Authority should also do its part to ensure accountability for serious violations by acceding to the Rome Statute and therefore joining the International Criminal Court.

0,The flight from Mosul: “We left everything behind to save our lives”,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-the-flight-from-mosul-we-left-everything-behind-to-save-our-lives/,"By Donatella Rovera, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International.

His life and that of his family were turned upside down last week, when members of the Islamic State (ISIS) turned up at their home in Mosul, northern Iraq. 
The ISIS militants who now control the city gave Marvin, his elderly parents and his brother and sister four stark choices: convert to Islam, pay jizya (a tax for non-Muslims), leave the city … or have their heads cut off. The militants then painted the Arabic letter “N” (for nasrani or Christian) on the house. 
For Marvin’s family, like many other Christian residents of Mosul, there was no choice. They took a few belongings and left the city early the following morning. “On our way out of Mosul, ISIS took our money and jewellery. Now we have no means to get out of Iraq and nothing to go back to in Mosul because our lives there have been destroyed,” Marvin told Amnesty International. 
In recent weeks, Marvin’s story has become tragically common among Christians and other civilians in Mosul. 
Abu Yussef’s family was also similarly forced to leave after they found the letter “N” painted on their house. He and his wife, Hanaa, took their child and a few belongings and fled to Qaraqosh, a mainly Christian town 30 minutes east of Mosul under the control of the Kurdish peshmerga forces which are preventing ISIS from advancing further east. 
Hanaa was a doctor in a health centre in Mosul before ISIS stormed the city. She said: “We left everything behind to save our lives. Our children are now so scared they wake up crying in the night. We want to leave Iraq for the future of our children. Life has become impossible here. All we built has gone and we cannot live our lives again in Mosul. ISIS has stolen our lives.” 
For weeks before Christians had been fearing that their future in Mosul would be threatened. When I visited the city two weeks after the ISIS takeover on 10 June, threats and attacks against the Christian community were already on the rise. Many had fled, along with members of other religious and ethnic communities. 
Many of the city’s residents told me about their fears, though some tried to remain hopeful—partly because the likely prospects were too awful to contemplate. Many argued that ISIS had taken advantage of the grievances of the majority Sunni population against the sectarian and repressive rule of the central government but that it could not remain in control of the city and impose its brutal rule on a population of close to two million. 
They believed that while ISIS’ takeover of Mosul and other areas had not been opposed—and had even been supported –by powerful Sunni tribes and other groups which used to enjoy power as part of the Baath party of the late dictator, Saddam Hussein, these groups would keep ISIS at bay. Yet it was clear that life in Mosul was becoming too dangerous for Christians and other non-Sunni communities, as well as for Sunni Muslims opposed to ISIS. 
ISIS militants had taken down a statue of the Virgin Mary from the top of one of Mosul’s churches, a clear sign that worse was to come for the Christian community. As clashes broke out between Mosul-based militants and Kurdish peshmerga on the eastern outskirts of the city on the evening of 25 June, the entire population of the nearby Christian town of Qaraqosh fled in panic.	Some had already fled from Mosul and were sheltering there. It was their second terrifying displacement in two weeks. 
In al-Qosh, two hours north of Mosul, Lara, a mother of four young children, told me: “We left Mosul with nothing, thinking it was just for a few days. Now we are fleeing again and I don’t see how we could go back home. I don’t have another home, I don’t have another country. What will the future be for us?” 
  
ISIS now controls a vast area of north-west Iraq, all the way to and across the Syrian border. And it is replicating in Iraq the extreme brutality of its rule in the parts of Syria it controls. 
Its capacity to terrorise the civilian population has been greatly enhanced by the weapons it captured in the areas it took over—weapons supplied in 2003 to the Iraqi central government by the US-led multinational force, which failed to ensure that the mechanisms were in place to avoid such a not-so-unlikely eventuality. 
It is now the responsibility of the international community—notably members of the “coalition of the willing” which marched into Iraq without a UN mandate just over a decade ago—to step up to the challenge. They must urgently assist the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who have been forced from their homes and whose lives have been destroyed. 
For people like Marvin, Abu Yussef, Hanaa, Lara and thousands of others, the prospect of surviving without any assistance is just too terrifying to contemplate.

I ignored the sound. Drones circle overhead all the time; you never know whether it’s just for surveillance or an impending missile launch. The uncertainty makes you feel helpless. What can anyone do? 
Five minutes later, a missile fired from what sounded like an F-16 fighter jet struck nearby. The loud boom sent the children running to me. They crowded in the bathroom, for comfort and safety. They looked so frightened and pale; their eyes red from lack of sleep. I am known for keeping a cool head, people say I have nerves of steel, so, typically, I just smiled at them – still clutching my toothbrush. The relief of seeing me smile made them break down in giggles; it’s one of those absurd reactions you have under extreme stress. 
Overall, I try to keep things as normal as possible for them; we don’t talk about the war and deaths all the time. We take rational precautions but we don’t overdo it and try to avoid sowing panic. We don’t shout “go downstairs, go downstairs!” each time there’s a drone buzzing. 
My home feels relatively safe, because I know my neighbours in the building and around me, and I know there is no one who could be a target. Yet nowhere in Gaza is truly safe. Life is dangerous. It’s war. We trust in God and look after the children. 
I try to stay away from the areas where the fighting is taking place; in any case the Israeli military has made them off-limits. No vehicle is immune from attack. Just the other day a drone strike destroyed a clearly marked ambulance. 
It’s when I am out taking photos and interviewing people who live in the areas being targeted that I am most at risk. The danger is when you feel that every house you are in could be targeted next. But I believe my work is important – regardless of the danger, it’s essential for the truth to come out.	Last week the case of the Abu Jame’ family in eastern Khan Yunis shook me to the core. Twenty-five members of one family had been wiped out in an Israeli airstrike just as they were eating Iftar, the evening meal to break the Ramadan fast. I arrived on the scene the following morning, just a few hours after the blast. They were pulling out the bodies all night. So many little ones. While I was there, another missile struck nearby. 
At the moment, there are 28 people living in my house. My brothers normally live in Salatin in the northern Gaza Strip, where the Israeli ground invasion is going on. My three brothers with their families of about six or seven children each, and my children are all living together under one roof. I let them all stay with me; you can’t refuse when there are lives at stake. 
The Israeli ground invasion has made it impossible to get food into Gaza City from the agricultural areas in the north. From the south the main Salah al-Din road that links the whole Gaza Strip is very exposed and comes under frequent drone attacks. At the moment only ambulances and a few humanitarian vehicles use it, at great risk. 
The only market that is still functioning is the one in al-Shati Refugee Camp, which opens at night and gets very crowded. The stall-holders must risk their lives to get fresh vegetables. It is a dense area and if an F-16 bombed it the whole camp would become a crater. The few shops that remain open have run out of most stock. 
We have electricity for about four to six hours every day, at different times.  When the electricity is on we rush to charge all our mobile phones. A second-hand electricity generator costs 1,400 shekels [equivalent to approximately US$400], so not many can afford it. With no power, we have to pump up the water to the storage tanks on the roof – and that’s just to get water in the taps for washing. We have to buy clean water for cooking and drinking. 
I have a desk with everything I need to work – computers, chargers, internet, cameras… but no electricity. I just managed to fix my old diesel generator and I got fuel for it today. Hopefully tonight it will work. I really need it, so that I can send the outside world testimonies and photos I have gathered… I feel under pressure to get the stories out of Gaza, so it’s incredibly frustrating when there is a blackout.

The journey was not without its challenges and delights. As they went up the mountain, it seemed as though every day they were walking through a different country. Beginning in a lush rainforest, they climbed through tall heather and moorlands, until they eventually come across a high-altitude alpine desert. As they continued up to the summit, where temperatures plummeted to -15C, it was as though they had stepped into the Antarctica. 
,  
	Their 6-10 hour hikes each day brought lots of physical challenges as a result of the altitude; headaches, sore throats, runny or bleeding noses.  But the most difficult day by far was summit day, when they woke up at midnight and began trekking at 1 am. To reach the summit, they had to trek for 6 hours. As their water bottles turn to ice and dehydration started to set in, they were overwhelmed by a feeling of fatigue and cold that made them want to stop within the first hour. But they trekked on, determined to complete the journey.

	Upon reaching the summit, Adam experienced a feeling unlike any other. It was as though he had achieved something so great that could never be taken away from him. The climb down was almost just as arduous, and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro was many times more difficult than he had expected.

Like many other large-scale resource development projects, Northern Gateway has another critical dimension that is often overlooked. Northern Gateway is also a human rights issue because of the risk that it could further undermine the ability of First Nations families and communities to practice their cultures and pursue traditional livelihoods. 
Amnesty International isn’t opposed to all resource development or pipeline construction, but we have said that Northern Gateway should not go ahead. As international human rights bodies have long recognized, a high standard of precaution is essential in any decision that could compound the harms that have already been inflicted on Indigenous peoples. The federal government, which gave conditional approval for Northern Gateway in a decision announced in June, has fallen far short of this standard of precaution. 
	Northern Gateway is intended to transport a daily average of 525,000 barrels of oil sands bitumen between Alberta and the British Columbia coast. If the project goes ahead, it would lead to pipeline construction across roughly 1000 rivers and streams in the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples in Alberta and British Columbia and the transport of bitumen and industrial chemicals through these territories and through coastal waters vital to other Indigenous nations. Northern Gateway would also contribute to increased demand for oil sands extraction on Indigenous lands in Alberta. 
	Through our long history of work in collaboration with the Lubicon Cree of Northern Alberta, Amnesty International has seen the devastating harm to Indigenous peoples’ cultures, economies and well-being when governments ignore their rights in pursuit of resource development. While the Northern Gateway proposal was being debated, we also had a chance to meet with many First Nations leaders, activists and community members along the proposed pipeline route through British Columbia. We heard first hand both about the continued vital importance of salmon fishing and other traditional livelihoods. We also heard about the long, hard struggle these communities have endured as they try to recover from the harms inflicted on them by pas government decisions and policies, including the residential school programme. 
Many First Nations whose traditional lands would be crossed by the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline have strongly opposed the pipeline, as have First Nations who depend on the downstream rivers and coastal waters. Although lengthy public hearings were held into the project, the mandate of this review excluded some of the key issues leading First Nations to oppose the project, including the cumulative impacts of the many projects already underway or planned for the region and the right of Indigenous peoples to make their own decisions about their traditional lands should be used and developed. 
	During the environmental assessment process, the federal government told the panel that it would carry out further consultations with First Nations on Indigenous rights issues beyond the mandate of the review. It never did. 
	When the federal government announced its approval of the project, 23 First Nations issued a public statement saying that they would challenge the decision in court. They have solid grounds for doing so. 
	Canadian courts have clearly said that governments have a mandatory, Constitutional duty to carry out meaningful, good faith consultations with Indigenous peoples when considering any decision that could have an impact on their rights – even when these rights are still in dispute. The federal government’s persistent failure to comply with the Indigenous rights protections set out by our own courts is another form of discrimination against Indigenous peoples. 
	Amnesty International believes that the government’s decision to approve Northern Gateway also falls far short of international legal standards. As the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples said during his visit to Canada in 2013, as a general rule the appropriate standard for large-scale resource development projects is to proceed only with free, prior and informed consent of the affected Indigenous peoples. The standard of consent is set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and has long been applied by international human rights bodies in interpreting the binding legal standard of human rights conventions. 
	Free, prior and informed consent is also gaining ground as a best practice among many sectors of industry and investment. The federal government’s decision to approve Northern Gateway over the express opposition of First Nations has not only laid the foundation for a protracted legal battle in Canada, it also squandered an opportunity to support a vital standard of human rights protection that is gaining ground around the world.

We spent a morning at an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) site on the grounds of a private school in Juba, where close to 5,000 people are sheltered. More than one million people have been internally displaced in South Sudan over the course of the past seven months as violence and massive human rights violations swept through the capital Juba and Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile states. There was considerable displacement within Juba itself. Approximately 30,000 IDPs are living in sites on two UN peacekeeping bases there. The others have had to find places to live throughout the city. 
Some have turned to friends, close family and distant relatives. Many have settled into sites that have sprung up relatively spontaneously across the city. That is the case for the women, men and children who have taken shelter on the grounds of Mahad School. The school’s owner, faced with the desperate needs of so many people with nowhere to go, did not hesitate to allow them to stay. For how long, no one knows. 
Unlike the camps on the UN bases, home almost entirely to members of the Nuer ethnic group, several different ethnic groups have found shelter and are living together at the Mahad School site. That includes the Dinka, Murle, Shilluk and Anyuak. 
While the current conflict has largely pitted Dinka and Nuer against each other, there is recent history of conflict between the Dinka and the Murle, including political discord and armed clashes over the past two years in the state of Jonglei. Many of the Murle we interviewed at Mahad had initially fled from Jonglei to Juba in 2012 and 2013 because of insecurity there, only to find themselves caught up in the wave of atrocities unleashed in Juba in mid-December. 
Mary, a Murle woman, had come to Juba from Pibor, in Jonglei, in June 2013. Her husband had been killed during the war that led to South Sudan’s independence. She was left to raise six children on her own. Two of those children were with her when fighting began in Juba during the night of 15/16 December. And very quickly the neighbourhood where she was residing came under attack by what seemed to be a combination of Dinka soldiers and police, along with armed civilians. Even though she had been fearful of attacks from Nuer fighters when she had lived in Pibor, she now found herself fleeing alongside Nuer neighbours. 
Mary and her two children began to run. She had not made it far, however, when her 14-year-old son was shot and then hacked to death with machetes, only a few metres in front of her. But she had to keep running. Her 16-year-old daughter was with her, and they would have been helpless in the face of the armed gang that had set upon her son. She told me that she has never seen his body. There was a long pause before she felt able to continue with the rest of our interview. 
If ever there would be reason to harbour hate and ethnic animosity, this would be it. 
But as we finished talking, we were joined by Ayor, a Dinka woman whom I had interviewed earlier. There was clearly warmth and friendship between the two women. I had taken Ayor’s photo earlier, so she knew I had a camera. With great animation she insisted that I needed to take a photo of Mary and her together. Just as I readied to snap the picture, they joined hands. 
There was much energetic back and forth between the two women and my translator at that point. The upshot that was shared with me was this: It starts right here. If we cannot put the hatred and distrust aside, here where we face the same problems and worries and where we have nothing; if we cannot put all of that aside here then there is no hope for this nation. We are not enemies; we are sisters. And we are ready to reach out to our Nuer sisters also. 
They went on to tell me that they were making a concerted effort to learn each other’s languages; and that more widely most people in the camp were trying to learn the languages of one or two other ethnic groups. They viewed that as one of the most powerful ways to start to bring down the “walls of misunderstanding” that lead to violence. As they talked their hands remained clasped. 
There is a lot that needs to happen in South Sudan: to better meet humanitarian needs, restore security, and take steps to prevent a repeat of the human rights crisis that has devastated the country. 
As a first step towards restoring security, the international community needs to ramp up the pressure on both sides of the current conflict to live up to the ceasefire they have agreed to. 
In a country already awash in arms and with more shipments arriving, there needs to be a comprehensive global arms embargo. 
With conditions in IDP sites now both insecure and unhealthy, there is a desperate need for creative solutions to the country’s crisis of displacement. 
	Against a backdrop of decades of impunity that has fueled one massacre after another, this time there must be justice and accountability for the widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity that have been committed. 
All of that, yes. But at the end of the day is there anything more important than Mary and Ayor’s dream; joining hands across the divisions of distrust, grievance and loss that have fueled so much conflict in South Sudan? 
It starts right there.

The court case was initiated by Grassy Narrows trappers whose traplines were threatened by clearcut logging licensed by the Ontario government. 
In the original trial decision, an Ontario court concluded that – because of the terms of the Treaty and the particular history of the region – only the federal government, not the provincial government, has the authority to make decisions about development on the portion of the Grassy Narrows traditional territory called the Keewatin area. 
The Supreme Court rejected this argument, concluding instead that the powers of the Crown to “take up” Treaty lands applied to the provincial government. 
However, the Court also stated that the legal obligations and restrictions on Crown powers resulting from the Treaty must also apply to the province. 
The Court stated, “The promises made in Treaty 3 were promises of the Crown, not those of Canada. Both levels of government are responsible for fulfilling these promises when acting within the division of powers under the Constitution Act, 1867.” 
The Supreme Court ruling goes on to state that “the harvesting rights of the Ojibway over the land must be respected” and that any decisions by the province to permit logging or other development of the land must fulfill the standard of consultation and accommodation of Indigenous rights and interests that is now well-established in Canadian law. 
This question of whether the province’s decisions to allow clear-cut logging at Grassy Narrows weres consistent with these legal obligations has not yet been addressed by the courts. 
The Grassy Narrows First Nation has consistently opposed clear-cut logging in its traditional territory as incompatible with the ability of the community to hunt, trap, gather berries and carry out other traditional activities on the land. The culture and economy of Grassy Narrows has already been severely impacted by environmental contamination and other harms caused by federal and provincial policies. 
In a statement released today, the Grassy Narrows Chief and Council stated, “Grassy Narrows is deeply committed to protecting the way of life of our people, upholding the rights guaranteed in Treaty 3 and providing a bright future for our members and we will continue to resist the expansion of unsustainable industrial logging in our territory.” 
Amnesty International has taken the position that there should be no clear-cut logging or other large-scale industrial development at Grassy Narrows against the wishes of the people of Grassy Narrows. We believe that the province must meet this standard of free, prior and informed consent to fulfill the legal obligations affirmed in today’s Supreme Court decision. 
Today’s decision is all the more reason why pressure must be maintained on the provincial government to live up to its human rights obligations to the people of Grassy Narrows.

Ten days before our meeting, the 19-year-old was barely recognizable: the skin on his face stretched tight, swollen and bruised. Abducted and tortured, Sasha believes he is lucky to be alive. 
After the city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine came under control of separatist armed groups in April 2014, he was an obvious target. 
Sasha was part of a “self-defence team” which came together to protect pro-Ukrainian activists during clashes with anti-Kyiv counter-protesters in Luhansk’s streets. There were hardly any police officers present, and those who were there did nothing to protect the demonstrators. 
He proudly shows us a photo on his mobile phone of a young man wearing a balaclava on the “frontline” of the protests. “That’s me,” he boasts. 
This is undoubtedly the reason he was targeted. 
Sasha believes another member of the self-defence group turned him in. He called Sasha, saying he had just returned from Kyiv and had some news he needed to discuss. Sasha agreed to meet outside the block of flats where he lived, at around 8pm that evening. But when he arrived, his friend was not there. Instead, a group of armed men leapt out from parked cars, shooting in the air and yelling at Sasha to lie on the ground. 
“First of all I tried to run away, it was a shock,” he says. “I didn’t understand what was happening and I didn’t know who these people were. I started to run but they shot near my legs. I lay on the ground because there was no-where to run. Then they started to hit me in the head with guns. They kicked and punched me, cuffed me and took me to the car.” 
Some of the men searched Sasha’s flat, while he remained in the car where he was repeatedly punched and kicked until they returned. From there he was blindfolded and taken to the Ukrainian Security Service building, which the armed group had taken over. In a room on the second floor, he was questioned about his role in the protests. His captors demanded the addresses of other activists and details about the Ukrainian military. They even accused him of being in the pay of America. 
“There were a lot of people, first of all they started to punch me. They punched me in the face… on my arms and legs. They made no secret of it; they told me that they were going to kill me. After half hour, 40 minutes – you stop feeling the pain. I started to lose myself, I lost consciousness,” he tells us. 
Sasha says when he passed out he was dumped in a basement. Every time he regained consciousness, he was taken upstairs for questioning again. Each time, the severity of the torture increased. 
He describes how he was beaten with anything they could find, including a chair, flayed with plastic hoses and choked. He describes how they attached cables to his wrists and electrocuted him. Then he shows us a deep scab on his inner thigh. There is a hole the size of a fingertip. 
“They took the cigarettes, they were stubbing cigarettes in my leg, and then [they] stubbed another cigarette in that hole… How can do this to other people? It’s not normal,” he implores as he points to the healing wound. 
Sasha says he was tortured repeatedly for 24 hours, and taken to the second floor room around a dozen times. Finally he was dumped again in the basement. 
“I was lying in the basement when the door opened and one guy put a gun to my head and said to go straight to the corridor – and don’t say anything. While I was walking through the corridor, the armed people who were there, they told me ‘goodbye – they are going to kill you’,” he says. 
“I thought only one [thing]: I’m dying for nothing. I’m not dying like a hero of Ukraine, I’m not dying for something I did – I’m dying for nothing.” 
But they didn’t shoot Sasha. Through the family’s network of friends his father made contact with his abductors. Within three hours he had to raise US$60,000 to save his son. 
Sasha was driven to a disused building in a park. He was told to sit on a window ledge and not to move or he would be shot by a sniper. It was there that his father found him. He eased his son into the car and drove immediately to the railway station. There he put Sasha, still wearing his blood-stained clothes, into a compartment on a train bound for Kyiv and said goodbye. 
Sasha now shares a room with his mother on the outskirts of the capital in a run-down apartment block. He is desperate to find work, not only to pay the rent, but to pay back the family and friends who raised his ransom. 
“Now I’m living in another city. I lost everything, I lost my flat, I lost my car, every single thing I had. I have to find a job, all I have is my passport in my pocket. I need money to pay for this flat and I need to pay money to the people in Luhansk who gave money to my family. Sixty thousand dollars!” he says with an air of desperation. 
There is nothing that can justify the beatings and other torture Sasha endured following his abduction. What is saddening, is not just his material loss, but the steeling effect his ordeal has had on his resolve. There is anger in his eyes when we ask him of his future. 
“I will go back to Luhansk – and continue the war,” he says.

As her boyfriend Feodor lifted the latch, seven armed men wearing balaclavas and camouflaged fatigues barged through. They said they were from the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR), the pro-Russian separatist group which had recently seized power in the city. 
This was the start of a terrifying six day ordeal for the 30 year old pro-Ukrainian activist. She had been involved in demonstrations providing medical help and first aid to protesters injured in clashes. 
As the gunmen searched Hanna’s flat, she knew she was in trouble when they found a Ukrainian flag and pro-Kyiv leaflets. She and Feodor were marched down the stairs, blind-folded and bundled into a waiting car. They were taken to the Department for Crime Control for questioning. 
Hanna describes how, held in a small basement, a middle aged man led the interrogation. She was accused of being a member of a far right group. They looked for tattoos of the numbers 38 or 39 associated with fascist groups 
“There were crazy assumptions… the situation was dreadful. How can a person can be held for groundless accusations? It’s like the world was inside out.” 
Hanna says that she was questioned about the EuroMaydan protests, about her participation and asked for details of journalists and civil society activists. The consequences of refusing to cooperate were dire. 
“They said ‘you are going to tell us everything – unless you do this you are not going to be freed. And even if you do, you are not necessarily getting out from here’.” 
Small, slightly built and quietly spoken, Hanna nervously recounted her story to us in a shabby medical storeroom on the ground floor of the local hospital in Kyiv. She fled to the city after her release and now helps out distributing medical supplies and helping others escaping the violence in eastern Ukraine. The shelves are stacked with medical supplies – drugs and bandages – all donated to help those, like her, arriving with injuries from torture suffered at the hands of armed groups in eastern Ukraine. 
As we asked what happened to her, she looks to the floor with a sense of disbelief. She told us that after half an hour of questioning, her interrogator turned to violence. 
“My face was smashed – he punched me in the face with his fist, he was trying to beat me everywhere, I was covering myself with my hands… I was huddled in the corner, curled up in a ball with my hands around my knees. He was angry that I was trying to protect myself. He went out and came back with a knife.” 
Hanna showed us the scars on her neck, arms and legs where she was sliced with the blade: there is a stab wound in her knee, her right index finger is still heavily bandaged in a plastic splint. She describes how, as she was trying to protect herself, the blade sliced off the skin of her finger, “peeling it like an orange”. 
“I was in shock, so I didn’t feel any pain, but you look at these cuts and you think that it’s not you. It was sick. Your own countrymen interrogating you with such cruelty. I was lost, I was so worried, I thought it was the end… I thought I might be killed… At the end of the interrogation [he said] “Pray now – I’m going to kill you”, and then he slit [the back of] my neck with the knife.” 
Not only did Hanna have to endure the agony of the violent beating, but she says her interrogator was intent on humiliating her too, trying to crush her spirit. He made her write a pro-Russian slogan on the wall, in her own blood. 
“He said: write with your blood on the wall ‘I love Donbass’, and if you can’t do this, if you run out of blood, I will shoot you. So I had this open wound with skin flapping off, I took the blood from the wound and wrote with my left hand on the wall… When someone points a gun at you and says I’m going to kill you – and there’s nothing you can do – you think it’s going to happen.” 
Hanna says her torturous ordeal stopped following an order from higher up the chain of command. She was held for a further six days before being sent to the city of Dnipropetrovsk as part of a “prisoner exchange”. Prior to leaving she was allowed to call her parents. 
“I wanted just to be back home, just to get back to life as normal and to imagine that this was just a nightmare… I was very upset because I hadn’t seen my family. They let us call, so I rang them and told them that I was alive, and that I was leaving…. Obviously I wanted to go home, but I couldn’t.” 
Hanna has still not seen her parents. She is trying to rebuild her life anew, but her future, just like Ukraine’s, is far from certain.

This was the start of a terrifying six day ordeal for the 30 year old pro-Ukrainian activist. She had been involved in demonstrations providing medical help and first aid to protesters injured in clashes. 
,  
As the gunmen searched Hanna’s flat, she knew she was in trouble when they found a Ukrainian flag and pro-Kyiv leaflets. She and Feodor were marched down the stairs, blind-folded and bundled into a waiting car. They were taken to the Department for Crime Control for questioning. 
,  
Hanna describes how, held in a small basement, a middle aged man led the interrogation. She was accused of being a member of a far right group. They looked for tattoos of the numbers 38 or 39 associated with fascist groups 
,  
“There were crazy assumptions… the situation was dreadful. How can a person can be held for groundless accusations? It’s like the world was inside out.” 
,  
Hanna says that she was questioned about the EuroMaydan protests, about her participation and asked for details of journalists and civil society activists. The consequences of refusing to cooperate were dire. 
,  
“They said ‘you are going to tell us everything – unless you do this you are not going to be freed. And even if you do, you are not necessarily getting out from here’.” 
,  
Small, slightly built and quietly spoken, Hanna nervously recounted her story to us in a shabby medical storeroom on the ground floor of the local hospital in Kyiv. She fled to the city after her release and now helps out distributing medical supplies and helping others escaping the violence in eastern Ukraine. The shelves are stacked with medical supplies – drugs and bandages – all donated to help those, like her, arriving with injuries from torture suffered at the hands of armed groups in eastern Ukraine. 
,  
As we asked what happened to her, she looks to the floor with a sense of disbelief. She told us that after half an hour of questioning, her interrogator turned to violence. 
,  
“My face was smashed – he punched me in the face with his fist, he was trying to beat me everywhere, I was covering myself with my hands… I was huddled in the corner, curled up in a ball with my hands around my knees. He was angry that I was trying to protect myself. He went out and came back with a knife.” 
,  
Hanna showed us the scars on her neck, arms and legs where she was sliced with the blade: there is a stab wound in her knee, her right index finger is still heavily bandaged in a plastic splint. She describes how, as she was trying to protect herself, the blade sliced off the skin of her finger, “peeling it like an orange”. 
,  
“I was in shock, so I didn’t feel any pain, but you look at these cuts and you think that it’s not you. It was sick. Your own countrymen interrogating you with such cruelty. I was lost, I was so worried, I thought it was the end… I thought I might be killed… At the end of the interrogation [he said] “Pray now – I’m going to kill you”, and then he slit [the back of] my neck with the knife.” 
,  
Not only did Hanna have to endure the agony of the violent beating, but she says her interrogator was intent on humiliating her too, trying to crush her spirit. He made her write a pro-Russian slogan on the wall, in her own blood. 
,  
“He said: write with your blood on the wall ‘I love Donbass’, and if you can’t do this, if you run out of blood, I will shoot you. So I had this open wound with skin flapping off, I took the blood from the wound and wrote with my left hand on the wall… When someone points a gun at you and says I’m going to kill you – and there’s nothing you can do – you think it’s going to happen.” 
,  
Hanna says her torturous ordeal stopped following an order from higher up the chain of command. She was held for a further six days before being sent to the city of Dnipropetrovsk as part of a “prisoner exchange”. Prior to leaving she was allowed to call her parents. 
,  
“I wanted just to be back home, just to get back to life as normal and to imagine that this was just a nightmare… I was very upset because I hadn’t seen my family. They let us call, so I rang them and told them that I was alive, and that I was leaving…. Obviously I wanted to go home, but I couldn’t.” 
,  
Hanna has still not seen her parents. She is trying to rebuild her life anew, but her future, just like Ukraine’s, is far from certain.

Their story is one that more Canadians need to hear because it can tell us so much about the deeply flawed relationship between the federal government and First Nations. Their story is also important because the people of Shoal Lake have their own solution to some of their most pressing concerns and today, after decades of struggle, that solution is now almost within reach. 
One hundred years ago the Shoal Lake #40 community was relocated as part of the development of the city of Winnipeg’s water supply system.  One of the cruel ironies of life in Shoal Lake is that while water from the lake is piped 150 km to Winnipeg to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people in that city, the people of Shoal Lake #40 must rely on bottled water because they don’t have an adequate drinking water system of their own. 
Critically, however, the lack of safe, clean drinking water is only of the injustices facing the people of Shoal Lake. 
Shoal Lake is so close to the Trans Canada Highway that community members can hear the trucks at night. Despite this, Shoal Lake is remarkably isolated. Construction of the Winnipeg water system turned the point of land on which the community was relocated into an artificial island and this has had a devastating impact on their economy and their safety. 
When I visited the community on Wednesday, I drove through a neighbouring First Nation and then crossed the water to Shoal Lake #40 on a tiny barge run by the community.  In the middle of winter, community members can drive across the ice. But in the weeks on either side of a hard freeze, they pick their way on foot across the often treacherous ice. 
Because the community is isolated in this way, many of the necessities of life, from jobs to groceries to medical care, are all on the other side of the water. The high cost of transporting equipment and supplies to the island is also one of the reasons that a new water treatment facility has not been built, even though for years the federal government said that drinking water for Shoal Lake #40 was a high priority. 
During a public information session organized by Shoal Lake #40 this Wednesday, community members explained that they often had little choice but to cross the water in dangerous conditions, and that has led to the loss of lives and to many terrifying close calls. It has also meant tragic delays in getting patients to hospital and has delayed to police and emergency responders getting to the community. 
Community member Lorne Redsky told the gathering, “Every one of needs water but living on the water takes lives too.” He said, “I’ve lost a lot of family. I’ve lost a lot of friends. Some of them were careless. Some of the were just trying to get home.” 
Sharon Redsky told the gathering, “There’s a huge sacrifice that this community is making so that people in Winnipeg can have clean water.” 
This week’s gathering was held in the latest step in a long struggle to overcome the community’s isolation. Shoal Lake #40 wants a permanent bridge over the aquaduct and an all weather road to connect that bridge to the highway. Such a road would make it easier and safer for community members to go to work and for emergency vehicles to enter the community. It would also reduce barriers to establishing essential services in the community, such as their own water treatment plant, and help develop local businesses and employment opportunities. 
Shoal Lake has already made considerable progress toward what the community calls “Freedom Road.” They are now working with the City of Winnipeg and the Manitoba government and together they have opened a rough winter snow road. Winnipeg and Manitoba have also committed their support for a permanent all weather road. Unfortunately, further progress is now being blocked because the federal government — which has jurisdiction in respect to reserve lands and on-reserve services — has not made a similar commitment. 
The Manitoba government, the City of Winnipeg, the nearby Ontario city of Kenora, the Grand Council of Treaty 3, and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg all sent delegations to this week’s gathering to tour the community and to hear the testimony of community members. The federal government was represented by an empty chair. 
Chief Erwin Redsky said, “We have a solution. We are building the road. We just have one person missing from the room.”

0,What Canada can do for crisis-gripped South Sudan?,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-what-canada-can-do-for-crisis-gripped-south-sudan/,"On the third anniversary of South Sudanese independence, the country is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. Will Canada step up and help?   By Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. Originally published in the Toronto Star. JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — “There is nothing to...","  
JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — 
“There is nothing to celebrate; because you are not independent if you are not free” — that was the understandable response when I asked Peter Koang recently what he felt about upcoming third anniversary, on July 9, of the independence of South Sudan, the world’s newest nation. Peter has been living in an overcrowded site for internally displaced persons on a corner of UN peacekeeping base in Juba, South Sudan for seven months. 
He does not feel free or independent. Because the site is still prone to harassment and attacks from hostile outside forces, the UN keeps the gate closed and locked. And because of fear, most of the residents of the camp, including Peter, never dare venture out. The sad irony is that a site offered up by the UN for protection to civilians fleeing massacres in December 2013 has, for many, become a virtual prison camp. 
It was the right decision to open the gates to women, men and children escaping a terrifying wave of ethnic and political violence in the capital, Juba, and other UN bases around the country. But seven months on, the “protection of civilians” sites on UN bases are but one of the many grave challenges amid a staggering human rights and humanitarian crisis that has betrayed the exhilaration and hope that accompanied independence just three years ago. 
There was a time when Canada was actively engaged with respect to peace diplomacy and human rights advocacy in Sudan. Towards the end of decades of civil war that eventually led to the birth of South Sudan, Canada played a helpful role. It was in part motivated by recognition that there was a special responsibility to do so linked to the presence of Calgary-based oil giant Talisman Energy in Sudan’s conflict-ridden oilfields at the time. 
But that was then. More recently Canada has all but walked away from Sudan and South Sudan. A high-level task force that integrated Canada’s engagement with the two countries across government departments was quietly disbanded last year. 
That can change. Significantly boosting diplomatic efforts to help end South Sudan’s deepening human rights crisis is exactly the right place to start. 
Fighting within the country’s Presidential Guard erupted between soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and those backing former Vice President Riek Machar, a Nuer, late at night on Dec. 15, 2013. Within hours the fighting had spilled out of the barracks, across Juba and then throughout the country. Whatever political dispute had provoked the outbreak of violence, it quickly descended into ethnic conflict. 
The toll has been devastating. No one has been able to accurately tally the numbers killed. In January the International Crisis Group suggested it had been 10,000 in the first few weeks. That was six months ago and no other estimates have been offered up since. Close to 400,000 South Sudanese have fled into neighbouring countries as refugees; while 1.1 million remain internally displaced and extremely vulnerable within the country. Some 100,000 South Sudanese are protected (and essentially trapped) on UN bases — an unprecedented move in decades of UN peacekeeping around the world. 
Both sides have deliberately killed civilians; executed captured fighters; abducted and sexually assaulted women and girls; arbitrarily detained civilians, some of whose whereabouts remain unknown; burned down homes; stolen public and private property; and looted food stores and humanitarian aid. Médecins Sans Frontières has condemned systematic attacks against health care by both sides, including killings of patients and health care workers in hospitals and other health care facilities. 
A crisis indeed. 
The UN Security Council is engaged — responsible for the peacekeeping mission. The African Union is engaged — looking at options for justice and accountability. And a regional body, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, is engaged — taking the lead on peace talks. 
But progress is stalled. 
Instead, I’ve heard fear at every turn. Earlier this week a woman described watching her 14-year-old son, fleeing just ahead of her, be struck down by bullets and then hacked to death with a machete. She said that she could not imagine what would ever make her feel safe again. 
It is time for some more concrete steps in that direction — to restore safety. 
Despite all of the attention at every level of the international community, there is no arms embargo in place against South Sudan. Given the scale of war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out with small arms and other weapons that most certainly do not originate inside the country, it is time to cut off the flow of arms into South Sudan. Canada could lead that effort, working closely with other countries to push the Security Council to impose a comprehensive ban on arms transfers to either side of the conflict. 
Sadly, an arms embargo would be one of the best anniversary gifts we could offer to the people of South Sudan. A step toward feeling safe again.

	On 9 July, South Sudan will mark three years as an independent state. But the growing pains of the world’s newest country are evident as millions are trapped in a vicious cycle of violence. Amnesty International’s Elizabeth Ashamu Deng looks at some of the problems facing South Sudan today.	  
 
The situation is catastrophic. Both government and opposition forces engaged in the fighting have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave human rights violations and abuses. 
Thousands of people, many of them civilians, have died over the past six months. 
South Sudan: Facts at a Glance 
				• Became an independent state on 9 July 2011 
• President: Salva Kiir Mayardit 
				• Population: 7.5-9.7 million (UN estimate, 2006) 
• Area: 619,745 Sq Km 
				• More than a million internally displaced people and nearly 400,000 effectively forced to leave the country. 
• 4.9 million people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. 
				• 3.7 million at high risk of food insecurity in the coming year.  
Women and girls have been raped or abducted and several of South Sudan’s largest towns are now deserted after homes and other civilian property have been destroyed. 
There have also been attacks on medical facilities and places where civilians have sought protection, including churches and hospitals. Humanitarian agencies trying to reach those affected by the violence have faced intimidation and have had their equipment and supplies destroyed or looted. 
Civilians from South Sudan’s two largest communities, the Dinka and the Nuer, as well as other groups like the Shilluk, have also been the targets of violence due to their ethnic identity and assumed political affiliations. Members of government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, as well as army defectors and allied militias loyal to ex-Vice-President Dr Riek Machar have systematically targeted civilians based on ethnicity, resulting in a cycle of revenge killings. 
More than one million people have been forced to leave their homes, becoming internally displaced within South Sudan, while nearly 400,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.	  
I was in Juba, South Sudan, in the two weeks leading up to Independence Day. We spoke with internally displaced persons (IDPs) who are sheltered within the two United Nations (UN) bases in Juba, many of whom fled to these bases in December after the conflict erupted. We also met with IDPs who have come to Juba from other parts of the country and are living in informal settlements. 
Overwhelmingly, I was struck by the sadness of South Sudanese people as the country was preparing to mark three years of independence. People I met said they had little pride in their country. Hopes and dreams have been dashed by the current conflict. Many of those living on UN bases feel trapped, too afraid to circulate freely on the streets of the capital. 
In meetings with government officials, we urged them to increase efforts to investigate abuses and bring those responsible to justice. Accountability is critical to improving public confidence in members of the security sector and as a deterrent to future abuses. We also called for members of the public to be able to engage in public debate about the country’s future without fear of reprisals.	  
Prior to the conflict the situation was mixed. 
On the positive side, South Sudan gave some early indications that it would abolish the death penalty. In December 2012, it voted in favour of a moratorium on capital punishment at the UN General Assembly. Prior to the conflict there were around 200 people sentenced to death in South Sudan; abolition would be a positive step. 
Nevertheless, South Sudan has suffered from pervasive human rights concerns since independence, including the harassment of human rights activists and journalists, unlawful killings of civilians by the South Sudan Armed Forces (SPLA) and arbitrary detentions. 
Since December 2013, the situation has gotten much worse. In addition to the widespread attacks on civilians, the UN has said that 4.9 million people across the country are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Some 3.7 million people are at high risk of food insecurity in the coming year due to fighting preventing farmers from working during planting season. South Sudan now faces the worst risk of famine in Africa since the mid-1980s.	  
The conflict began as a political dispute within South Sudan’s ruling party, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) between President Kiir, and Dr Machar. 
In early 2013, Machar, then Vice-President, openly declared his desire to challenge Kiir for the chairmanship of the SPLM and then run for the presidency in the 2015 general elections. That April, Kiir withdrew executive powers delegated to Machar and suspended the National Reconciliation Conference, an initiative chaired by Machar. Kiir also retired senior generals, replaced two state governors and, in July 2013, dismissed almost his entire cabinet, including Machar. 
Machar, joined by senior members of the SPLM, denounced these decisions, accusing Kiir of corruption, paralyzing the SPLM party, forming a personal army and of unilateral decision-making influenced by “regional and ethnic lobbies”. 
The splits in the SPLM leadership were evident at an internal meeting of its Political Bureau on 14 December 2013, the day before conflict broke out. At the meeting, Machar accused Kiir of offering no room for political dialogue and declared he and others would boycott a session scheduled for the following day. 
After the session on 15 December, fighting broke out between soldiers of the Presidential Guard, quickly escalating into an armed confrontation in Juba between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar.Security forces split largely along ethnic lines, with many Dinka maintaining allegiance to the government, and many Nuer defecting to join the opposition, referred to as the SPLM/A in Opposition. 
Both parties appeared to use ethnicity as an indicator of political allegiance, but as the conflict spread, and reprisal killings continued, ethnicity seemed to supersede politics as the primary motivation for killing. This has resulted in a cycle of revenge killings and has created deep rifts between communities.	  
Every side of the conflict bears some degree of responsibility. 
Amnesty International and other human rights organizations, as well as the Human Rights Division of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) have documented crimes committed by both government and opposition forces. 
During the conflict, several large towns, such as Bor, Bentiu and Malakal, have alternated between control by government and non-government forces. Human rights monitors have found evidence that while under anti-government control, Dinka civilians were killed and fled in large numbers, while the same was true of Nuer civilians when government control was restored.	  
Although South Sudan’s independence was widely celebrated, the new country already faced a range of problems. The armed forces were far from being an organized, trained, professional army, and were fractured by soldiers’ allegiances to former militia leaders. 
South Sudan also had a weak justice system that failed to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations and abuses. Since South Sudan gained regional autonomy from Sudan in 2005, there have been clashes between the military and militia groups, and violence between various communities, resulting in large-scale displacement and thousands of civilian deaths. However, such violations and abuses have not been adequately investigated, and perpetrators have not been held to account. This leads individuals and groups affected to believe that the only way to ensure those responsible are punished and prevent future abuses is by taking the law into their own hands and engaging in reprisal attacks. 
The current conflict in part stems from such problems and now shows little sign of abating. A number of agreements were made over the past few months. A cessation of hostilities agreement was signed on 23 January 2014 by representatives of the government and the opposition forces, which was renewed on 5 May, and followed by a 9 May agreement by Kiir and Machar “to resolve the conflict.” However, not only were these agreements ignored by both sides, but they also did not deter forces on either side from carrying out targeted violence against civilians. 
The immediate priority is for both sides in the conflict to stop attacks on civilians. 
Leaders on both sides must ensure that combatants responsible for violations and abuses are removed from the ranks and held accountable. Humanitarian agencies must be given unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan to help those in need. 
Also, authorities in South Sudan must conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations into reports of unlawful killings, torture, and other ill-treatment and survivors must be provided with adequate reparations. 
In addition, the international community should support the Commission of Inquiry, set up by the African Union earlier this year to investigate human rights violations and abuses committed during the conflict.

, 	On 9 July, South Sudan will mark three years as an independent state. But the growing pains of the world’s newest country are evident as millions are trapped in a vicious cycle of violence. Amnesty International’s Elizabeth Ashamu Deng looks at some of the problems facing South Sudan today. 
, 	  
,  
,  
The situation is catastrophic. Both government and opposition forces engaged in the fighting have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave human rights violations and abuses. 
,  
Thousands of people, many of them civilians, have died over the past six months. 
,  
,  
South Sudan: Facts at a Glance 
,  
				• Became an independent state on 9 July 2011 
,  
• President: Salva Kiir Mayardit 
,  
				• Population: 7.5-9.7 million (UN estimate, 2006) 
,  
• Area: 619,745 Sq Km 
,  
				• More than a million internally displaced people and nearly 400,000 effectively forced to leave the country. 
,  
• 4.9 million people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. 
,  
				• 3.7 million at high risk of food insecurity in the coming year.  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
Women and girls have been raped or abducted and several of South Sudan’s largest towns are now deserted after homes and other civilian property have been destroyed. 
,  
There have also been attacks on medical facilities and places where civilians have sought protection, including churches and hospitals. Humanitarian agencies trying to reach those affected by the violence have faced intimidation and have had their equipment and supplies destroyed or looted. 
,  
Civilians from South Sudan’s two largest communities, the Dinka and the Nuer, as well as other groups like the Shilluk, have also been the targets of violence due to their ethnic identity and assumed political affiliations. Members of government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, as well as army defectors and allied militias loyal to ex-Vice-President Dr Riek Machar have systematically targeted civilians based on ethnicity, resulting in a cycle of revenge killings. 
,  
More than one million people have been forced to leave their homes, becoming internally displaced within South Sudan, while nearly 400,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. 
, 	  
,  
,  
I was in Juba, South Sudan, in the two weeks leading up to Independence Day. We spoke with internally displaced persons (IDPs) who are sheltered within the two United Nations (UN) bases in Juba, many of whom fled to these bases in December after the conflict erupted. We also met with IDPs who have come to Juba from other parts of the country and are living in informal settlements. 
,  
Overwhelmingly, I was struck by the sadness of South Sudanese people as the country was preparing to mark three years of independence. People I met said they had little pride in their country. Hopes and dreams have been dashed by the current conflict. Many of those living on UN bases feel trapped, too afraid to circulate freely on the streets of the capital. 
,  
In meetings with government officials, we urged them to increase efforts to investigate abuses and bring those responsible to justice. Accountability is critical to improving public confidence in members of the security sector and as a deterrent to future abuses. We also called for members of the public to be able to engage in public debate about the country’s future without fear of reprisals. 
, 	  
,  
,  
Prior to the conflict the situation was mixed. 
,  
On the positive side, South Sudan gave some early indications that it would abolish the death penalty. In December 2012, it voted in favour of a moratorium on capital punishment at the UN General Assembly. Prior to the conflict there were around 200 people sentenced to death in South Sudan; abolition would be a positive step. 
,  
Nevertheless, South Sudan has suffered from pervasive human rights concerns since independence, including the harassment of human rights activists and journalists, unlawful killings of civilians by the South Sudan Armed Forces (SPLA) and arbitrary detentions. 
,  
Since December 2013, the situation has gotten much worse. In addition to the widespread attacks on civilians, the UN has said that 4.9 million people across the country are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Some 3.7 million people are at high risk of food insecurity in the coming year due to fighting preventing farmers from working during planting season. South Sudan now faces the worst risk of famine in Africa since the mid-1980s. 
, 	  
,  
,  
The conflict began as a political dispute within South Sudan’s ruling party, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) between President Kiir, and Dr Machar. 
,  
In early 2013, Machar, then Vice-President, openly declared his desire to challenge Kiir for the chairmanship of the SPLM and then run for the presidency in the 2015 general elections. That April, Kiir withdrew executive powers delegated to Machar and suspended the National Reconciliation Conference, an initiative chaired by Machar. Kiir also retired senior generals, replaced two state governors and, in July 2013, dismissed almost his entire cabinet, including Machar. 
,  
Machar, joined by senior members of the SPLM, denounced these decisions, accusing Kiir of corruption, paralyzing the SPLM party, forming a personal army and of unilateral decision-making influenced by “regional and ethnic lobbies”. 
,  
The splits in the SPLM leadership were evident at an internal meeting of its Political Bureau on 14 December 2013, the day before conflict broke out. At the meeting, Machar accused Kiir of offering no room for political dialogue and declared he and others would boycott a session scheduled for the following day. 
,  
After the session on 15 December, fighting broke out between soldiers of the Presidential Guard, quickly escalating into an armed confrontation in Juba between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar.Security forces split largely along ethnic lines, with many Dinka maintaining allegiance to the government, and many Nuer defecting to join the opposition, referred to as the SPLM/A in Opposition. 
,  
Both parties appeared to use ethnicity as an indicator of political allegiance, but as the conflict spread, and reprisal killings continued, ethnicity seemed to supersede politics as the primary motivation for killing. This has resulted in a cycle of revenge killings and has created deep rifts between communities. 
, 	  
,  
,  
Every side of the conflict bears some degree of responsibility. 
,  
Amnesty International and other human rights organizations, as well as the Human Rights Division of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) have documented crimes committed by both government and opposition forces. 
,  
During the conflict, several large towns, such as Bor, Bentiu and Malakal, have alternated between control by government and non-government forces. Human rights monitors have found evidence that while under anti-government control, Dinka civilians were killed and fled in large numbers, while the same was true of Nuer civilians when government control was restored. 
, 	  
,  
,  
Although South Sudan’s independence was widely celebrated, the new country already faced a range of problems. The armed forces were far from being an organized, trained, professional army, and were fractured by soldiers’ allegiances to former militia leaders. 
,  
South Sudan also had a weak justice system that failed to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations and abuses. Since South Sudan gained regional autonomy from Sudan in 2005, there have been clashes between the military and militia groups, and violence between various communities, resulting in large-scale displacement and thousands of civilian deaths. However, such violations and abuses have not been adequately investigated, and perpetrators have not been held to account. This leads individuals and groups affected to believe that the only way to ensure those responsible are punished and prevent future abuses is by taking the law into their own hands and engaging in reprisal attacks. 
,  
The current conflict in part stems from such problems and now shows little sign of abating. A number of agreements were made over the past few months. A cessation of hostilities agreement was signed on 23 January 2014 by representatives of the government and the opposition forces, which was renewed on 5 May, and followed by a 9 May agreement by Kiir and Machar “to resolve the conflict.” However, not only were these agreements ignored by both sides, but they also did not deter forces on either side from carrying out targeted violence against civilians. 
,  
,  
The immediate priority is for both sides in the conflict to stop attacks on civilians. 
,  
Leaders on both sides must ensure that combatants responsible for violations and abuses are removed from the ranks and held accountable. Humanitarian agencies must be given unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan to help those in need. 
,  
Also, authorities in South Sudan must conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations into reports of unlawful killings, torture, and other ill-treatment and survivors must be provided with adequate reparations. 
,  
In addition, the international community should support the Commission of Inquiry, set up by the African Union earlier this year to investigate human rights violations and abuses committed during the conflict. 
,  
Justice is essential for human rights to become a reality in South Sudan. There must be no amnesties or political deals that would allow those found guilty of abuses to escape justice.

For anyone following the news from Pakistan, the past few weeks have made for grim reading when it comes to violence against women. 
Recently, a 21-year old woman in Punjab was found raped and strangled to death by the man she had trusted to save her from an “honor” killing by her family. 
In early June, Saba Maqsood miraculously survived being shot by her relatives and dumped into a canal in Hafizabad town in Pakistan’s Punjab province for trying to marry the man of her choosing against family wishes. 
A week earlier in Lahore, Farzana Iqbal was brutally beaten to death with bricks by up to two dozen relatives, including her father, for marrying the man she loved. Sadly, hundreds of women and girls are subject to “honor” killings in Pakistan every year. 
For many communities in Pakistan, women and girls are seen to embody family honor. A woman’s identity and her family’s sense of social respect and worth is measured by her acquiescence to family demands, such as marrying the man they choose for her. 
What made Iqbal’s death unique was the fact that the perpetrators chose to kill her so brazenly, outside one of the most respected state institutions: the Lahore High Court, in the second largest city in Pakistan and arguably its cultural capital. By all accounts, instead of protecting Iqbal and saving her life, the police stood by and watched the crime unfold. 
 
Most cases like this, however, receive scant attention by the public and the police, as they often happen in small villages or behind closed doors. In February, for example, Ayat Bibi was bludgeoned to death in a north Balochistan village on the orders of a local cleric after being accused by a male relative of having relations with a man named Daraz Khan, who was also killed. Ayat and Daraz’s final resting places are both unmarked graves. Those responsible for the killings have not been brought to justice. 
Farzana Iqbal’s killing, and the publicity that followed, shamed Pakistan’s prime minister and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court into demanding investigations into the incident. Most of the key culprits were soon in jail, and the murder trial is expected to begin shortly. Some politicians and religious leaders have condemned the killing, a welcome move in a country where all too often violence against women is ignored or even justified based on religious or cultural values. 
But what would have been the response if this crime had not been perpetrated in such a public and symbolic space and drawn global attention? As the spotlight fades away from this case, and Iqbal’s battered body settles in the ground like hundreds of others, are the authorities likely to lose interest in ensuring her killers are brought to justice and that the police are held to account for their failure to protect her? 
Seeking justice is extremely problematic in Pakistan, as a wide legal loophole currently exists that allows perpetrators of “honor” killings to escape any punishment. Under Pakistani law in cases of murder, the victim’s family is allowed to pardon the perpetrators. The culprits are then free from prosecution and sentencing. 
So-called honor killings are ubiquitous in several parts of South Asia and other corners of the world. It is difficult to determine exactly how many women fall victim to killings justified as the defense of family “honor,” but the number runs into the thousands worldwide. 
Often, the most severe punishments for transgressions of “honor” or for bringing “shame” on a family are decreed by councils of tribal elders – in which women have no place. In Pakistan, the statistics vary from around 900 to just over 1,000 each year. But these figures represent only instances documented by human rights groups based on reports from the media or law enforcement authorities. 
Addressing these issues, whether in Pakistan, or anywhere else in the world, is challenging because the causes are complex. But like so many other social problems, positive change must start at home. Too often, the home is where the use of violence becomes normalized. It is where the citizen gets conditioned to believe that violence is an acceptable, particularly to excuse violence that is carried out to protect perceived social standing, national honor, or religious sentiments. 
Honor crimes fester in the dark privacy of the home. It is time to expose these abuses to the light of public scrutiny and the law. A number of states have outlawed honor killings and other forms of gender-based violence. But those laws require effective implementation, police and other law enforcement professionals must be trained on gender-based violence. And victims must be confident in the ability of the police and other authorities to assist them. 
The education system is also a key battleground, because it is one of the rare public spaces where young minds can be empowered to challenge gender stereotypes and made aware that violence in the home is unacceptable. Public figures, and especially men, must openly speak out: not only to condemn honor killings, but to acknowledge that these abuses are not random or sporadic incidents but a much wider problem. 
Empirical research in this area is limited, but there is ample anecdotal evidence that public exposure is the most effective way to address the issue, because it forces society to confront the reality that there is no honor in killing women and girls for choosing to live life on their own terms.

Greeting to Amnesty International supporters, from Juba, South Sudan. 
	As our human rights mission gets underway, I thought I’d share an uplifting “Amnesty moment” amidst two long, hot days of interviews in IDP (Internally Displaced People) camps here in Juba; with more to come.  
	These IDP camps are actually within United Nations peacekeeping bases.  The two in Juba hold around 30,000 people.  Nationwide, UN soldiers are sheltering about 100,000 people.  It was an unprecedented decision back in December when people were fleeing widespread massacres. Whereas UN bases have usually been a no-go zone for people fleeing atrocities, this time the UN Mission here made an unparalleled decision to open the gates.  It saved thousands of lives at the time, no doubt. 
 
	But now it is a full blown human rights and humanitarian crisis.  The sites are surrounded by hostile communities; so the UN keeps them firmly locked up.   That, and the fact that people are terrified to go outside, means that they have become virtual prison camps.  Many of the sites have also become death traps as cholera and other diseases have taken hold.  
I spent time yesterday afternoon with a 57 year old man who has seen it all.  Yet, he is everything you imagine in the quintessential African elder.  Every phrase was full of majesty and wisdom.  
He spent many long years fighting for South Sudanese independence and has excruciating pain from a dramatic landmine injury more than 20 years ago.  With a sense of both fatalism and grief he noted that his father had fought for independence from the British; he had fought for independence from the Sudanese; and now his sons were fighting just to stay alive. 
When we started our interview and I had completed my usual introduction of who we were and why we were there, he had a lovely line back to me.  Not word for word, but close: 
“I know Amnesty International very well.  When everyone else has forgotten; Amnesty International is always there.  You have always been there for us. And now here you are today.”  
I sputtered a bit to find the right words after that; as you might imagine. 
I asked if I could take a photo as we wrapped up.  His leg and right side had been paining him considerably during our interview and he had been slouched across two chairs.  His shirt had been unbuttoned to the navel.  He beamed when I asked about the photo.  But no matter how much I protested that he need not move an inch for the picture he insisted that he had to look his very best for Amnesty.  I share that moment with you.

Thousands of Iraqi civilians displaced by the current conflict are stranded at checkpoints separating the areas controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the rest of Iraq. At first civilians, who fled after the Islamic State (formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant – ISIL) captured large areas of northwestern Iraq, were being allowed to enter Iraqi Kurdistan, but in recent weeks and days, access has been severely restricted by the KRG. 
 
Some of those who fled are seeking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan while others want to travel southwards to the capital and beyond. The former are mostly Sunni Muslims who fear air strikes by government forces and their allies and the harsh rule of the Islamic State.The latter are Shia Muslims from the Turkmen and Shabak communities who are trying to flee southwards to government-controlled areas of Iraq where the majority of the population is Shia and where they feel there is no risk of an Islamic State takeover. 
The sudden capture of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, on June 10 by the Islamic State prompted a mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of frightened residents who have poured into the neighbouring autonomous Kurdish region, administered by the KRG.	With the withdrawal of the Iraqi army from northwestern Iraq, the KRG has gained control of the disputed oil-rich town of Kirkuk and other areas, and in recent days, it has announced plans for a referendum on independence, a move fiercely opposed by the Iraqi central government. 
Regardless of the political wrangling between Baghdad and Erbil, it is imperative that civilians displaced by the conflict are granted refuge in and safe passage through KRG-controlled areas. 
While Iraqi and international political discourse seems largely out of step with the rapidly changing reality on the ground, the sectarian dimension of the conflict is becoming more marked by the day and Iraq’s diverse communities are struggling to grapple with the new reality. They increasingly wonder where and how they can be safe. 
The Turkmen community is a telling example. When I first arrived in Iraq, just after the capture by the Islamic State of Tal Afar – home to some 200,000 people – and other areas mostly inhabited by members of the Turkmen community, local residents mostly identified themselves as Turkmen. Now, only a few weeks later, virtually all those I meet identify themselves as Turkmen Shia or Turkmen Sunni. 
The Turkmen Shia are trying to flee to the Shia stronghold in the south, the Turkmen Sunni are not even contemplating going there; they are staying put in the north, terrified of government air strikes against areas controlled by the Islamic State. 
“We are not with ISIL, but when the government bombs ISIL we are in the middle and when we get killed nobody cares,” said a woman whose relatives – two young children and their parents – were killed in an air strike in Tal Afar on June 22. 
Shia Shabak who have fled villages east of Mosul recently seized by the Islamic State, told me that some of their relatives had been killed or captured, while their Shabak Sunni neighbours had remained in the villages and faced no trouble from the Islamic State. 
Many Shia Turkmen and Shabak civilians I met have alleged that their Sunni neighbours are cooperating with the Islamic State, while Sunni Turkmen and Shabak have accused Shia members of their community of being linked to pro-government armed Shia militias. 
While no evidence is generally provided to support such polarising narratives, perception can be as important as reality, poisoning relations between communities and adding fuel to an already inflamed situation. 
Minorities in Iraq, including Christians, Yazidis and others feel particularly vulnerable, and rightly so. The Islamic State referred to their Yazidi hostages as “devil worshippers” in one of their recent videos, and the abduction of two Christian nuns in Mosul on June 28 are just two examples of a string of recent incidents targeting minority groups. 
However, members of Iraq’s majority communities do not feel safe either. Indeed, most of those killed and displaced in this conflict are from the Shia- and Sunni-majority communities, who happened to be a minority in a particular place at a particular time. 
Increasing speculation about a possible three-way split of Iraq into Shia, Sunni and Kurdish states or entities, is raising serious concerns about the massive population displacement which would likely ensue. Minorities are very concerned about whether, if this came to fruition, their communities would still have a future in Iraq. Iraqi leaders and would-be leaders and their backers in the international community must act responsibly and work towards finding solutions to the current crisis which ensure that members of all communities are protected and their rights respected.

Many Shia Turkmen and Shabak civilians I met have alleged that their Sunni neighbours are cooperating with the Islamic State, while Sunni Turkmen and Shabak have accused Shia members of their community of being linked to pro-government armed Shia militias. 
,  
While no evidence is generally provided to support such polarising narratives, perception can be as important as reality, poisoning relations between communities and adding fuel to an already inflamed situation. 
,  
Minorities in Iraq, including Christians, Yazidis and others feel particularly vulnerable, and rightly so. The Islamic State referred to their Yazidi hostages as “devil worshippers” in one of their recent videos, and the abduction of two Christian nuns in Mosul on June 28 are just two examples of a string of recent incidents targeting minority groups. 
,  
However, members of Iraq’s majority communities do not feel safe either. Indeed, most of those killed and displaced in this conflict are from the Shia- and Sunni-majority communities, who happened to be a minority in a particular place at a particular time. 
,  
Increasing speculation about a possible three-way split of Iraq into Shia, Sunni and Kurdish states or entities, is raising serious concerns about the massive population displacement which would likely ensue. Minorities are very concerned about whether, if this came to fruition, their communities would still have a future in Iraq. Iraqi leaders and would-be leaders and their backers in the international community must act responsibly and work towards finding solutions to the current crisis which ensure that members of all communities are protected and their rights respected.

“Stop publishing articles on federalism” 
	That is the warning media outlets in South Sudan received in late June, through phone calls and visits from government security officers.  
The National Security Service had decided that it was a threat to “national security” to discuss federalism – an approach to governance embraced by states around the world and already a feature of the interim South Sudanese Constitution. There was no written decree to back up their ominous warning.  
 
The Juba Monitor’s unswerving Editor-in-Chief, Alfred Taban, was outraged. So he decried the move in a forceful editorial on 1 July. He announced that his paper would not comply with a demand that he considered to be unconstitutional, an assault on freedom of expression and, ultimately, an impediment to national security itself. 
And national security responded. The next day all copies of the popular daily newspaper were seized in the early hours of the morning, keeping it out of readers’ hands. It wasn’t the first time that has happened to Alfred Taban and the Juba Monitor. 
The Juba Monitor is not the only media outlet under siege. On 7 July national security seized all copies of The Citizen. On 3 July, the paper had printed a letter written by the country’s Minister of Information, condemning any censorship of articles about federalism. Then, on 5 July, a front page article covered a strong statement from the South Sudan Human Rights Commission similarly rejecting “federalism censorship”. As unbelievable as it sounds, The Citizen was punished for reporting on comments made by a Minister and the country’s national human rights body. 
Articles, opinion pieces, radio interviews and television coverage looking at federalism are part of a wider, very necessary debate that is so essential in South Sudan, the world’s youngest state that will mark its third anniversary of independence on 9 July. At a time such as this, the country urgently needs a national conversation about lasting solutions to the political crisis and internal armed conflict in recent months that have led to a massive human rights and humanitarian catastrophe. 
The government should encourage and welcome the debate; not penalize and shut it down.	  
The fiat about federalism only adds to a growing list of recent measures that send a clear message that freedom of expression is under attack in South Sudan. The National Security Service similarly cited security concerns when journalists were earlier warned not to quote individuals involved with the armed opposition. Reporters, editors, publishers and broadcasters face increasing intimidation, threats and harassment. Some have been assaulted, arrested or expelled from the country. Media houses have been robbed or had equipment confiscated. And there is mounting censorship, including the seizure of newspapers. 
We were shown reports documenting 70 serious incidents against journalists in the country, particularly in Juba, over the past nine months alone. The pattern is clear. The crackdown is intensifying.	  
Before independence in July 2011, Alfred Taban endured long years of media repression in Sudan when he worked as a journalist in Khartoum. But he describes what is happening now in South Sudan as more troubling. As he told us, “in Khartoum we expected that [the Sudanese authorities] would view us as enemies; here we are supposed to be among brothers.” 
Against this backdrop, a long overdue initiative to adopt media legislation in South Sudan has stalled. The legislative package is not perfect, but is a step in the right direction. It was adopted by Parliament in July 2013, it was sent to President Salva Kiir for approval. One year later no one seems to know when, or even if, the President will sign it into law. 
The National Security Service has played an active role monitoring and regulating the media, particularly since the conflict broke out on 15 December, purportedly to protect national security. It has summoned journalists and members of civil society, issued oral directives, and ordered at least one publication to shut down. There is no legal foundation for such acts—there is in fact no law governing the National Security Service. 
The combination of a legislative vacuum and a media crackdown is deeply troubling. Many people here have suggested that the two are connected.	  
And then there is the wider human rights context. 
South Sudan is still reeling from the massive human rights violations and staggering humanitarian catastrophe unleashed when clashes erupted within the country’s military, the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, on the night of 15 December 2013. Fighting quickly spilled out from the barracks, and civilians – first in Juba and then throughout the country – were targeted. 
The ensuing violence between forces loyal to President Kiir and those who have taken up arms for his former Vice President Riek Machar, has been marked by widespread and shockingly brutal war crimes and crimes against humanity in many parts of the country. Both sides are guilty. Our report issued in May, Nowhere safe: Civilians under attack in South Sudan, made that very clear. 
There are no reliable estimates of the numbers who have been killed. In January the International Crisis Group reported that it is at least 10,000. That was six months ago. 
Almost 1.5 million people have fled from their homes. Some 400,000 have escaped to neighbouring countries as refugees; 1.1 million remain internally displaced (IDPs). Of those, 100,000 particularly vulnerable IDPs have been given shelter inside UN peacekeeping bases, an unprecedented move by the UN. But with widespread insecurity and hostility around them, many of those sites have become virtual detention camps, locked up to keep danger out; leaving women, men and children imprisoned inside. 
Meanwhile a ‘cessation of hostilities’ agreement between the two forces is regularly breached and rumours swirl that both sides are rearming, recruiting and readying for another round of fighting.	  
There has been no accountability for these terrible crimes. A presidential committee has been set up to investigate, but very few people know what they are investigating and how they are doing it. That does nothing to instill confidence that the crisis is soon to end. A leader in one of the IDP sites at the UN bases put it bluntly to us: “there is no such thing as justice here.” 
Internationally, the African Union (AU) has initiated a Commission of Inquiry to “investigate the human rights violations and other abuses committed during the armed conflict in South Sudan”. That Commission presented an Interim Report to the AU in late June. 
All of this as the country readies to mark the 3rd anniversary of independence on 9 July. Now is the time for a full commitment to protecting human rights in South Sudan. 
One easy step forward would be to stop the media crackdown. Respecting freedom of expression is not a threat to national security in South Sudan. Quite the contrary; it is at the very heart of protecting human rights, restoring security and bringing the country’s devastating crisis to an end.

This strategic port city just across a thin stretch of water from Crimea has “changed hands” twice in the last two months. 
We travelled there to try to document allegations of human rights violations and abuses amid the turbulent background in eastern Ukraine. The sun is shining, the banks and shops are open, and there are people going about their business – but not many. This is the season for holiday-makers. But there are none. At times it is eerily quiet; the first telling sign that all is not well. 
The people of Mariupol are still coming to terms with recent history. 
Back in May, key administrative buildings in the city were occupied by anti-Kyiv protesters. The police simply vacated their headquarters, in front of a cheering crowd, and left the city at the mercy of the self-styled Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR), the pro-Russian paramilitaries. The military personnel stationed at a nearby base also withdrew. 
It was only on 13 June that pro-Kyiv armed units entered the city, driving out the separatists, with eight reportedly killed and around 30 arrested. 
But Mariupol is relatively lucky. There has been trouble, but significantly less than in many other towns and cities across the region. And things have seemingly calmed down. So much so that it is now increasingly a destination for people escaping the escalating conflict further north. We were told there were only two internally displaced families there two weeks ago. There are now 52 here and many more in satellite towns. 
With the announcement of a ceasefire on 23 June we were expecting to hear that the situation was improving. But while the violence may have stopped here for now, there is an overriding atmosphere of tension, suspicion and deeply engrained fear. 
We met with Victoria, an accountant by trade, in a café on the edge of the city centre. She comes with company: two men, her bodyguards. They sit awkwardly at tables adjacent to ours watching the doors as we drink our coffees and talk to a background of piped jazz music, with black and white photographs of Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot and other A-list Hollywood stars lining the walls. The café is otherwise empty. 
Given the seeming calm, it appears odd that Victoria, whose pro-Ukrainian position is well known, should need bodyguards. But there is good reason for her caution. While many of the armed supporters loyal to the DNR have now gone into hiding, they are far from a spent force: she regularly finds bullets dropped as a warning in her post box. But more importantly, she believes that Mariupol may only nominally be under the control of Kyiv. The loyalty of the police and other authorities is under question, and this is to say nothing of those who believe that Ukraine is now run by a “junta” from Kyiv. 
In the absence of state protection, Victoria now runs a network of volunteers, a local self-defence group. She believes that they keep the separatists, or “terrorists” as she calls them, from resurfacing. The group came into being in April after clashes between protesters left nine pro-Ukrainian activists in intensive care. Victoria believes it is only through the efforts of her organization, whose members respond promptly to incidents of violence, that the fragile order in the city is preserved. 
Just how fragile the order in Mariupol is, and the allegiance of local officials, is hard to say. But the police are rarely seen in the city. People are reluctant to talk – even some of those who’d agreed to meet us. A journalist who had reportedly been targeted and abducted by the DNR during the elections suddenly stopped returning our calls. 
We met some recently arrived internally displaced people in Mariupol: destitute, fearful for their future and confused, they left their possessions and their lives back in Slavyansk where some of the worst military fighting has occurred. When we greeted a middle-aged man in a flat hat, his first response was: “I won’t be telling you anything!” 
What will happen to Mariupol amid the chaos of conflict and lawlessness in eastern Ukraine is difficult to predict. But there are some very worrying trends. 
According to the UN monitors we met, there has been surge of abductions and allegations of torture. 
In Mariupol, after pro-Kyiv forces “liberated” buildings held by the pro-Russians, we were told that some 50 people were found in a cellar – abducted, intimidated and tortured. This figure we could not verify, but we had heard of such cases before coming to Mariupol, and have documented others from Donetsk, Luhansk and other places now under control of anti-Kyiv armed groups. The anti-Kyiv side has also alleged that their activists were being abducted, and this we would like to ascertain. 
Credible sources close to the heart of Mariupol’s administration expressed grave concerns over the number of different armed factions in the city, be they pro-Russian, pro-Ukrainian or even opportunistic criminals. There are no clear, or extremely confused, command structures in many of the armed groups across the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The same appears true of many of the “battalions” made up of volunteers who engage in battles in the east on the pro-Kyiv side. 
So who is in control in Mariupol? At the moment the Ukrainian flag is flying high over administrative buildings. But the tables could turn as quickly as a flick of a switch. For the people of Mariupol this leaves an uncertain future steeped in suspicion, mistrust and a very real fear for what’s to come.

The mass exodus is testament to the impact on civilians since fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) took control of the city. 
As we headed east towards Erbil militants from ISIS were indiscriminately shelling Hamdanyah, home to some of Iraq’s religious and ethnic minorities. 
The ISIS offensive on the eastern front of Iraq’s second city was yet more evidence of how all sides are committing war crimes in the raging battle for control of Iraqi territory and resources. Whether deliberately targeted or caught in the crossfire of often reckless fighting, civilians are bearing the brunt as ISIS and other Sunni armed groups and the Iraqi armed forces and Shi’a militias battle each other. 
At nightfall in the nearby town of Kalak, east of Mosul, I met several Christian families who had just arrived from Qaraqosh. A father of four young children told me: 
“We heard loud bangs, people said it was mortar strikes, I don’t know how near they were. We just got in the car – my wife, the children, my parents and my wife’s aunt – and left without taking anything. I don’t know where we’ll spend the night, but at least we’ll be safe. Tomorrow we’ll see if it’s safe to go back home; what else can we do?” 
But as clashes between ISIS militants and Peshmerga forces raged on Hamdanya residents fled en masse. Yesterday (26 June) I found the area completely empty, except for two families who were waiting to leave, an old man who told me he would die in his home, two doctors and two priests. Surrounding towns and villages were overflowing with displaced families. 
In Mosul I visited the families of five young men who were killed on 7 June when an artillery shell struck the roof terrace where they were sitting drinking tea and chatting. Pointing to the large recently repaired hole left by the shell, which exploded on the roof terrace and went straight through to the room below, the father of Seif, one of those killed, told me: 
“We repaired this, but nothing will repair my broken heart. My boy was taken from me and my other son was so badly injured he will never recover. I thank God that my other children are safe; we were in the room next to the one where the shell came through; we could have all been killed if we had been in the next room.” 
Seif’s younger siblings and other neighbours told me that the strike which hit the house was the first of a series of seven or eight strikes they heard. The rest landed nearby, thankfully without causing further casualties. 
Seif’s older brother, the only survivor from the group who was sitting on the roof terrace when the shell struck, is bedridden and clearly in a lot of pain. Large pieces of shrapnel ripped through his chest, abdomen and groin, causing serious damage to internal organs. 
He spoke with difficulty, grimacing and groaning in pain at the slightest movement: 
“Nobody was going out because of the situation (ISIS militants had entered the city from the western outskirts in the previous two days and the army and security forces has withdrawn across the river in the east of the city) so we were sitting in our home, with family and neighbours. My parents, the women and children were downstairs and we, the young men, me and my brother and our neighbours, were sitting on the terrace. We did not hear any strikes before the one that hit us; we would not have stayed on the terrace otherwise. I just remember seeing a flash of light and a lot of pain.” 
A civil servant who was with the Iraqi army as they withdrew from the city told me that at that time the army was shelling the west of the city from the barracks of the second brigade (al-firqa al-thaniya) in al-Kind area in the east of the city. Artillery is too imprecise and should never be used in residential areas full of civilians. Repeatedly using such weapons in this manner, without due regard for the harm being caused to civilians, violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime. 
Other civilians have been killed in similar strikes more recently in and around Tal ‘Afar, north-west of Mosul. On 22 June as I was interviewing a family who fled Tal ‘Afar and is now sheltering near Erbil, they received a call from their relatives in Tal ‘Afar, telling them that their cousin, Adnan, his wife Zeinab and their two young children, a boy and a girl aged six and eight, had just been killed in an artillery strike by the Iraqi forces on their home. They too had fled Tal ‘Afar when it had been taken over by ISIS earlier this month, but had returned back home two days earlier, thinking that it was now safe and to escape grim conditions in the place where they were sheltering. 
Nine other civilians were killed and several injured in another strike by the Iraqi forces in Aayadiya, where they had sought safety after fleeing their homes in Tal ‘Afar; among the victims were children, women and elderly people. There are many more such cases which do not get reported because as civilians flee from place to place even relatives lose touch with one another. 
In Mosul I passed by groups of men outside mosques where former policemen, civil defence members and others go to publicly “repent” (Towba) for their association with the government that now no longer controls the city. They are doing so in response to ISIS announcement that those who “repent” will not be harmed. 
However, there is no guarantee that ISIS will keep its word. Rather, its brutal track record raises fears that they may do just the opposite – if not now, later. Those who “repent” have to hand over their ID cards and personal details (address, telephone numbers, etc.), which will make it easier for ISIS to find them if they decide to go after them. 
But, as in most conflicts, abuses are not only being committed by one party. ISIS has publicized and even boasted about some of its atrocities, while the Iraqi government, busy trying to secure international support, has been keen to hide those committed by its forces. 
I also talked to families and witnesses about detainees killed in detention centres by the armed forces before they left Mosul and Tal ‘Afar. 
As the confrontations continue to escalate, civilians are increasingly at risk of a multitude of violations by all sides.

Long lines of cars full of terrified families jammed the road as I left Mosul on 25 June. The mass exodus is testament to the impact on civilians since fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) took control of the city. 
,  
As we headed east towards Erbil militants from ISIS were indiscriminately shelling Hamdanyah, home to some of Iraq’s religious and ethnic minorities. 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
The ISIS offensive on the eastern front of Iraq’s second city was yet more evidence of how all sides are committing war crimes in the raging battle for control of Iraqi territory and resources. Whether deliberately targeted or caught in the crossfire of often reckless fighting, civilians are bearing the brunt as ISIS and other Sunni armed groups and the Iraqi armed forces and Shi’a militias battle each other. 
,  
At nightfall in the nearby town of Kalak, east of Mosul, I met several Christian families who had just arrived from Qaraqosh. A father of four young children told me: 
,  
“We heard loud bangs, people said it was mortar strikes, I don’t know how near they were. We just got in the car – my wife, the children, my parents and my wife’s aunt – and left without taking anything. I don’t know where we’ll spend the night, but at least we’ll be safe. Tomorrow we’ll see if it’s safe to go back home; what else can we do?” 
,  
But as clashes between ISIS militants and Peshmerga forces raged on Hamdanya residents fled en masse. Yesterday (26 June) I found the area completely empty, except for two families who were waiting to leave, an old man who told me he would die in his home, two doctors and two priests. Surrounding towns and villages were overflowing with displaced families. 
,  
,  
In Mosul I visited the families of five young men who were killed on 7 June when an artillery shell struck the roof terrace where they were sitting drinking tea and chatting. Pointing to the large recently repaired hole left by the shell, which exploded on the roof terrace and went straight through to the room below, the father of Seif, one of those killed, told me: 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
“We repaired this, but nothing will repair my broken heart. My boy was taken from me and my other son was so badly injured he will never recover. I thank God that my other children are safe; we were in the room next to the one where the shell came through; we could have all been killed if we had been in the next room.” 
,  
Seif’s younger siblings and other neighbours told me that the strike which hit the house was the first of a series of seven or eight strikes they heard. The rest landed nearby, thankfully without causing further casualties. 
,  
Seif’s older brother, the only survivor from the group who was sitting on the roof terrace when the shell struck, is bedridden and clearly in a lot of pain. Large pieces of shrapnel ripped through his chest, abdomen and groin, causing serious damage to internal organs. 
,  
He spoke with difficulty, grimacing and groaning in pain at the slightest movement: 
,  
“Nobody was going out because of the situation (ISIS militants had entered the city from the western outskirts in the previous two days and the army and security forces has withdrawn across the river in the east of the city) so we were sitting in our home, with family and neighbours. My parents, the women and children were downstairs and we, the young men, me and my brother and our neighbours, were sitting on the terrace. We did not hear any strikes before the one that hit us; we would not have stayed on the terrace otherwise. I just remember seeing a flash of light and a lot of pain.” 
,  
A civil servant who was with the Iraqi army as they withdrew from the city told me that at that time the army was shelling the west of the city from the barracks of the second brigade (al-firqa al-thaniya) in al-Kind area in the east of the city. Artillery is too imprecise and should never be used in residential areas full of civilians. Repeatedly using such weapons in this manner, without due regard for the harm being caused to civilians, violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime. 
,  
Other civilians have been killed in similar strikes more recently in and around Tal ‘Afar, north-west of Mosul.

,  
Our biggest concerns were sunburn, dehydration, and blistered feet. Why did we march? Because we can. 
,  
 
,  
Because we couldn’t not so long ago in Canadian history. 
,  
 
,  
Because the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) community in many countries continues to march in the face of discrimination, threats, and violence.  
,  
 
,  
And because in many countries it is not possible to march or even be ‘out’ with your sexual orientation or gender identity. 
,  
 
,  
Toronto wrapped itself in rainbows as the host of World Pride, the ‘Expo of Prides,’ which drew activists from around the globe. 
,  
 
,  
  
,  
We participated in the World Pride Human Rights Conference, where we heard from activists working to end discrimination in their home countries—many are activists that Amnesty International works with closely, and some are human rights defenders on whose behalf we regularly work. 
,  
 
,  
We co-hosted a screening of a documentary on homophobia in Jamaica and took action to show our solidarity with Jamaican LGBTI activists. 
,  
 
,  
We joined with partners in the transgender community at the Trans March. And we showed our support for Bill C-279, a bill on gender identity currently waiting to pass in Canada’s Senate. 
,  
 
,  
And we were out in force at the World Pride parade, where we marched to cheers and chants of “Amnesty, Amnesty!” as we marched in solidarity with the brave activists in so many countries who march in situations where sunburn is the least of their worries. 
,  
 
,  
All week long we were humbled by the courage and determination of LGBTI activists from around the world, we were thrilled with the support from our Amnesty International community in Toronto, and we left with hope. Hope that with sustained activism both in Canada and around the world, that a world where our diversity is celebrated is possible.

After being sentenced to 100 lashes and death by hanging, after over four months in prison with her 20-month-old son Martin, and after giving birth to daughter Maya on a floor in shackles, Meriam was released from prison and re-united with her husband Daniel. 
But this happy family re-union turned sour very quickly. Sudanese officials detained Meriam and her family at the airport as they were trying to leave Sudan. Meriam has been charged with attempting to travel with false documents. Meriam, Daniel, and their two children are now living in the US Embassy in Khartoum while these new charges are addressed. Meriam may be out of prison but she is not yet truly free. 
What an unimaginable ordeal this has been for Meriam! What a testimony to her strength that she held firm to her beliefs despite the injustice and mistreatment she experienced. 
Meriam’s story has inspired human rights supporters the world over, and forced heads of governments to stand with her and demand justice. 
Meriam has taken a stand for freedom of religion and freedom of expression, rights we hold dearly. And they are rights that only grow stronger when we defend them. And she has drawn attention to the violations of women’s human rights that take place daily in Sudan. 
The international pressure helped defend these rights. And more importantly, helped spare this incredible woman from the death penalty. 
Of course, Amnesty’s work is not done in this story. We will continue to follow Meriam’s case until she is safely out of harm’s way. And we will advocate for gender equalilty, an end to the death penalty and other human rights abuses that continue to be committed in Sudan.  
We will urge Sudan to:	• end the inhumane practice of flogging as a punishment	• remove apostasy and adultery from the criminal code	• establish a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty, and	• end gender-based violence and discrimination	Tremendous victories like this give us hope for others who still need dedicated people like you and a strong organization like Amnesty International to defend their rights.

,

,  
,  
The Regional Meeting was attended by 115 participants from the Greater Toronto Area and beyond, some of them long-term AI members, some new to AI while others were people who expressed interest in joining the organization and choose the Regional Meeting as their first introduction  into the world of Amnesty.

The panel on torture was an important, powerful and inspiring way to introduce the campaign, to bring Abdullah Almalki and Marina Nemat’s experiences to our membership, to get our volunteers excited and engage them into taking action. 
,  
The “Free Prior and Informed Consent (Colombia, Guatemala, Canada)” workshop had wonderful energy and visuals. As one participant said::  “The facilitators did a great job at getting us up to speed.  It was so moving to ‘hear’ the speakers from Colombia, Guatemala and Canada”. 
,  
The workshop on “Challenges refugees face as victims of torture” had a huge impact on the audience and generated a lively discussion. As another participant commented: “hearing these three refugees – two of whom are still not ‘in’ Canada reminds us why we do this work.” 
,  
“Everything you wanted to know about transgender rights…but were afraid to ask” workshop, led by George Harvey with guest speaker Rachel Clarke, was incredibly moving and informative. 
,  
Most workshops had special guest speakers who work outside Amnesty International, and included videos, photos and lively discussion, all of which enhanced participants’ experience and mobilized them to get more involved. 
,  
The play was staged during lunchtime and even though many in the audience knew the story, the voices of our volunteer actors brought it powerfully to life. It was a fresh, unique way to continue to engage participants and connect them with the plight of Indigenous Peoples in Guatemala on a very personal, emotional level.

The march to 519 Community Centre, was a blast of yellow signs (some made during our “Art and Revolution” workshop) and enthusiastic people!  Many of the marchers were people either new to AI or donors who told us this was their first ever AI event and they loved it! It was rewarding to see on a very hot, busy Saturday the response from passers-by, who cheered us, honked their horns and showed along the way their support for the rights of refugees and the LGBTI community. 
,  
As always with such AI events the result is the work of both staff and volunteers but special kudos need to go to the amazing planning team – our AITO volunteers – who did a SPECTACULAR job and made this event one of great learning, networking, sharing and action!

 Thank you to all participants!

Happy Pride to you and your loved ones!  Pride is a great time to really reflect on what it means to be proud of oneself and how we reflect that in our lives.  To understand Pride, one must first understand Shame.  The concept of shame is something that we don’t acknowledge nearly enough.  It is such a destructive force and it is entirely learned. Someone taught us that we should be ashamed of who we are. That our bodies don’t conform to an unrealistic standard set by a ridiculously influential advertising culture. Someone taught us that the constructs of gender were the only way humanity was made and that deviations from this were reasons to feel ashamed. Someone taught us that the colour of our skin should not be a reason to celebrate but a source of discrimination and shame. We’ve been told that the people we love and how we express our love is a reason to hate oneself.  That consenting adults need to conform to a love as outlined by shame and express that love within the absurd limits of that shame. 
The culture of shame is incredibly destructive. It has created draconian laws that has led to people being beaten, tortured, tormented, harassed, and murdered.  That shame has eaten away at the human spirit to such an extent that the person sees no option but to end their life. It prevents people from expressing themselves. From aspiring to great heights and encourage others to do the same. Our shame has held us back for far too long. It has saturated our culture and our identity. And it has to stop. 
This Pride season, don’t just be present. Be proud. Celebrate who you are in all your beauty. Celebrate that every wrinkle, grey hair (or no hair), extra inch, age spot is a souvenir of a laugh with friends, of a hard battle, of a beautiful moment, of a time that you enjoyed, and enjoyed to its fullest. Celebrate that your gender identity is not going to be dictated by the many, but is a beautiful expression of who you are and that the steps that you make toward realizing it are beautiful and brave and worth shouting from the rooftops with pride. Celebrate that your sexuality, something that is so personal and deeply rooted in your spirit is not a source of shame. That it is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to love and to be loved and that the relationships we have, regardless of duration, are exquisite moments of beauty and triumph in the face of that shame. Celebrate that you are a person of worth. That a lifetime of shame leads to a lifetime of regret and we have the opportunity here to break that cycle. 
In the work that we do we have campaigned against some pretty horrifying things. An angry mob forcing a young man to leap to his death. A young woman violently raped so that she can correct her “misguided sexual behaviour.” An LGBTI organization shut down by the authorities. We have seen horrific laws passed and a beautiful group of people silenced by their governments. It is so easy to be discouraged at the world. To lose all faith in humanity. To give into that shame and confine your actions within those limits. But we have also seen so many reasons to hope. We have seen men and women of all ages, orientations, and colours march for the rights of refugees, parading through the street in a bold refusal to be pushed from society.  We have seen transgender men and women fight through tears to reveal their life story and struggles, with the aim of explaining to Canadians why bills like C-279 on gender identity are so important. We have seen people who could have remained silent, who could have lived their lives without a fuss, raise their voice and demand rights. Demand that all people are entitled to a life of dignity. There is no force in this world that can take that from you. 
When we are proud of who we are we break te cycle of shame. When we rejoice in who we are and how we express it we don’t just do it for ourselves. We do it for the next generation. We do it for our society, so that our citizens know that people come in all shapes, colours, and genders and that our individuality is what makes us beautiful. We do it for those we have lost, the people who have been murdered, tortured, shamed into suicide. So that we can create a world where this will never happen again.  It sounds cheesy, it is true. It sounds like a dream. like something that can never happen.  This is because we have let shame remove this as a possibility.  It is time to claim that future back. It is time to let every amazing possibility in our future be available. 
This Pride season be safe.  Be happy.  Be proud.

But her past and present experiences give her precious little to smile about. 
Zeinah arrived in Turkey four months ago, having fled her native Syria. 
Like other Syrians I met in Istanbul, Zeinah had experienced horrors in her country of origin, and was desperate to start a new life. A teacher by profession, she was jailed by the Bashar al-Assad regime for allegedly providing assistance to opposition groups. She said she was raped and beaten multiple times over the several months she spent in prison and was eventually released due to lack of evidence. 
The abuse she suffered in jail has left her with injuries to her spine – and serious psychological trauma – which remain untreated. 
Although Syrians in Turkey are entitled to visit hospitals free of charge, this right is not always implemented in practice. Zeinah was able to get an MRI scan and a diagnosis at a local hospital, but she doesn’t have enough money to pay for the medicines she needs. Furthermore, the abuse she experienced urgently requires that she obtain psychological and other support, which she is not receiving in Istanbul. 
Zeinah’s story is not unique. Like her, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees are struggling to survive in Turkey and in other countries. 
When we spoke in Istanbul last week she had just been evicted from her fourth home since arriving in the city. She said she had already paid her rent, but the owner of the building told her she had to leave immediately – no reason was given. 
There were five women living in a two-bedroom apartment. Zeinah shared her 3m by 2m room with two others. Her rent consumed $250 of the $350 she earned each month making bags. 
But now she was being denied capriciously even these cramped and overpriced lodgings. Because she was smuggled into Turkey, she had nowhere to turn when she was evicted. Zeinah has no passport and is not registered with the Turkish authorities. Non-governmental organizations I spoke with told me that for people without documentation in Turkey, complaining to the police can lead to detention. 
While she was speaking with me Zeinah kept apologizing, saying she was afraid that her story would give me nightmares. But I felt that it was me who should apologize, on behalf of Canada – my home country – and other wealthy nations of the world who remain shamefully inactive in resettling refugees from Syria. Meanwhile this crisis, which aid organizations are calling the worst humanitarian disaster in recent history, worsens daily. 
Remarkably, as we said goodbye she told me “I am still hopeful”. The courage and resilience of people like Zeinah demand not only our admiration; they demand action.

Her mother and father had been arrested in Nairobi as part of the counter-terrorism operation dubbed ‘Usalama Watch’. 
They were detained in Kasarani stadium before being forcibly relocated to Kakuma refugee camp over 800km away, leaving Ayaan alone to look after her seven brothers and sisters – all under the age of 10. 
“It is only me looking after the children” says Ayaan. “My parents were both working, but now we have very little. The children are out of school. I want my parents to come back.” 
Ayaan’s experience is far from unique for refugees in Kenya today. 
During the course of operation Usalama Watch, more than 300 children have been separated from their families. Even breastfeeding mothers have been separated from their babies and forcibly sent to refugee camps, leaving infants, some as young as one month old, behind. 
Since the operation began, many refugee children have stopped attending school either through fear or circumstance. As a result, hardworking students are desperately worried about dropping behind whilst others find that they can no longer sit the exams for which they had been preparing. 
The Somali community in Kenya have been disproportionately targeted by the current security operations. Thousands have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, harassment, extortion and ill-treatment since Usalama Watch began in early April. 
At least 2500 people have been forcibly relocated to overcrowded, insecure refugee camps and hundreds of others have been expelled back to Somalia, despite the deteriorating security situation there. 
Amnesty International is not aware of any Somali arrested during the operation who has been charged with terrorism-related offences, let alone convicted. Somalis are being treated as scapegoats. 
Despite their marginalization, many Somalis have played an important part in Kenya’s economic and cultural life, running businesses and boosting the economy. This contribution is now under attack. 
No one denies that Kenya faces legitimate security concerns. But victimizing an entire community is not the way to deal with insecurity, and will only breed hostility. Meanwhile families continue to be torn apart and livelihoods lost. 
Children are being separated from their parents and are missing out on their education. All the while, attacks keep happening. 
World Refugee Day gives us the opportunity to reflect on the suffering of people forced to leave their countries in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster. 
As one Kenyan man said, “It is not my wife’s fault she had to flee for her life, and become a refugee. It is not my daughter’s fault for being born to this world by a refugee parent. She has had to suffer for being who she doesn’t even know she is. A refugee’s child.” This year, as these stories demonstrate, it is not a day on which we can be proud.

It was two years ago that courageous Indigenous women and men in Colombia sent photo messages to Canada to tell us about deadly assaults on their lives and lands. 
Photo messages like the one from this Kankuamo woman – who writes “We want to live in peace on our lands” – put faces on an acute yet hidden human rights emergency. The very survival of more than a third of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, including the Kankuamo, is in jeopardy amidst attacks, forced displacement and the imposition of resource extraction projects that are increasing with promotion by Canada’s free trade agreement with Colombia. 
Indigenous rights defenders in Colombia, many of them threatened with death for their vital work, urged us to speak out with them. In attention-grabbing numbers, you have done just that! 
Thousands of you signed our post cards to President Santos of Colombia, while thousands more signed actions to Canada’s Foreign Minister, to your MP and to Canada’s International Trade Minister. Others sent unique, eye-catching photo messages to express your concern. 
At the end of April, we brought your photos and your appeals for action to Ottawa and handed them over to the government, following a press conference and public demonstration on the steps of Parliament (below). In total, more than 65,000 people signed actions calling for immediate measures to protect the rights and survival of Indigenous peoples on their lands in Colombia. 
 
Together, we have made a long over-looked, devastating crisis for Indigenous peoples in Colombia visible. We have also made visible a growing call for action from every part of our country! 
Major media including the Ottawa Citizen, Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, CBC and Global TV have covered the story. Important organizations like the Assembly of First Nations have joined with us to speak out. So too have influential figures like retired-General Roméo Dallaire, outgoing chair of Parliament’s Working Group for the Prevention of Genocide. 
All of this is highly appreciated by our partners at the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia. They know that only a strong, relentless outcry from inside – and outside – Colombia can halt ongoing, grave human rights violations, especially in areas earmarked for resource extraction projects. 
Sadly, Canada chose not to acknowledge this emergency – nor to examine the foot print of Canadian resource extraction companies in Colombia – in the federal government’s recently released 2014 report on human rights effects of the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Click here to learn more about this disturbing omission. 
But Canada has spoken out – via the Embassy in Bogotá – expressing concern to the Colombian government about the safety of threatened Embera Chami Indigenous leader Flaminio Onogama Gutiérrez (right), echoing your appeals for effective measures to protect him from harm so he can continue to defend the rights of his people. The Colombian government has now committed to carefully investigate the threats he faces and initiated an investigation into the murder of Flaminio’s nephews Berlain Saigama Gutiérrez and Jhon Braulio Saigama. Progress on this emblematic case is incredibly important. Your calls for action have played a crucial role. 
Much more is needed, given continuing assaults against Indigenous leaders and organizations asserting the rights of Indigenous peoples to decision-making about economic projects, including resource extraction, that affect their lands, livelihoods and future.  
Just last month, 15 year-old Génesis Gisselle Gutiérrez Romero in the Wayúu Indigenous Reserve of Zahíno was traumatized by a phone call warning that she and her family would be killed. The teenager’s mother Jakeline Romero Epiayu (photographed with a sign that reads “Respect my territory”) belongs to a women’s organization called Fuerza Mujeres Wayúu and recently travelled to Europe to speak out about the many dangers women face since large-scale coal mining was imposed in their region. Amongst them is an epidemic of sexual violence against Indigenous women perpetrated by state security forces and illegal armed groups alike. Indigenous women face three-fold discrimination because of their gender, ethnicity and social class. Colombia’s highest court has called for measures to protect Indigenous women, and warned that the Wayúu people face “physical and cultural extermination”. Yet the assaults continue. Indigenous women like Génesis Gisselle and Jakeline remain at grave risk. 
That’s why your ongoing support is so vital. Please click here to take action now. Please be sure to send a copy of your message to Canada’s Foreign Minister. Thank you for raising your voice!

Believing that the media was a tool that he could use, he wanted to tell the story of his people to the world.  Telling these stories was a way to protect his people and bring peace to his country.  He faced horrible obstacles.  His land became a place of massacre.  At a certain point, he became helpless and lost the power to speak the truth and fight for freedom.  He had few choices – die, surrender to the Government and become a journalist of propaganda, or flee.  After his family was threatened because of his work, Maran fled. 
Leaving his family, he paid a smuggler who promised to take him to a country where he would be safe. He had no choice about the country, only a small hope that he would eventually be safe. 
Joining 75 other refugees, he was taken to an old rusted cargo ship and set out to sea.  The journey was perilous and on a number of occasions Maran believed he would die at sea.  They faced eight storms on the journey, during which they were tossed about in the lower deck of the ship like footballs kicked around a field. 
  
In October 2009, planes appeared in the sky above the ship.  Maran believed he had found safety.   Upon arrival, all the passengers on the ship were arrested and held at gunpoint.  They were put in a prison and all of their belongings were confiscated, including the journal Maran had written on the voyage.  He had no idea what was happening and it was only by watching the television in the prison he found that all of the passengers on the ship were being portrayed as terrorists, and a threat to the safety and security of Canada. 
Maran arrived in Canada on a ship called the Ocean Lady.  He and the others on the ship were Tamils who had fled northern Sri Lanka, which in the summer of 2009 had become a place of massacre.  After all of his ordeals, nothing was more painful to him than being portrayed as a terrorist to Canadians. 
“For three years the Canadian government treated me with suspicion as a terrorist, as part of a propaganda campaign against refugees. This is not who I am. I am a human being who cares about other human beings. I am a journalist. My task is to make the world a safe and beautiful place for human beings,” says Maran. 
Some, like Maran, resort to potentially deadly journeys; and cross deserts or oceans in search of safety.  Those who survive these journeys, like Maran often face a hostile reception in so-called ‘developed’ countries. They may face violence and intimidation from border guards including strip searches, theft, or a push back at gunpoint to the country from which they have just fled. Others are detained in cramped compounds where they endure stifling heat without adequate shade or shelter and are denied sufficient water and medical help. Many countries link refugees to criminals or terrorists and promote language which suggests refugees are a threat to our security and safety. 
  
Maran continues to carry the suffering of his people in his heart and mind, as violence and massacres continue, in countries like Sri Lanka, Syria, South Sudan, and Colombia.    All too often apathy, political alliances and point-scoring trump human rights.  While politicians and diplomats drag their feet and debate points of order, houses are being burned to the ground and families are forced to run. 
In the case of Syria, despite their relative economic disadvantage, developing countries are bearing the brunt of the crisis, with Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Pakistan the top five refugee hosting countries.  In 2013, three of those countries – Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey – registered receiving a total of 1,524,979 refugees from Syria alone. 
In contrast, the USA records resettling just 36 Syrian refugees in 2013 – although it resettles thousands more from other countries. The 28 countries of the EU have pledged to resettle 30,498 Syrians, although the vast majority – 25,500 – will be resettled in Germany. Canada reports that it has provided protection for 1300 Syrians. 
   
The self-styled world leaders are lagging far-behind the developing world when it comes to bearing the burden of the global refugee crisis. 
Maran has been recognized as a convention refugee in Canada, and with his new found freedom, he continues to advocate on behalf of those whose rights are being denied.  On World Refugee Day, Maran urges all of us to use the freedoms we have to speak out, and take action to help so many others whose rights continue to be denied so that all who need protection will be treated with humanity and dignity.

0,Boko Haram: Now What?,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-boko-haram-now-what/,"By Adotei Akwei. Johanna Lee contributed to this post. Originally published by AIUSA.   In mid-April, Islamist armed group Boko Haram abducted 276 schoolgirls aged 15-18 from the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria. The abductions triggered outrage, protests and a social media campaign...","In mid-April, Islamist armed group Boko Haram abducted 276 schoolgirls aged 15-18 from the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria. The abductions triggered outrage, protests and a social media campaign criticizing the response of the Nigerian authorities and demanding a major effort to secure the freedom of the girls. 
Yet, almost two months later, little, if any, progress has been made in freeing the kidnapped girls and the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan and his security forces have failed to communicate a plan or even convince the families of the girls that they are doing all that they can to get the girls released. 
The last update was about two weeks ago when the Nigerian army claimed to have located the girls but went on to nix any ideas of a rescue. The army did announce that an additional 20,000 soldiers were being deployed to the northern region of the country, but no details about when and where the forces would be sent was offered. 
Boko Haram continues to commit grave human rights abuses with impunity, including killing dozens of villagers living near the border with Cameroon, and killing approximately 200 people over a two-week period of attacks in the Gwoza hills. They also abducted 20 more women and three men in Borno state earlier this week. 
At the international level, the spotlight will once again return to Nigeria and the issue of stopping violence against women and girls during times of armed conflict through a gathering of international leaders at a meeting in London. 
The historic 2014 Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict has representatives from over 145 countries and will use the Chibok abductions as a focus case for discussions. The summit will be followed by a smaller security meeting focused on Nigeria and Boko Haram. 
Yet, despite these efforts, the international community continues to run into a critical problem: the Nigerian military is either unable or unwilling to clean up its act, committing systematic egregious human rights violations with impunity. 
This, correctly, has caused governments like the United States to have to think hard about what kind of assistance they should provide, how they can ensure that the assistance does not contribute to the commission of human rights abuses and to demand accountability and reform from the Nigerian military. Another equally large problem is the fact that the Nigerian authorities do not appear to be ready to change what most have concluded is a failed strategy on the Boko Haram crisis. 
Many people in the United States, understandably, continue to demand that the girls be rescued now, no matter it takes. There are calls for a rescue mission, in which the U.S. will simply march in and together with the Nigerian army in an “A-Team” fashion, free the girls and take down the bad guys in the process. 
But such a response could result in worse situation, not just for the abducted girls, but for the general population in the region. 
The debate among policy makers in the U.S. has sadly focused on incorrectly blaming U.S. laws enacted to prevent U.S. security assistance from contributing to human rights abuses, when the focus should be on the lack of political will to enact badly needed reform in Abuja. 
This same analysis also forgets why legislation like the Leahy Law is critically important to countries that receive U.S. security assistance as well as to the United States. 
Building the capacity of militaries that do not think twice about abusing their own citizens is not in anyone’s interest and has been proven to result in worse human rights abuses. 
The debates have not focused on how the U.S. can help strengthen the rule of law and accountability and address a key driver behind the worsening economic situation in northern Nigeria that is also contributing to the Boko Haram crisis: climate change and its impact on livelihoods. 
What, then, needs to be done? First, the Nigerian military must address the issue of corruption and human rights abuses inside its own house. The Nigerian military must render itself accountable for a long trail of human rights abuses going back decades. 
The friends of Nigeria, including the United States, must also work with the Nigerian government to restore the robust rule of law and demonstrate that all are accountable to the law, be it alleged members of Boko Haram or members of the Nigerian political elite or army. Faith in the government, local as well as national, and a sense of inclusion will be essential among the general population in what will be a long struggle. 
The government must start to actively respond to its citizens human rights concerns and answer difficult questions. To date, the government appears to be doing nearly nothing beyond firing generals who they have concluded colluded with Boko Haram. 
In order to push all of these critical action items, the international community needs to keep the spotlight on Abuja and the military, on Boko Haram and on the girls of Chibok , and most importantly, listen to what the people of Nigeria are saying. 
It will not be quick or easy, but it is the best way forward.

0,An impossible dream come true,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-an-impossible-dream-come-true/,"By María José  Eva Parada, South America researcher at Amnesty International. When Carlos Mareco, a leader of the Sawhoyamaxa indigenous community, heard the news that after a two decade long painful legal battle, his people will be able to return to their ancestral lands, he couldn’t help but...","When Carlos Mareco, a leader of the Sawhoyamaxa indigenous community, heard the news that after a two decade long painful legal battle, his people will be able to return to their ancestral lands, he couldn’t help but shed a tear. 
“We Indigenous People cry only when we have achieved our freedom. Today, it is like we are coming out of a prison, so many of us are crying because it is so emotional,” he said. 
For years Carlos Mareco and his community lived on a precariously narrow stretch of land by a major highway. 
Yesterday, Paraguay’s President, Horacio Cartes enacted a law approving the expropriation of more than 14,400 hectares of land in the Chaco region, returning the land to the Sawhoyamaxa. With the stroke of a pen, the Paraguayan State began undoing some of the wrongs suffered by the community for generations. 
I will never forget the first time I went to visit the community. 
It was 2012 when I arrived. Missing the ramshackle dwellings would have been easy if I hadn’t been with some of our colleagues from Tierraviva, the Paraguayan NGO that has accompanied the Sawhoyamaxa during their struggle for the land. They knew exactly where to stop. 
We were meeting some of the 160 families that make up the community. They lived in a narrow stretch of land by the Concepcion-Pozo Colorado highway. The only thing separating the community from the lands their ancestors had inhabited for generations was a fence built by the man who claimed ownership to the plot. 
The scene was shocking – but their courage, inspirational. 
Men and women, young and old, were fighting to survive with barely anything. Food and water were scarce. They lived in temperatures that reached as high as 40 degrees Celsius. Everybody was terrified of the enormous trucks that raced by the fragile wooden houses they lived in. 
The people I spoke to, who are so often treated as second-class citizens, would never have believed that the Paraguayan Congress would debate the needs of Indigenous Peoples, let alone that the President would one day find in their favour. 
But then this week the impossible happened- the President signed a law that would allow the Sawhoyama to return to their ancestral lands. 
“We lived at the side of the road, we lived terribly. Various people in the community died in accidents or through illnesses. Nobody respected us. Now, we are triumphant. I am very happy but I’m crying because my grandmother, my father and many of my family did not have the chance that I have today to enjoy our land. I’m grateful to everyone!” said Aparicia González, a member of the Sawhoyamaxa community. 
The road to victory was a long one. The legal battle of the Sawhoyamaxa began in 1991 when the community took legal action for recognition of their rights to the more than 14,000 hectares of ancestral lands in two areas now known as Retiro Santa Elisa and Estancia Michi in the north of Paraguay. 
Fifteen years later and having received no positive responses from the authorities they took their claim to the Inter American Commission of Human Rights and the Inter American Court of Human Rights, which ruled in their favour in 2006. 
Since 2009 Amnesty International’s members in Paraguay and across the world have been putting pressure on authorities to resolve the situation and ensure the Sawhoyamaxa could return home. 
Land is essential to all indigenous communities. Without it, their way of life and very survival is at risk. Without land they cannot grow food, hunt and perform their cultural traditions. Without land, they can barely survive, let alone prosper. 
This news is nothing short of incredible, and not only for the Sawhoyamaxa. 
According to official figures, there are around 108,600 Indigenous People in Paraguay – 1.7 per cent of the population – although this is likely to be a significant underestimate of the true figure. 
Most of them are invisible – discriminated against and forced to live in extremely poor conditions. Levels of poverty and illiteracy are significantly higher among Indigenous Peoples compared to the rest of the Paraguayan population. 
There are others still fighting. The indigenous community of Yakye Axa, is also waiting to return home, after the Inter American Court of Human Rights also ruled on their favour in 2005 and an agreement with the landowner of their land was reached in 2012. They are still waiting for the access to that land to be cleared. 
Now the Sawhoyamaxa are celebrating a historic victory. We can only wait to see how much longer the many others fighting for their rights to their land will have to wait.

The proposed legislation would give the federal government new powers to revoke Canadian citizenship in some cases when individuals are convicted of specified crimes related to terrorism and similar offences. The new provisions fall short of a range of international human rights obligations, including non-discrimination and fair hearing guarantees.  Consequently, Amnesty International is calling on the government to withdraw these new revocation provisions from the Bill.  
“In Canada, a government decision to revoke citizenship might affect an individual’s life, liberty or security and must only take place in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada, English speaking branch. “It is also vital that citizenship revocation not expose individuals to discrimination.  The new revocation provisions in Bill C-24 fail to meet the requirements of fundamental justice and increase the risk of individuals being exposed to discrimination.  These provisions must be withdrawn.” 
Any Canadian who has committed a serious criminal act such as terrorism should and must be held accountable for those crimes through the criminal justice system.  However, Bill C-24 exposes some Canadian citizens to the further penalty of loss of citizenship, in the case of dual nationals. 
The new revocation provisions in Bill C-24 distinguish between Canadians who have no other nationality and individuals who carry one or more other nationalities in addition to their Canadian citizenship.  Differentiating between Canadian citizens on the basis of national origin risks fueling a climate in which some Canadians are seen as ‘true’ Canadians while others are viewed as inherently suspicious or disloyal.  In that divisive climate, certain groups may find themselves exposed to discrimination. 
“These provisions would be out of step with the Canadian trend of developing an inclusive concept of citizenship”, said Béatrice Vaugrante, Directrice Générale, Amnistie international Canada francophone.  “It is the duty of governments to adopt measures that protect individuals from discrimination; but these provisions do precisely the opposite.” 
Additionally, the new revocation procedure in Bill C-24 fails to uphold the international standards that guarantee fair hearings.  For instance, the Minister is not required to specify the grounds on which he or she is making the decision. There is also no basis on which to appeal the decision. 
Amnesty International urges that fair trial requirements be observed in any process leading to possible revocation of citizenship.  At a minimum these serious deficiencies with respect to the fairness of the revocation procedure must be addressed. 
Background 
Citizenship is a human right, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It plays an important role in ensuring protection from other human rights violations, such as deportation.  At present, Canadian citizenship can only be lost through misrepresentation or fraud.  Many Canadian citizens may have a second nationality and are unaware of it. This could be because of family connections (including birthplace of a parent or grandparent), marriage to a foreign national or extended residency in another country.

Her desperate act showed the depth of her pain and despair: she must have felt that nobody was there to help her. 
We soon learned that Amina had been raped in her small Moroccan town, by a man she was then forced to marry. Imagine being married to your rapist, to be forced to see that person all the time – it would be devastating.  
He married her because Moroccan law allows rapists to escape prosecution by marrying their victim, if she is aged under 18. 
Amina’s death caused an outcry in Morocco and throughout the region. What shocked people most was that this marriage was sanctioned by law, as well as by a judge who authorized it. It revealed that the state was complicit in covering up a rape. And instead of protecting her as the victim of a crime, the law victimized Amina a second time.  
This kind of legislation doesn’t just exist in Morocco, but also in Algeria and Tunisia.  
This legal environment prevents women and girls from reporting rape. A victim is not considered as a survivor of a grave act of violence. 
Amina’s story resonated with another case in Tunisia, where a young woman complained to the police about being raped by two police officers, and ended up being charged herself for “indecency”. 
Women and girls who suffer sexual violence are seen as the problem. The accusation is always: what have you done to bring this on yourself? Unbelievably, in Morocco the punishment for rapists is also different depending on whether the victim was a virgin or not. 
In conservative societies, there is this misplaced idea that women and girls can bring their family into disrepute and that the value of a girl or a young woman lies in her virginity. People will try to hide a rape and might arrange a marriage as a way to prevent shame on the family. 
It is as if the rape is not about violence against a girl or a woman, but about her worth. She could be seen as a family commodity in a culture where getting married and having children is presented as a woman’s main goal in life. The underlying assumption of the law is that to get married, a woman must be a virgin. If she is raped, she is damaged goods. 
	In a patriarchal society, marrying a woman off to her rapist could also be seen as a way of protecting the victim, preserving her “honour”. The underlying idea is that it’s better to be married than to be an outcast. 
Amina’s desperate act, and the outcry that followed, finally exposed this ugly reality. It can no longer be swept under the carpet: it needs to be confronted and the law brought into line with the society we live in. 
Women’s rights are often labelled by people in the region who oppose them as a Western concept. Remarkably, Amina’s family stood with her and joined the street protests sparked by her death. They are not from the capital, and are not well educated. 
This shows that Moroccan society is ready for change. But that doesn’t mean that its leaders are. The Moroccan authorities quickly announced that they would change the law that allowed Amina’s rapist to marry her, but it hasn’t happened yet. How many more Aminas have we had since her suicide? 
Rape is one of the most extreme forms of violence against women and girls. The state has a responsibility to make sure that the law, the police and the justice system are there to protect women.  
And we have a responsibility to remember Amina. We can do that by making sure that no other woman or girl is forced to follow her tragic path. Rapists need to know that there is no way to escape prison. And victims need to be supported, rather than stigmatized.	Women and men across North Africa are fighting against discriminatory laws. International solidarity through Amnesty’s forthcoming My Body My Rights campaign will be crucial for supporting their struggle. 
For example, when reports emerged about forced “virginity tests” in Egypt, women were accused of lying, of trying to tarnish the image of the army. One woman told us that an Amnesty press release, publicly stating that she had been sexually assaulted, made her feel able to walk with her head held high again. Suddenly, she was seen as a survivor of an act of violence. 
If we can push outdated laws and ideas of shame into the history books, we can prevent another story like Amina’s.

It’s time to set the record straight, writes Aurelia Dondo, North Africa campaigner. 
Our message was clear. Women and girls have the right to live free from sexual violence and have the right to bodily integrity. These rights are known in international law as sexual and reproductive rights. They are universal human rights and governments must ensure they are respected, protected and fulfilled. But some within the Moroccan media were quick to distort the message. 
By depicting Amnesty International as an imperialist organization encouraging sexual misconduct, these media outlets twisted the debate and muddied the issue. In doing so, they disregarded the plight of the survivors of sexual violence we are campaigning for. 
Women and girls have the right to live free from rape and other forms of sexual violence. Yet discriminatory and harmful provisions in Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian laws not only fail to protect survivors of sexual violence, they further stigmatize and victimize them. 
Amina Filali was just 16 years old when she took her own life. A few months earlier, the Moroccan teenager had been forced to marry the man she said had raped her. Her death exposed the appalling reality that this marriage had been sanctioned by law. 
In January 2014, nearly two years after Amina’s death, the Moroccan parliament unanimously voted to amend the get-out clause that allowed men accused of rape to walk free by marrying their victim, if she was aged under 18. Sadly, similar provisions still exist in Tunisia and Algeria. 
The very assumptions underlying such clauses are deeply flawed. They emphasize family honour and shame while dismissing the needs of survivors of sexual violence. 
When we said that unmarried consenting adults should not be criminalized for having sex, we were met by accusations of sexual impropriety. Yet these types of laws discourage rape survivors from filing complaints out of fear of being themselves accused of illegal behaviour. 
Laws based on “morality” and “decency” have been used against survivors of sexual violence. In a case that provoked outrage in Tunisia, a 27 year-old woman known only as Meriem Ben Mohamed said she was raped by two police officers in September 2012. Instead of investigating her complaint, the authorities accused her of indecency. 
Survivors of sexual violence often find they have nowhere to turn for help. We are campaigning to make sure that they not only have the support they need, but also have the means to get justice. If a woman or girl gets pregnant as a result of rape or incest, then she should have access to safe and legal abortion services. Being forced to carry such a pregnancy to term is a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Justice for survivors also means that police, judges and health workers are properly trained to respond in a sensitive, confidential and non-discriminatory way. 
So let me ask this question: Is it ok to rape women and girls? Everyone will say no. However, when Amnesty campaigns for the rights of survivors of rape and other forms of sexual violence, we are accused of encouraging sexual misconduct. Saying you are against rape and then turning a blind eye to the plight of survivors of sexual violence is just empty rhetoric. 
Amnesty International together with brave activists will stand by survivors of sexual violence, to at least ensure that the state protects rather than further victimizes them. So criticize, and let’s debate. Stigma, social taboos, bigotry or cultural relativism must be challenged when they stand in the way of women’s rights. The Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian authorities must abolish these discriminatory and harmful laws once and for all. They must also make sure that the legal, social and medical needs of survivors of sexual violence are met. As the tragic case of Amina showed the world, delays are costing lives.

,  
A few years ago I heard a young First Nations woman describing the unsafe drinking water, the poor quality school and other conditions that she faced every day growing up in her home community. “What did we do to be treated like this?” she asked. 
,  
In most communities in Canada, government services like education, health care and family services are provided by a combination of municipal and provincial governments. However, in the case of First Nations people living on reserves these services are instead funded through the federal government. 
,  
Critically, study after study has shown that federal funding for basic services on reserves routinely falls short of what is required to provide First Nations families with access to the same quality of services–  like education and health care — enjoyed other communities in Canada. 
, 	Here’s what the Auditor General of Canada had to say about the situation in 2011: 
,  
“The education gap between First Nations living on reserves and the general Canadian population has widened, the shortage of adequate housing on reserves has increased, comparability of child and family services is not ensured.” 
,  
It’s little wonder if some First Nations children youth feel that they’re being punished for being Indigenous. 
,  
The federal government’s failure to ensure adequate services for families on First Nations reserves is a fundamentally unfair situation that has terrible consequences for this generation of First Nations youth. But things don’t have to be this way. Not if Canadians demand fairness and equity for all children. 
,  
That’s why Amnesty International is supporting our Dreams Matter Too, a national initiative to raise awareness of the basic inequalities facing First Nations children. This Wednesday, June 11th, walks and rallies will be held in communities across Canada. The message is simple: First Nations children should have the chance as every other child to grow up safely at home, get a good education, be healthy, and be proud of their cultures. 
,  
Our Dreams Matter Too marks the anniversary of Canada’s apology to the survivors of Residential Schools. In that apology, the Government of Canada, on behalf of all Canadians, made the important statement, “There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again.” 
,  
Our Dreams Matter Too is an opportunity to hold the federal government to that promise. 
,

The atmosphere in the square was electric – unlike anything I had ever experienced – as groups of students, workers and other ordinary citizens engaged in lively debates about corruption, freedom, their rights and the country’s leadership.

Sounds simple enough. But unlike the plot of an episode of an action drama, the reality on the ground is much more complex. 
While we all hope for the girls to be freed and returned safely to their families, truth is that a rescue operation will only put a temporary band aid on much larger issues that will eventually generate copycat actions. 
The people of Nigeria will continue to be at risk of abuses by armed groups like Boko Haram and their own government’s military forces alike. This raises serious questions of what kind of support should be given to the Nigerian government and its military as well as whether the U.S. government plans to rigorously monitor such security assistance. 
This situation also demands a genuine global gut check of the commitment of the Nigerian authorities to clean up their act responsibly and rethink their approach following what is being universally condemned as a botched response to the abduction and to the Boko Haram insurgency. 
If one were to start by asking the proverbial “what the hell is going on?” the answer would have to start with Boko Haram, of which surprisingly little is known apart from where they have struck, what their tactics are and what they purport to be fighting for. Amnesty International and other human rights groups have been documenting abuses perpetrated by them and raising concerns about their tactics going back to 2009, and the facts are brutal. 
Even as people are appalled and outraged by the abduction of nearly 300 girls, the families of another 2,700 individuals have also lost loved ones as a result of Boko Haram’s tactics and those of the Nigerian security forces, and there has not been one trial or conviction of an alleged member of Boko Haram in the last 5 years. Surely those individuals also deserve justice if not a global campaign as has been generated on behalf of the Chibok girls to call for justice 
Further complicating delusions of a comic-book type rescue mission is the record of the Nigerian authorities, who are and must be the lead on any response to Boko Haram. It’s taking place in their own backyard. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan vowed to crush Boko Haram in 2013. His government imposed a state of emergency in three states in northern Nigeria, created an information blackout, and unleashed a scorched earth campaign involving a reported 8,000 person military task force that also included local recruited civilian militias. There were reports of the use of helicopter gunships and jet fighters. 
While it does not appear to have incapacitated Boko Haram very much, it has turned northern Nigeria into a nightmare of an internal armed conflict for people living there who are caught between a rock and a hard place. 
The abuses by the Nigerian security forces are unfortunately nothing new. In a report on the ongoing practice of torture globally that was released this week, Amnesty International noted that: 
“There is evidence of increasing use of torture in Nigeria. Amnesty International’s recent research indicates that police and military personnel routinely use torture to extract information and “confessions,” and to punish and exhaust detainees. In contravention of national and international law, information extracted by torture and ill-treatment is routinely accepted as evidence in court. The authorities apparently lack the political will to adhere to international human rights obligations.” 
 
In 2013, Amnesty International reported on an increase in the size and activities of military detention centers where thousands of perceived Muslim men who were rounded up off the streets based on nothing more than being Muslim or appearing as such to the security forces, were taken and where they were tortured and ill-treated to the point that many of them did not come out alive. 
Concerns over the performance of the Nigerian security forces in northern Nigeria go back to 2009, with reports of unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, and deaths in military and police custody. On March 14, more than 600 people, mainly former detainees, were killed by security forces following an attack by Boko Haram on the military barracks in Maiduguri. 
For the rest of West Africa, the United States and the global community, pushing the Nigerian government to re-think its strategy must become utmost priority, even as efforts to find the abducted girls continue. Key among the reforms that the country’s allies should be pushing for would be restoring the rule of law and accountability for abuses committed by the Nigerian military as well as for the abuses committed by members of Boko Haram. 
All judicial proceedings must take place in an impartial court of law in line with international standards. Those kinds of reforms demand resources and leadership not by the U.S. Department of Defense, but by other arms of the United States government. The United States must also be fully transparent about the security assistance it is giving to ensure that it is does not fuel even more questionable human rights practices by the Nigerian government. 
None of these are one-off, media-friendly solutions, but the sooner we realize what we need to do, the better chance we have of preventing more Boko Harams from emerging and deploying this terrible tactic again and again.

But as Messi, Neymar and Rooney come face to face, outside Brazil’s shiny new stadiums another more serious standoff is taking place – one in which the ‘rules’ are being openly flouted. 
Since June 2013, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in unprecedented numbers of cities and towns across Brazil demanding better public services, including transport, among other rights. Many of them complain that authorities are paying too much attention to FIFA’s demands and too little to the needs of their own people. 
The response of the authorities has been nothing short of disgraceful. 
Military police units sent to keep the protests “under control” have not hesitated for a second before shooting tear gas at peaceful protesters – in one case even inside a hospital. They have fired rubber bullets and beat men and women with batons despite them posing no threat. 
Hundreds have been injured in the course of the many protests that have taken place since then. They include Sérgio Andrade da Silva, a 32-year-old photographer who lost his eye after being hit by a rubber bullet during a mass demonstration in São Paulo in June 2013. 
Left with only one eye, Sérgio, who is married and has two children, now finds it difficult to work. So far he has not received an official apology or offer of compensation from the authorities, let alone any investigation into the acts of the security forces that led to his injury. 
In another case in January this year, another demonstrator – university student Vinicius Duarte – was left with a broken jaw and nose after being viciously beaten by police. At the time, Vinicius was standing inside a hotel, taking shelter from the tear gas shot by police outside. 
The examples go on. They are scandalous, but far from surprising. 
While there have been some acts of violence committed by small groups among the generally peaceful protesters, the disproportionate response by the security forces has further reduced the public space for those who want to express their right to express their dissent through peaceful demonstrations. The accidental killing of the cameraman Santiago Andrade, in February 2014, by a firework launched by protesters has since then been manipulated to criminalize protests. 
Brazil’s security forces have an extremely poor record when it comes to dealing with protests. In fact, although local officials in cities including São Paulo have announced internal investigations into allegations of excessive use of force by the police during protests, as far as we know, to date no one has been subjected to criminal or disciplinary proceedings. 
 
That impunity, combined with the lack of training for officers who simply do not know the legal limits when it comes to using force, results in a dangerous cocktail in which nearly anyone walking on the streets during a protest risks being injured. 
Authorities in some cities have even announced they are considering relying on the military, already in place to support the World Cup, to police demonstrations expected to take place when the world’s eyes are trained on the pitch. Not a good idea given the lack of training of the country’s military in policing roles. 
As Brazil prepares to host the biggest sporting event of the year, “complaining” is often seen as trying to “spoil the party” – and authorities will stop at nothing to ensure the celebration goes well. 
A raft of laws meant to prevent and punish organized crime, for example, has been wrongly used to prosecute people accused of acting violently and/or attacking private property during the protests. 
In one case in São Paulo, Brazil’s National Security Law, which dates back to the days of the military regime from 1964 to 1985, was applied to justify arresting and interrogating protesters. 
Several new law proposals, including a counter-terrorism law, are being discussed in the Congress, risking further criminalization of protesters. 
If passed, it will establish a broad definition of terrorism which would, among other things, extend to damage to goods and essential services. Many are concerned the new law might be misused against demonstrators. 
Proposals to ban the use of masks during all demonstrations are also being discussed. 
Yet it is far from clear why tougher legislation is needed. Brazil already has an array of legal tools to deal with violations committed during demonstrations. 
Instead of passing harsher laws, what Brazil needs is to develop a well-trained security force that can properly police demonstrations in line with international standards, and systems to hold to account security officers who step out of line and violate human rights. This is necessary not just during the World Cup, but beyond it. 
For the month starting on 12 June, much of the world will turn their TVs on, switch off from reality, and follow the every move of dozens of men chasing a ball in cities around Brazil. 
But Amnesty International will also be keeping an eye on the chilling action taking place off the pitch. No referees will be present as the police and protesters square off, but we’ll be ready to blow the whistle when we spot foul play.

Her father was an ardent pro-democracy campaigner living in exile in Montreal, Canada since the early 1980s. 
The tragic events of the 1989 demonstrations in Beijing hold special resonance for Ti-Anna Wang. Born the same year, she was named after the Tiananmen Square protests. Her father was an ardent pro-democracy campaigner living in exile in Montreal, Canada since the early 1980s. 
Discussing politics and human rights was familiar for Ti-Anna. Her father, Wang Bingzhang, travelled the world advocating for human rights China. And while the family lived secure in the knowledge that they were safe in Montreal, they did not realize how far the tentacles of the Chinese security services could reach. 
In 2002, when she was only 13, Ti-Anna’s mother sat her and her two older brothers in the living room of their flat. Their father wasn’t coming home. 
Wang Bingzhang had been on a trip to Viet Nam. Following a meeting with fellow activists, he was abducted by two men and smuggled across the border to China. 
“At the time, I didn’t understand the severity of the situation. I thought it had been a big misunderstanding, that it would be just a matter of time before justice prevailed.” 
After being held for six months in incommunicado detention, Wang Bingzhang was charged with espionage and terrorism. The trial lasted one day and he was sentenced to life in prison. 
More than two decades later, Ti-Anna’s father is still languishing in a Chinese jail. 
“I really thought that maybe it was just a mistake that they had the wrong person and that it wouldn’t be long before this blows over and that everything would be fine. I never thought it would drag on for over 20 years.” 
As the years passed and the prospect of not seeing her father free again started to sink in, Ti-Anna decided to take matters into her own hands. 
She first approached others who, like her, had their parents unfairly imprisoned in China. A pattern of abuse began to emerge: persecution of human rights activists, trumped up charges and unfair trials: the abuses that had taken place in Tiananmen many years before were not a thing of the past. 
“I’ve always felt that if I can’t get him released the second best thing would be for him to know that his sacrifice had not been in vain. I feel it is my responsibility to keep sharing his story because in a sense I’m privileged to be able to do this.” 
Since his abduction in 2002, Ti-Anna has only been able to see her father in Shaoguan prison in a city near Hong Kong on three occasions. Separated by a glass wall – each meeting took place in rooms closely monitored by prison guards and lasted just 30 minutes. 
“The last ten years have really taken a huge tool on his psychological wellbeing. He is kept in solitary confinement most of the time and he has very limited interaction with others. He is very fragile,” Ti-Anna explained. 
And if the meetings were not tough enough, getting there proves an immense challenge. 
“The whole thing is very draining. Everything is very rushed because the prison guards give you specific dates in which you can visit and usually by the time they tell you there isn’t much time to get ready. You have to apply for your visa, book your tickets, it’s all very rushed. Then you are there for a couple of days and you come back. But the most difficult part is leaving, because I know I’m going back home to my house in Montreal, but at the same time I’m leaving my father behind,” she said. 
When Ti-Anna turned 19, she moved to Washington for a year to lobby	congress members to put pressure on the Chinese authorities to review	her father’s case. 
But then, events took a turn for the worst. In what she believes is punishment for her outspoken activism in the USA, the limited visits came to a halt. 
“That’s been really difficult because sometimes you ask yourself whether you are making things worse, it feels like the situation might be regressing and not progressing.” 
But despite all the hurdles over the years, Ti-Anna draws inspiration from her father and the activists who once stood defiant in Tiananmen. She refuses to lose hope. 
“The last thing you want is for him to be forgotten together with the other thousands of political prisoners in China. With the international attention at least hopefully he’ll be safe. I feel doing something is better than doing nothing at all.”

Originally published by Amnesty International UK 
It is our duty to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen protests and crackdown, as Amnesty and as ordinary people outside china. We should do it because we can. 
The opening phrase of a book, The Drowned and the Saved by Primo Levi, an Italian Jewish chemist and writer who survived the holocaust, has always stuck with me; it quotes a letter from a Nazi soldier who said that the victims of the holocaust would not get to write the history of the holocaust, because they would not exist. History belongs to the victor. 
In a recent poll of students in China, only 1 in 10 was able to identify an image which, for the rest of the world, is iconic. There are few global events with which an image is as entrenched as the Tiananmen protests is with ‘Tank Man’. 
Legal scholar and human rights activist Xu Zhiyong (left) was sentenced to four years in jail. 
These activists have been prosecuted simply for exercising their rights to assembly and free speech.  
 
Yet hardly any of those approached could identify the picture, or talk about its context. There are two possible explanations for that collective act of forgetting. The first is that the Chinese government’s attempt to confine the events of 1989 to an Orwellian ‘memory hole’ has been successful. That’s highly likely. The extreme censorship of both physical history books and online accounts related to Tiananmen, shows the deplorable lengths the authorities are prepared to go in their efforts to wipe the bloodshed from memory.  Even our own relatively humble event in London this week, Reclaiming Tiananmen, has been the subject of an apparent sabotage campaign. Thousands of phantom mass-ticket-bookings had been attempted so that the event appeared sold out, presumably by someone supportive of the Chinese government’s repressive aims. 
But there is also another explanation about the students’ apparent ignorance of the ‘Tank Man’ image; they knew it, but they were scared to say it. Over recent weeks the unprecedented levels of arrests of anyone attempting to commemorate Tiananmen have been testament to the Chinese authorities’ determination to bury it. You can understand why it’s wise to forget. 
Brilliant novels and plays have imagined who this man was, and what he was thinking. We may never know what became of him for sure. His legacy though is one of defiance in the face of hugely disproportionate might. 
The refusal to ‘back down’ or ‘go home’ has added resonance today. Amnesty is currently hosting a photographic exhibition of ‘The Other Images of Tiananmen’ which chronicles the 1989 protests throughout April and May, before the brutal crackdown of June. In those images it is clear that the Tiananmen protests had much in common with recent ‘Occupy’-style demonstrations. People can be seen camping, sharing food, giving talks from podiums, and singing. These were ordinary people; students, academics, farmers, factory workers, brothers, sisters, parents. There is no indication of what was to come. 
The crackdown when it came, 25 years ago today, was brutal and brief. Unarmed civilians faced tanks and bullets. There was only ever going to be one victor. 
But who does history belong to? 25 years on, the authorities may prefer pre-emptive detention to the tank, but the motivation is the same: Fear. Fear of the people. Against all the odds, Tank Man has got Goliath on the run.

The questions came fast and sharp as the 2014 Stockholm Internet Forum (#SIF14) kicked off yesterday. 
Given that the theme of this year’s conference is “Internet — privacy, transparency, surveillance and control”, why was Edward Snowden not invited? The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ response, that there were limited places for participants and that they had to ensure gender diversity, did not cut the mustard with participants, judging by comments on Twitter and in the hallways. 
One of the most surprising things since Edward Snowden started his revelations nearly a year ago is that there haven’t been significant disclosures about surveillance practices elsewhere in the world. The USA’s NSA, Britain’s GCHQ and the rest of the “Five Eyes Alliance” spy agencies cannot be the only ones engaging in mass surveillance, but we’ve seen very little about other countries’ practices. This only highlights the incredible risk involved in exposing the unlawful practices of security agencies, even in countries that consider themselves democratic. 
‘National security’ is one of the main reasons governments cite when they restrict human rights – online or elsewhere. It can be a legitimate reason to restrict certain rights, including privacy, but this must be within the strict rules of necessity and proportionality. But in reality, national security is very often abused and used as a pretext for all sorts of human rights violations, from torture, to arbitrary detention and silencing of divergent opinions. When it comes to the behaviour of spy agencies, ‘national security’ is trotted out by default. Secrecy laws, criminalization of the disclosure of information and intimidation are used to quash attempts to expose the excesses of security agencies. And of course, national security is used to justify indiscriminate mass surveillance by spy agencies across the world. 
Edward Snowden exposed a programme of unlawful surveillance that violates the privacy of millions of people worldwide. The US government charged him under the Espionage Act, which would preclude him from launching a public interest whistle-blowing defence under US law. If prosecuted and found guilty, he could face imprisonment of up to 10 years per charge. This would amount to persecution of a whistleblower who exposed massive human rights violations on a global scale. 
But, the US government has not stopped at this. For a year, it has exercised its political muscle to pressure various governments to prevent Snowden from entering their countries or even crossing their airspace. As a result, he is living with temporary asylum in Russia and several European governments have blocked attempts, including by parliamentarians, to invite him to speak in their countries. 
Detractors who criticize his disclosures ignore the extreme secrecy under which surveillance programmes have been running for years. Without whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, the excesses of security agencies, and particularly spy agencies, will remain hidden. Government officials who authorize them will remain shielded from accountability. 
This is why the protection of whistleblowers is critical to the rule of law and the protection of human rights. Those who uncover corruption and human rights violations by government agencies must be able to reveal the truth to the public without fear of retribution and criminal sanctions. This does not negate legitimate public security concerns. The Tshwane Principles strike a balance between legitimate government actions, human rights and whistle-blowing. Drafted by 22 national and global organizations in consultation with 500 experts from 70 countries, they can serve as a guiding set of principles for governments. 
The oft-repeated mantra is that we should have no expectation of privacy on the internet. Governments who want to spy on their people and companies that profit from our data want us to believe this, and accept it. 
But we should not. Privacy is one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is legally enforceable in most of the world. We must hold governments to account when they violate our privacy and to do this we need the whistleblowers.

Meriam Yehya Ibrahim is a Sudanese citizen sentenced to 100 lashes and death by hanging. She was convicted by a Sudanese court for marrying someone supposedly of another faith and for refusing to renounce her faith. In Sudan, a Christian cannot marry a Muslim. Meriam’s mother is Christian and her father is Muslim. She was raised in the Christian faith. Because her father is Muslim, the Sudanese government considers Meriam to be Muslim and therefore will not recognize her marriage to a Christian. 
So is Meriam’s case all about freedom of religion? 
In part. But Meriam’s case is really about being a woman. 
It is fair to say that Meriam was likely arrested and convicted because she is a woman. Both women and men can be charged with apostasy–the failure to denounce one’s faith. But in reality it is overwhelmingly women who are charged with apostasy. There are no known cases of people being executed for apostasy in Sudan since the 1991 Criminal Code was enacted. But people have been charged with apostasy and had their charges dropped or their convictions overturned after recanting their faith. The unequal application of the apostasy law (which, by the way, is illegal under international law), is representative of the unequal power balance between women and men in Sudan. It is a tool used by men to control women who step outside of the patterns of behaviour deemed acceptable for a woman. 
Meriam has taken a stand. By refusing to recant her faith she has publicly taken a stand about who she loves and what she believes. And for this she has been sentenced to death; she is a ‘threat’ to the Sudanese state. What is happening to Meriam is consistent with a broad pattern of women’s human rights abuses in Sudan. Abuses committed to deter women from taking a stand in the public sphere, and for punishing those who do. In Sudan, a woman can be stopped by police, sent before a judge, and sentenced to a public flogging for wearing pants or leaving hair uncovered. Amnesty International has documented cases in Sudan where where women who speak out and protest have been subjected to “forced virginity tests.” 
So who is the woman at the center of this case? Who is Meriam Yehya Ibrahim? 
Meriam is many things. She is a doctor, an accidental activist, a woman, a wife, a mother.  
She is a person going through something that is truly awful. Meriam is imprisoned with two small children, was forced to give birth in shackles, and is being kept alive until her infant is weaned. She is the victim of a society where women and men are most definitely not equal. 
But Meriam married for love and is strong in her faith and isn’t afraid to stand up for who she loves and what she believes, no matter what the cost. She was given four days to recant her faith and save her life and she refused–she remained true to her beliefs. Meriam is someone with strength and conviction who continues to bravely stand up for her rights each and every day in an extremely challenging environment. And by staying true to herself she is making a political statement. She is, whether or not it’s intentional, taking a stand on the rights of women, and the right to freedom of thought, religion, and expression in Sudan. 
Whomever Meriam is to you, she is someone in need of international support and solidarity. We know that the international campaign to raise awareness of her conviction and call for her immediate and unconditional release has garnered attention all around the world.

Canada pledged $2.85 billion from 2010-2015 to reduce maternal and infant mortality in the global South as part of the G8’s Muskoka Initiative. This week, Canada has invited world leaders, the UN, and civil society to Toronto for the “Saving Every Woman Every Child: Within Arm’s Reach” summit on maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) to explore the impact of the Muskoka Initiative and chart the path forward. 
	Back in 2010 when the Muskoka Initiative funding was first announced, Amnesty International, along with other organizations, was critical of the initiative for excluding support and funding for safe abortion services. Amnesty International’s research shows that to reduce maternal mortality rates, women must have access to a full range of sexual and reproductive services. 
This week’s summit provides an opportunity for Canada to re-assess its priorities and look at how any future rounds of funding can work to promote both human rights and health, harmonize Canada’s foreign aid and policy priorities, and truly empower women in the global South. 
A medical-based approach to MNCH leads to medical solutions to infant and child mortality. These can include things such as improved prenatal care and vaccinations. And of course these are good and necessary interventions. 
But focusing on health alone does not address the human rights abuses that place women and children in situations where they may experience poor health. 
We know that poverty and gender-based discrimination are the underlying causes that lead to the high number of preventable deaths and injuries that women and girls experience in pregnancy and childbirth each year. And we know that poverty is at the core of why so many children in the global South die before reaching age five. 
Health-based solutions alone will not change the conditions that lead to the need for these medical interventions. Future programs should be focused on poverty alleviation and ending gender-based discrimination. Anything else is simply putting a Band-Aid on a wound rather than fighting an infection. 
Women, not mothers, should be at the centre of programming in support of MNCH. And these women should be agents of change who determine the very nature of programming and its implementation, not victims in need of “saving” through foreign aid contributions. 
When mothers are at the centre of programming, one looks at how to keep mothers and babies safe. 
When women are at the centre of programming, one looks at how women and girls can be equipped with the information, skills and power to participate in shaping the policies and practices that affect their lives. Placing women at the centre of programming is essential for women to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. 
Future programming must support the rights of women and girls to be able to:	• make decisions about their health;	• ask for and receive information about health services;	• decide whether and when to have children;	• choose whether or not to marry;	• access family planning, contraception, safe and legal abortion and maternal healthcare services; and	• live free from rape and other violence, including forced pregnancy, abortion, sterilization, or marriage. 
MNCH, early and forced marriage, and sexual violence in conflict are three of Canada’s foreign policy priorities. 
Women and girls have the right to live free from rape and other violence, and to decide whether or when to marry. These rights are at the core of Canada’s commitment to end the practice of early and forced marriage and to support the international call to prevent sexual violence in conflict, protect survivors, and prosecute those responsible for committing acts of violence. 
Women and girls, including victims of early and forced marriage, and survivors of sexual violence, also have the right to access a full and comprehensive toolkit of sexual and reproductive health services, including safe and legal abortion. 
The Muskoka Initiative has failed to protect the rights of women and girls to make decisions about what sexual and reproductive health services they wish to access by focusing on mothers and not women, and by excluding funding for safe and legal abortion services. This puts Canada’s commitment to MNCH at odds with its commitment to those who have been forced to marry early and those who have experienced sexual violence. 
When we talk about human rights, there is no halfway. Canada cannot pick and choose which human rights to respect and promote. Women and girls must be able to make decisions about their bodies and their lives, and Canada’s policies and programming should empower women and girls to make these decisions for themselves. 
Respecting, protecting, and promoting the human rights of women and girls. That’s how lives are saved.

You agree, and you get asked your view on paedophilia. You’re asked: “Do you agree that sexual contact between adults and children is always wrong, or do you think it can be justified in some circumstances?” Or let’s say the question is about theft: is it always wrong, or can it be justified in certain contexts?	I think you’d get close to 100 per cent of people saying paedophilia is always wrong, and something approaching that for theft. Ditto plenty of other illegal activities: assault, kidnapping, perjury, whatever. It’s a pretty safe bet that on all those issues there’s going to be an overwhelming consensus that they’re wrong in all circumstances. 
Isn’t it strange, then, that when you ask people about torture – by any definition a horrible crime – you get a lot more equivocation, and even outright tolerance? But that’s what happens, judging by the new Amnesty opinion poll on international attitudes to torture. Here are the headline findings: 
On average, more than a third (36 per cent) of the 21,000 people polled across 21 countries think that “torture is sometimes necessary and acceptable to gain information that may protect the public” 
In China and India a staggering 74 per cent of respondents feel that torture can be justified 
In the UK torture justification is in the “mid-range”, with 29 per cent holding this view, or nearly one in three people 
At the same time, big majorities (ranging from 71-89 per cent) in all 21 countries support the view that “clear rules against torture are needed because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights” 
Now, ponder that last finding for a moment. How is it that large numbers of people can say they find torture immoral, something that should be properly prohibited in law unless human rights are to suffer, yet also say it can be justified for security reasons? Because, according to the data here, that’s precisely what’s happening – a significant number of people are holding both views at once. In China, for instance, 87 per cent say there should be anti-torture laws but almost as many (74 per cent) believe that you can still justify it. 
On the face of it it’s not easy to explain this curious piece of modern doublethink. But I wonder if publics around the world have been (partly) won over by the “security” agenda of their own governments and superpower states. To be sure, governments have a solemn duty to protect their populations from grave threats, and officials would be guilty of serious crimes if they connived in acts of terrorism or turned a blind eye to them. But for years now there’s been relentless talk of “threat levels”, of “plots” and the activities of “extremists”. Our security services have an important job to do but, from James Bond to the Bourne trilogy, Zero Dark 30 to the 24 TV series, there’s been a glamorisation of their role and a clear suggestion that security operatives may in some circumstances be “required” to dispense with the kid gloves (or, non-euphemistically, to torture people). 
However, away from the TV screens, the headline news and the set-piece political news conferences, the grim, everyday reality of torture is often about poor and relatively powerless people being beaten up by unaccountable police officers seemingly intent on meeting crime-detection quotas. So you have women accused of being drug dealers in the Philippines or members of criminal gangs in Mexico; women who will be brutally beaten until they “admit” their crimes. Or you have teenagers in Nigeria who have their fingernails and toe-nails pulled out with pliers until they “confess” to being armed street thieves. And on and on across scores of countries (torture has occurred in 141 countries in the past five years alone). 
Meanwhile, the very “ordinariness” of torture in some countries may explain a further aspect of the Amnesty poll – that nearly half (44 per cent) of respondents said they feared that they personally would be at risk of torture if taken into custody. In some countries this was even higher – in Mexico, for example, it was nearly two-thirds (64 per cent). 
But let’s return to that curious business of justifying torture. Generally this sentiment is lowest in countries with recent histories of mass human rights abuse at the hands of military juntas – in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Greece. Here what might be called the Jack Bauer-isation of people’s outlooks seems to have been the least marked. And that’s quite telling, because when the authorities themselves become the agents of orchestrated human rights abuse, the scales fall from people’s eyes. 
Indeed my reading of this survey is that despite signs that significant minorities have been influenced by a sometimes cynical stoking up of popular fears, an overwhelming majority of people around the world want to see laws against torture and to see them enforced. Deep down they know that torture is abhorrent, a crime every bit as disgusting as paedophilia or kidnapping or assault. And they want to feel safe from it. 
That’s what our new Stop Torture campaign is about.

“I am here to ask for your help,” said Claudia Medina when I met her in Mexico earlier this year. “I’m going to report a crime of torture.” 
Her words touched me, because I knew what Claudia had been through. At 3am on 7 August 2012, marines broke into the home she shared with her husband and three children. They tied her hands and blindfolded her, put her in a pick-up truck and took her to a naval base in Veracruz City. They accused her of being a member of a powerful and violent criminal gang, which she flatly denied. 
 
Claudia later told us how the torturers gave her electric shocks and wrapped her in plastic to stop her bruising when they beat and kicked her. They sexually assaulted her. Then they tied her to a chair and left her outside in the scorching afternoon sun. 
The next day, Claudia was pressured into signing a testimony she had not even read. She was paraded before the media as a dangerous criminal. But later that month, all but one of the charges against her were dropped, and she was released on bail. 
For some Mexican police and military officers, torture is the method of choice for investigating crime. They torture people into signing false statements, and use them as evidence to prosecute. These statements can then be used to suggest that Mexico is fighting crime successfully. 
Claudia was able to tell a judge that she had been tortured, and he ordered an investigation. But those responsible – the Federal Attorney General’s Office – still haven’t followed up. Crucially, they are also preventing Claudia from undergoing a UN-backed medical examination. If this had been carried out immediately after her torture allegations were made, Claudia would have had stronger evidence of the treatment she suffered. 
Almost two years later, Claudia is tired of waiting. “I used to be afraid and thought about not speaking out,” she told me. “But I’m not willing to accept this.” She knows that thousands of people have suffered the same treatment. And she wants to stop it happening to others. 
That’s why Claudia has decided to go public with her story as part of Amnesty’s new, global Stop Torture campaign. 
I know what she is up against, trying to challenge the power of the Mexican armed forces and police. But I also know that she is not alone: We stand with her. 
So I replied that yes, Amnesty, with our more than 3 million supporters, can and will help her and other torture survivors . That’s why we exist. Together, we will pressure governments to give them justice, and stop it happening again. 
Meeting Claudia was a huge source of inspiration and hope for me. It makes me feel strong that a woman who has been tortured still has so much spirit, so much courage and so much conviction. 
And it makes me feel safe in the knowledge that if Claudia can do this, so can we.

On Friday night, Nigerian information minister Labaran Maku went on the radio to denounce evidence obtained by Amnesty International which, we had said, showed the Nigerian security forces received advance warning of the impending Boko Haram attack on Chibok but failed to act on it. Other officials said they doubted “the veracity” of the revelations. The defence ministry described them as “unfortunate and untrue”. 
Later, though, the government softened its position. Musiliu Olatunde Obanikoro, the country’s minister of state for defence, told CNN that “we must investigate and ensure we get to the root of it”. 
As well he might, because we stand by our evidence. 
 
  
Testimonies gathered by Amnesty International, and confirmed and corroborated through multiple credible sources, indicate that several military officers had more than four hours advance warning of the armed raid on Chibok and the subsequent abduction of girls from the Government Girls Secondary School on 14 April. Amnesty International has learned that Nigeria’s military headquarters in Maiduguri was alerted to the impending attack soon after 7pm that day. Between 7 pm and 2 am, the military commands in Damboa and Maiduguri, 36km and 130km away from Chibok respectively, were repeatedly contacted with warnings by both security and local officials. 
As the convoy of armed Boko Haram fighters on motorbikes and trucks made their way towards Chibok they were seen by locals, some of whom also raised the alarm. In the village of Gagilam, local civilian patrols alerted officials, including the Borno State Governor and senior military commanders based in Maiduguri. One local told Amnesty International that he called security officers to warn them. “I made several other calls, including to Maiduguri. I was promised by the security people that reinforcement was on its way,” he said. 
Two senior officers in Nigeria’s military confirmed to Amnesty International that the military was aware of the planned attack even before the calls received from local officials. 
An urgent, independent and transparent investigation is clearly essential. But the first priority for Nigeria’s security forces is to achieve the rescue of the schoolgirls. 
More than three weeks after the incident, the whereabouts of the girls is still unknown. Their ordeal and the strain on their families defies imagination. Frustration and anger at the failure of the government to find them is mounting and these latest revelations will further erode Nigerians’ trust in the ability of its state forces to protect them and uphold the rule of law. 
The Chibok abductions are shocking not just because of the brutality involved, but also because they were preventable. That these young girls were snatched from their school and are still deprived of their liberty is a heinous crime. That the Nigerian authorities had advance warning of the attack and failed to protect the people of Chibok is an inexcusable dereliction of duty. The primary responsibility of any government is to protect its population and the welfare and safety of a nation’s children is paramount. 
The challenge will be to respond in a way that upholds human rights and begins to restore Nigerians’ confidence that the state can protect its people. Since the declaration of a state of emergency in three states more than a year ago, Amnesty International has repeatedly expressed grave concern, not just at the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents but also at the commission of gross violations, including extra-judicial executions, by government security forces engaged in counter-insurgency operations. 
Yesterday, Michelle Obama took the unusual step of delivering her husband’s weekly video address to draw attention to the plight of the kidnapped schoolgirls. “In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters,” she told a national audience on the eve of the US Mother’s Day, adding that she and her husband were “outraged and heartbroken” at the abduction. Some years earlier, speaking in Kenya, President Obama had summed up what many in Nigeria must currently be feeling: “If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists – to protect them and to promote their common welfare – all else is lost.” 
The wellbeing and security of the schoolgirls of Chibok is crucial. President Goodluck Jonathan must now do all in within his power to ensure their safe return. But that is only the start. What Nigeria needs, even when faced with lawless brutality and violence, is a government that respects human rights and the rule of law for all. 
 Please call Chief Ojo Uma Maduekwe, the Nigerian High Commissioner in Canada, to help secure the safe release of the girls.

	A leading United Nations human rights expert says the situation of First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada has reached “crisis proportions in many respects.” 
In a just released report, James Anaya, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, highlights a wide range of concerns documented during his 2013 research mission to Canada. 
 
  
The Special Rapporteur also acknowledges historical patterns of “devastating human rights violations” including the residential school policy, which the Report notes “continues to cast a long shadow of despair on indigenous communities.” 
The report is also critical of the failure to reach timely and just resolution of land disputes, or in many cases to implement agreements and court settlements. 
The report also notes that the federal government “does not appear to have a coherent process or policy in place to address the land and compensation claims of the Métis people.” 
While the report is careful to acknowledge many positive initiatives at all levels of government, the Special Rapporteur also notes that “the relationship between the federal Government and indigenous peoples is strained, perhaps even more so than when the previous Special Rapporteur visited Canada in 2003, despite certain positive developments that have occurred since then and the shared goal of improving conditions for indigenous peoples.” 
  
James Anaya reports that federal officials told him “that the duty to consult and accommodate in connection with resource development projects can be met through existing processes, such as the environmental assessment process.” However, the Rapporteur points out that consultation with Indigenous peoples typically comes late in the process, after  “resource companies have often already invested in exploration and viability studies, baseline studies are no longer possible, and accommodation of indigenous peoples’ concerns requires a deviation from companies’ plans.” 
The Special Rapporteur says that this approach to decision-making leads to “an unnecessarily adversarial framework of opposing interests, rather than facilitating the common creation of mutually beneficial development plans.” 
The Special Rapporteur’s recommendations include: 
In respect to resource development,  the Special Rapporteur recommended that all projects  “should be fully consistent with aboriginal and treaty rights, and should in no case be prejudicial to unsettled claims.” 
The Rapporteur recommended that governments in Canada “should strive to maximize the control of indigenous peoples themselves over extractive operations within their lands and the development of benefits derived therefrom.” 
The Special Rapporteur also recommended “as a general rule resource extraction should not occur on lands subject to aboriginal claims without adequate consultations with and the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned.” 
The Special Rapporteur also released reports from his missions to Panama and Peru.

In a just released report, James Anaya, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, highlights a wide range of concerns documented during his 2013 research mission to Canada. 
,  
  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
The Special Rapporteur also acknowledges historical patterns of “devastating human rights violations” including the residential school policy, which the Report notes “continues to cast a long shadow of despair on indigenous communities.” 
,  
The report is also critical of the failure to reach timely and just resolution of land disputes, or in many cases to implement agreements and court settlements. 
,  
The report also notes that the federal government “does not appear to have a coherent process or policy in place to address the land and compensation claims of the Métis people.” 
,  
While the report is careful to acknowledge many positive initiatives at all levels of government, the Special Rapporteur also notes that “the relationship between the federal Government and indigenous peoples is strained, perhaps even more so than when the previous Special Rapporteur visited Canada in 2003, despite certain positive developments that have occurred since then and the shared goal of improving conditions for indigenous peoples.”

James Anaya reports that federal officials told him “that the duty to consult and accommodate in connection with resource development projects can be met through existing processes, such as the environmental assessment process.” However, the Rapporteur points out that consultation with Indigenous peoples typically comes late in the process, after  “resource companies have often already invested in exploration and viability studies, baseline studies are no longer possible, and accommodation of indigenous peoples’ concerns requires a deviation from companies’ plans.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur says that this approach to decision-making leads to “an unnecessarily adversarial framework of opposing interests, rather than facilitating the common creation of mutually beneficial development plans.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur’s recommendations include: 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
In respect to resource development,  the Special Rapporteur recommended that all projects  “should be fully consistent with aboriginal and treaty rights, and should in no case be prejudicial to unsettled claims.” 
,  
The Rapporteur recommended that governments in Canada “should strive to maximize the control of indigenous peoples themselves over extractive operations within their lands and the development of benefits derived therefrom.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur also recommended “as a general rule resource extraction should not occur on lands subject to aboriginal claims without adequate consultations with and the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur also released reports from his missions to Panama and Peru.

The stories mount, stories of human rights abuse and injustice: ‘mining activists shot’, ‘mine operations suspended’, ‘company accused of water pollution.’ Far too often a Canadian mining company is behind the story.  Canadian mining companies lead the mining world; but none aspire to lead the world in mining-related human rights abuses.

Amnesty International encourages businesses and governments to ensure that company operations – at home and abroad – promote strong human rights protection and do not lead to human rights abuse. Central to that effort, we recently published a new book, Injustice Incorporated: Advancing the Right to Remedy for Corporate Abuses of Human Rights. The book underscores  the  importance of ensuring that individuals or communities who have experienced human rights abuses associated with the operations of a company have access to an effective remedy for the harms they have endured.   
	Access to remedy is a fundamental component to the ‘protect, respect and remedy’ framework laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011 and supported by Canada. Yet, our book demonstrates that access to remedy remains elusive for most people, such as: 	  
	The cases  demonstrate the length of time victims have been trying to seek an effective remedy, with only very limited success. The Omai Gold Mines class action lawsuit, first heard by the Quebec Superior Court, was referred back to Guyana in 1998 and despite two subsequent legal attempts, the full case has never been heard: each times it was dismissed on technical grounds.  
	Injustice Incorporated enumerates six key recommendations that governments should pursue in order to ensure the availability of effective remedies for corporate abuses of human rights. The recommendations encompass both legal reforms and changes to the behaviour of companies and governments. 
 1. Make parent/controlling companies responsible for human rights abuses arising in their global operations. 
					2. Eliminate in home State court the use of the forum non conveniens doctrine in cases concerning extraterritorial corporate-related human rights abuses. 
					3. Develop guidance for judges and prosecutors, preferably in a multilateral forum, with respect to international assistance and cooperation to ensure effective remedy in cases concerning corporate-related human rights abuses. 
					4. Increase access to relevant information concerning corporate-related human rights abuses including by requiring companies to generate and disclose information that is critical for the effective enjoyment of human rights, with regard to their domestic and foreign operations. 
					5. Reform civil procedure laws on disclosure in cases of alleged corporate human rights abuses. 
					6. Reduce corporate influence on the state, including through legislation that requires politicians and civil servant to disclose all meetings with corporate actors, including informal meetings, and the issues discussed. 
	Foremost, companies have a duty to care for the people affected by their operations and should be held responsible for human rights abuses that arise in their global operations. In order to reduce corporate influence on States, legislation is needed requiring politicians and civil servants to disclose all meetings with corporate actors, including informal meetings, and the issues discussed. Similarly, companies need to ensure rights holders have access to information about how company operations will affect them and disclose information critical for the effective enjoyment of their human rights. 
	Legal reforms are also required: the elimination of home State court use of the forum non conveniens doctrine (making it possible to hold parent companies responsible human rights abuses at their overseas projects); guidance to judges and prosecutors with respect to international cooperation to ensure effective remedy in corporate-related human rights abuses; and reform of civil procedures law on disclosure in cases of alleged corporate human rights abuses. 
	The matter is complex.  The need for foreign direct investment leaves some developing countries relatively powerless to push for rights protections in their dealings with foreign companies. And in countries with high foreign debt or restrictive trade agreements, compliance with human rights obligations is even further out of reach. Canada must take steps to ensure that the political power wielded by Canadian companies overseas does not lead to human rights abuses and also does not prevent people from seeking and obtaining effective remedy for the harms they experience. 
	The changes needed in Canada involve a number of different government departments, including International Trade, Foreign Affairs, Industry Canada and Justice. It is a reform process that should be led by the Prime Minister. 
	In our globalized world, we can’t hide behind the idea that the harm is happening somewhere else and is someone else’s problem. Human rights abuses at some Canadian mines are happening now.  Major changes are required to ensure accountability for companies that cause harm and effective remedy for people who have been harmed.  
	Governments bear responsibility for these needed changes. Businesses, including Canadian mining firms, need to get on board. The evidence shows that industry self-policing is simply not enough to prevent harm. By ensuring rights are upheld, accountability processes are predictable and transparent, and legal processes and remedies are clear; and the lives of people living in communities where Canadian mines operate will be improved. It is in the interests of all.

“What we do not need now is to stop and talk and study. We need more action.” – Federal Justice Minister Peter McKay, March 2014. 
,  
Let’s be clear: we all want action to end violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. 
,  
But we don’t need just any action. We need action that can actually stop the violence tearing First Nations, Inuit and Metis women and girls from their families. We need action that is coordinated and properly-resourced. And we need action that is based on accurate information and a clear understanding of the true extent and nature of the threats faced based by Indigenous women and girls. 
,  
Unfortunately, that is not the kind of action that the federal government is delivering. 
,  
After years and years of Indigenous women’s organizations demanding action, the RCMP has just carried out its first systematic attempt to determine the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. A backgrounder just released on the RCMP website states that more than 1000 Indigenous women were murdered in Canada between 1980 and 2012. This represents 16 percent of all women murdered during this time, even though Aboriginal women make up around 4 percent of the population. 
,  
The RCMP numbers are consistent with the findings of the Native Women’s Association of Canada, which has said that violence against Indigenous women and girls is much more prevalent than the 882 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women that it was previously able to independently document. 
,  
Critically, however, the new figures released by the RCMP are almost certainly only part of the picture – the true scale of violence faced by Indigenous women and girls may be much higher than even these numbers suggest. 
,  
The RCMP says its findings are based on collaboration with Statistics Canada and more than 300 different police jurisdictions. However, we already know from Statistics Canada that police often fail to record whether or not the victims of violent crime are Indigenous. In 2009, for example, police recorded the Indigenous identity of the majority of homicide victims as “unknown”. 
,  
Furthermore, because there is no systematic guidance for how police should record Aboriginal identity, Aboriginal victims of crime may be inaccurately recorded as non-Aboriginal. In addition, there are serious, persistent concerns that suspicious deaths of Aboriginal women and girls are all too often explained away as accidents without first being sufficiently investigated. 
,  
More will be known about how the RCMP figures were determined when the RCMP releases its full report later this month. In the meantime, the most pressing question is why RCMP has never tried to gather this information before. 
,  
As the RCMP backgrounder notes, such information is a crucial tool for designing prevention strategies for those at greatest risk. This is why for more than a decade groups like the Native Women’s Association of Canada and Amnesty International have called for consistent, accurate collection and reporting of data on violence against Indigenous women and girls. There is simply no excuse for the failure to do so. 
,  
The bigger issue behind the failure to record and report on this data is that the federal government is simply not listening to the voices of Indigenous women. Government officials keeps referring to $25 million in programs, like funding for a new national missing persons database, that the government says are an adequate and appropriate response to the threats facedby Indigenous women and girls. But the government is not talking about all the calls for action from Indigenous women’s organizations and frontline service providers that have gone ignored. 
,  
This is why Amnesty International supports the growing demands for a national inquiry, long called for by Indigenous women’s organizations, so that these voices can be heard, and there can be greater opportunity to hold government accountable for acting on the solutions identified by affected families and communities and other experts. 
,  
Critically, such an inquiry must be part of a commitment to a national action plan, so that piecemeal programs can be replaced with a comprehensive and coordinated response. 
,  
Every act of violence against women is deplorable. As we have said all along, the vastly disproportionate rate of violence faced by Indigenous women and girls is nothing less than a national human rights tragedy – and the response by government must be in keeping with the scale and severity of this violence. 
,  
Nothing less is acceptable.

On the steps of Parliament, we displayed beautiful, heartfelt photo messages from activists across Canada. Then we went inside to present the government with a box jam-packed with petitions – thousands and thousands of them.

It was two years ago that courageous Colombian Indigenous people sent photo messages to Canada to tell us about deadly assaults on their lives and lands. Those photo messages put a moving human face on an acute yet hidden human rights emergency, one that threatens the physical and cultural survival of more than a third of Indigenous peoples in Colombia amidst violence, forced displacement and the imposition of resource extraction projects.

, 	Members and supporters of Amnesty International responded immediately and generously to appeals from Colombia’s Indigenous movement to raise our voices with them and call for action. Many sent unique, eye-catching photo messages to build a massive digital quilt of concern. 
,  
Today Amnesty Canada’s Secretary General Alex Neve handed over the photo messages to David Anderson, Parliamentary Secretary for Latin America, together with tens of thousands of petition appeals. Our Secretary General was accompanied by Chief Ghislain Picard of the Assembly of First Nations, who shared the deep concerns of Indigenous peoples in Canada.  
,  
At a press conference before the handover, Alex Neve spoke for all our activists when he underscored Canada’s obligations, given the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement which has opened the door for Canadian companies to join a resource extraction boom without human rights guarantees:

“The decision to sign a free trade deal with Colombia, amidst so many trade-related human rights challenges, was a risky one. Adding a requirement to assess human rights impacts was supposed to address that concern. The meaningless human rights reporting to date has now become part of the problem, instead of a means to identify any human rights issues and then address them. The 2014 report gives the Canadian government an important chance to show it is serious about human rights, particularly the rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia who face such a perilous future.  
,  
Canada has an opportunity and an obligation to acknowledge the human rights emergency for Indigenous Peoples in Colombia, to ensure their rights are respected, particularly in areas of resource extraction, and to hold Canadian companies accountable for their human rights record in Colombia.”

Thank you to everyone who has participated in this campaign and raised your voices to protect the rights and survival of Indigenous peoples in Colombia.

Today is the one-year anniversary of the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory building in Bangladesh, which left more than 1,100 workers dead and many more injured.  The disaster has become the most shocking recent example of business-related human rights abuse, and the images of dead workers in the debris of the collapsed factory have become powerful symbols of the pursuit of profit at the expense of people. 
,  
The Rana Plaza building housed numerous garment factories supplying international clothing companies. Over the past year, there have been various initiatives to provide compensation to the victims, involving government, global brands, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). However, these efforts have so far proved insufficient, and survivors continue to suffer and struggle to support themselves and their families.  
,  
One of the most shocking claims that has subsequently come to light is that workers did not want to enter the building because of safety concerns – cracks had been seen in the walls the day before and the building had been shut down. Despite this, managers ordered workers to enter the building. 
,  
Naturally, there has been much debate on the causes of the disaster, who was responsible, and how such a catastrophe could be avoided in future. Discussion has focused on the nature of global supply chains, workers’ rights and safety standards, and the huge market for cheap fashion in the West. 
,  
But one particular systemic issue has been too neglected: corporate power and the relationship between business and government. 
,  
This is a topic extensively discussed in Amnesty International’s recently published book “Injustice Incorporated: Corporate Abuse and the Human Right to Remedy”, and is hugely relevant when trying to understand why 1,100 garment workers needlessly lost their lives a year ago. 
,  
The high degree of political influence by the garment industry in Bangladesh is apparent. Transparency International estimates that 10% of the country’s members of parliament are directly involved in the sector, including members of key committees.  A recent report by New York University highlighted how the garment industry’s close relationship with government is a primary reason for why labour laws are so badly enforced in Bangladesh.  
,  
Amnesty International’s own research has highlighted the pervasive problem of undue corporate influence on governments. The private sector is of course entitled to engage with governments, and can legitimately influence State policy; however, all too often business interests and profits are prioritised over human rights and can prevent victims from obtaining justice. 
,  
This is of course not limited to Bangladesh – two other cases Amnesty International has campaigned on clearly illustrate the problem of undue business influence on States. 
,  
This year also marks a significant anniversary of another major industrial disaster: it is almost 30 years since the deadly gas leak from a former Union Carbide chemical factory in Bhopal, India, that has killed more than 20,000 people left more than 500,000 survivors suffering long-term injury and disability. In 2007, it was revealed that Dow Chemical, the US company that bought Union Carbide, had sought to interfere with judicial processes through extensive high-level lobbying of the Indian Government.  The company had used the promise of future investment in India to try to persuade the Government to intervene and halt ongoing legal actions against the company concerning the Bhopal legacy.  
,  
Multinational corporations can also influence the governments of countries where they are headquartered. Documents recently obtained through Freedom of Information requests have shown that the UK government was heavily lobbied by two companies, Shell and Rio Tinto, in relation to two high-profile US human rights court cases. The UK government subsequently intervened in both cases in support of the companies’ position: effectively backing the interests of UK business in avoiding liability for human rights abuses over the right of victims to seek justice. 
,  
Corporate involvement in policy-making must be transparent and legitimate, and business influence must not be allowed to grow to the point that victims are powerless to claim their rights to effective remedy. Two ways of achieving this are to greatly improve disclosure of corporate lobbying efforts and to require that State efforts to shape foreign economic and investment policies are subject to a test of their potential impacts on human rights. 
,  
As long as business continues to have a disproportionate influence on States, another Rana Plaza is not far away. Governments will be far less likely to enforce laws or preventative measures that will protect workers from human rights abuses, and, like in Bangladesh, those who have suffered the worst will be left without justice and compensation.

Their crime? Sending out tweets during the first few days of the Gezi Park protests last June. If found guilty, they could face up to 3 years in prison. 
During the protests that began in Istanbul’s Gezi Park and Taksim Square and quickly spread around the country in June 2013, social media played a central role, allowing protestors to share information on where police were breaking up the protests or to request medical support or information on individuals whose whereabouts were unclear. With the mainstream media failing to report the events, social media platforms also allowed the public to find out what was going on in the streets. 
The authorities and chiefly the Prime Minister responded by attacking the use of Twitter and other social media. The day after the Prime Minister famously called Twitter a ‘menace’, arrests were carried out in the western city of Izmir for tweeting about the protests. The PM is himself listed as a “victim” in the case. In the last month, both Twitter and YouTube have been blocked in Turkey. While the ban on Twitter has been lifted, the authorities continue to threaten its closure. 
Following the arrests, in February, the trial of 29 young men and women began at a court in Izmir. The majority of the people on trial are students, aged between 19 and 36 They stand accused of ‘inciting the public to break the law’ for tweets they had sent supporting the protests, reporting police violence, or calling for medical aid. Some are accused of insulting the Prime Minister. 
It is truly bizarre that 29 individuals should be brought to a court to defend their few handpicked tweets. None of the tweets contain incitement to or evidence of participation in violence’ or anything else that could be called criminal. They are simply sharing information and opinions – and it is their right to do so. In short, this case should never have been brought. 
I will be tweeting the developments from the courtroom on Monday. 
Show your solidarity with them through the much reviled Twitter!

, 	Director of Global Issues, Amnesty International 
,  
For more than five years now Amnesty International has been working on a project on the right to effective remedy in cases of corporate-related human rights abuses.  We have focused on cases where poor communities have confronted powerful multinational companies (MNCs) in an effort to seek justice. The project has included wide-ranging research as well as support to strategic litigation in several countries. Last month (March) we published a book, Injustice Incorporated, based on our research and practical legal work. The book highlights several obstacles to access to justice – one of which is the political power of MNCs, and the structures that underpin this power. These structures include the role of international financial institutions (IFIs) in laying the foundations for undue corporate influence on the governments and regulators in developing countries. 
,  
The decision to examine the political influence of MNCs was based on our review of four emblematic cases; we initially began looking at the legal challenges that victims faced in these case, but repeatedly found ourselves confronting the way companies exercised political power to the detriment of the right to remedy. The cases we examined in depth during the research were: 
,  
• The 1984 Bhopal gas leak in India, which resulted in the deaths of more than 20,000 people. More than 570,000 people, many of whom are still suffering, were exposed to damaging levels of toxic gas. Ongoing environmental pollution resulting from prior operations at the old plant site continues to pose serious risks to the health of surrounding communities. 
,  
• The case of Omai gold in Guyana, where a waste containment system failed in August 1995, flooding a river with hazardous material and causing serious harm to local livelihoods. The contamination has never been properly cleaned up. 
,  
• The Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, which also involved the failure of a mine waste containment system and the flooding of local rivers with harmful waste. The initial event occurred in 1984. No clean-up has ever taken place and the law was changed to legitimize ongoing pollution of the river system, which continues to this day, despite the damage to the environment and the risks to human health. 
,  
• The dumping of toxic waste in Côte d’Ivoire in 2006, which resulted in more than 100,000 people seeking medical treatment. The waste originated in Europe, was unlawfully transported to Abidjan and dumped in 18 locations around the city. The long-term health impacts of the dumping are unclear and the decontamination process remains incomplete. 
,  
In the first three cases, the abuses originated between two and three decades ago, and in the case of Bhopal, the impact has been inter-generational. The reason these cases were chosen was in part because of the length of time victims have been trying to seek an effective remedy, with only very limited success. As no effective remedy has been provided, the abuses are ongoing. The failures cannot be relegated to the past – the efforts to achieve remedy continue today. In addition to these four cases we also drew on many other cases on which Amnesty International has worked over the last decade. 
, 	  
,  
,  
States have a duty under international human rights law to ensure that companies do not have a negative impact on human rights, and to provide mechanisms of redress when rights are infringed. The autonomy and capacity of governments to discharge these legal responsibilities is therefore of paramount importance. However, our research found that many governments confront a range of direct and indirect pressures and constraints associated with the mechanics and structures of contemporary international political economy that limit their capacity to discharge these responsibilities. 
,  
We found that corporate influence on the right to remedy often began at a very early stage in the investment process – when companies influenced, behind the scenes, the laws and regulations that would govern their investments in developing economies. In some cases companies directly shaped the laws; in other cases we found that the influence of home state governments, directly or via IFIs, promoted laws and frameworks in developing economies which fundamentally undermined human rights, including the right to remedy.  Amongst the most egregious examples we documented were laws in Papua New Guinea  and Guyana the legitimised damage to the environment on which thousands of people relied for food and livelihoods; as the company’s harmful actions were deemed legal, the affected communities’ ability to seek a remedy was undercut form the outset. 
, 	  
,  
,  
Although corporate influence is well-recognised, there has been relatively little analysis of the mechanics and impacts of this phenomenon. On one level the basis of power of MNCs is obvious – companies derive power from the fact they help create wealth, jobs, goods, services and revenues. These are things most countries in the world want and need. For many businesses – particularly small and medium enterprises – their power is relatively limited. But MNCs often have significant power and influence. This is more pronounced in certain contexts – when the company is dealing with a relatively poor State that needs foreign investment or needs the company’s expertise to leverage national resource wealth, as in the case of extractive industries. It is further enhanced when a country is indebted. The majority of developing-country debt is owed in foreign currency such as US dollars. To repay this debt, developing countries need to promote growth in export sectors that generate income in hard currency. 
,  
The need for foreign direct investment (FDI) can leave developing countries relatively powerless in their dealings with corporate interests. However, the power imbalance is not due merely to one party’s relatively greater need for the other. The structural sources of corporate power are multi-layered and interconnect with the economic and political interests of both the home and host States. 
, 	  
,  
,  
International financial institutions (IFIs) such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have played a key role in promoting investor-friendly regulatory environments in many countries, particularly developing countries. During the 1980s and 1990s, as part of structural adjustment programs, many countries were put under considerable pressure by IFIs to reform their legal frameworks to encourage foreign investment. This phenomenon has re-emerged in some ways as IFIs work with countries affected by the financial and economic crises that emerged in 2008. 
,  
IFIs have promoted rules that reduce bureaucratic processes and strengthen the protection of corporate property and rights; this enabled companies to invest in developing countries with a higher level of security about their investment. IFIs have also promoted measures that go beyond guaranteeing the security of investments and actually enhance the potential for investors to secure – and export – profits.   IFIs prescriptions to attract foreign investment have included reducing or removing regulations that protect the environment and human rights. This has been particularly notable in the context of the extractive sector where we have seen mining and forestry codes relaxed, the removal of bans on raw log exports, liberalization of land ownership rules and the introduction of legislation granting companies exemptions from existing laws and guaranteeing indemnity from environmental damage. 
,  
The capacity of IFIs to press such policy frameworks on host governments has been particularly pronounced in those countries encumbered with significant foreign debt burdens. For example, the IMF has encouraged countries to prioritize export sectors because boosting exports enables countries to raise the capital needed to pay back loans from the IMF and other lenders. Such export-oriented development strategies have often been pursued with particular fervour in mining, oil, gas and logging. IFIs have effectively pushed many developing countries into a greater dependence on foreign companies that invest in just a few sectors. In the cases of Ok Tedi and Omai, this very circumstance of the country’s high dependence on a few major corporate investors created a significant power imbalance that companies could exploit. In effect, IFIs – particularly in the 1980s and 90s – laid the foundations for abusive corporate practices in developing countries, and many of the policies they promoted remain in place today. 
,  
In addition to promoting investor-friendly rules and a reduction in the scope of environmental and social protections, IFIs have promoted – and at times required – cuts in public expenditure as part of structural adjustment programmes. Therefore, at the same time that regulatory regimes were relaxed to attract foreign investment, funding was often reduced for vital government functions to monitor and control any adverse social, environmental and human rights consequences associated with corporate operations. The outcome: less regulation and then less capacity to enforce what is left of it. 
,  
The Ok Tedi mine illustrates the support an individual project can enjoy from the investor friendly environment encouraged by IFIs. Since the early 1960s, various IFIs (in particular, the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank) have encouraged a range of institutional and policy changes to attract foreign investors into the mining and petroleum sectors of Papua New Guinea. During the 1990s, the IFIs moved forward with a structural adjustment programme for the country which included US$10 million for an institutional strengthening project in the mining sector. This project was primarily intended to strengthen the capacity of national government agencies to attract new foreign investment. At the same time Papua New Guinea was expected to reduce government spending and the size of the civil service. This resulted in the Department of Environment and Conservation being dismantled, which affected the government’s ability to regulate mining and forestry projects. In 2009 Amnesty International asked Papua New Guinea’s [then] Health Minister, Sasa Zibe, about the adequacy of environmental and health protection in the context of mine operations in the country. The minister emphasized the serious constraints confronting the government, which he said was “facing pressing economic problems to meet debt needs.” 
,  
Guyana’s willingness to shape policy frameworks in line with foreign investor interests was similarly affected by the conditions of loans from IFIs and the need for FDI. The mining, oil and logging sectors were targeted as part of the export-oriented strategy promoted to help Guyana meet its foreign debt repayments. As part of a structural adjustment programme that began in the late 1980s, the IMF sought to make these industries the country’s key economic sectors. During the 1990s, the government opened up exploitation of the country’s natural resources, especially timber and minerals, in order to generate income and satisfy the conditions of a 1991 IMF/World Bank structural adjustment programme. 
,  
The Omai project was a direct result of the policies encouraged by the IFIs, and one of the centrepieces of the World Bank’s structural adjustment programme for Guyana. The World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was a key financier for the project. There are several accounts of direct political pressure exercised by MIGA to prevent tightening of environmental regulations following the waste spill, including reports that a MIGA representative told parliamentarians that any new environmental regulations placed on the Omai would be tantamount to nationalisation. 
,  
More recent IFI policy – particularly that of the World Bank – has incorporated some recognition of the need for a sustainable development approach in projects in the natural resource sectors. However, a 2004 study of mineral development in Papua New Guinea found that the IFIs remained far more strongly focused on building systems and institutions to enable and facilitate FDI than on building regulatory capacity to manage the impacts of FDI projects. Such concerns remain largely unaddressed by IFIs.  In the past year concerns have been expressed about the influence of IFIs on the frameworks for private-sector engagement in export industries in a number of countries, including Myanmar and Burundi. 
,  
While IFIs have been a significant source of corporate power, they are not the only source. The way in which IFIs help to create a strong foundation for corporate influence intersects with a number of other features of contemporary political economy. Over the past 15 years we have seen the expansion of law to protect global economic interests, through a wide range of international investment and trade agreements backed by enforcement mechanisms. But while economic interests have been able to make the law work for them, those most affected by their operations have often seen the law and protection of the law recede in the face of corporate power.

For more than five years now Amnesty International has been working on a project on the right to effective remedy in cases of corporate-related human rights abuses.  We have focused on cases where poor communities have confronted powerful multinational companies (MNCs) in an effort to seek justice. The project has included wide-ranging research as well as support to strategic litigation in several countries. Last month (March) we published a book, Injustice Incorporated, based on our research and practical legal work. The book highlights several obstacles to access to justice – one of which is the political power of MNCs, and the structures that underpin this power. These structures include the role of international financial institutions (IFIs) in laying the foundations for undue corporate influence on the governments and regulators in developing countries. 
 
The decision to examine the political influence of MNCs was based on our review of four emblematic cases; we initially began looking at the legal challenges that victims faced in these case, but repeatedly found ourselves confronting the way companies exercised political power to the detriment of the right to remedy. The cases we examined in depth during the research were: 
• The 1984 Bhopal gas leak in India, which resulted in the deaths of more than 20,000 people. More than 570,000 people, many of whom are still suffering, were exposed to damaging levels of toxic gas. Ongoing environmental pollution resulting from prior operations at the old plant site continues to pose serious risks to the health of surrounding communities. 
• The case of Omai gold in Guyana, where a waste containment system failed in August 1995, flooding a river with hazardous material and causing serious harm to local livelihoods. The contamination has never been properly cleaned up. 
• The Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, which also involved the failure of a mine waste containment system and the flooding of local rivers with harmful waste. The initial event occurred in 1984. No clean-up has ever taken place and the law was changed to legitimize ongoing pollution of the river system, which continues to this day, despite the damage to the environment and the risks to human health. 
• The dumping of toxic waste in Côte d’Ivoire in 2006, which resulted in more than 100,000 people seeking medical treatment. The waste originated in Europe, was unlawfully transported to Abidjan and dumped in 18 locations around the city. The long-term health impacts of the dumping are unclear and the decontamination process remains incomplete. 
In the first three cases, the abuses originated between two and three decades ago, and in the case of Bhopal, the impact has been inter-generational. The reason these cases were chosen was in part because of the length of time victims have been trying to seek an effective remedy, with only very limited success. As no effective remedy has been provided, the abuses are ongoing. The failures cannot be relegated to the past – the efforts to achieve remedy continue today. In addition to these four cases we also drew on many other cases on which Amnesty International has worked over the last decade.	  
States have a duty under international human rights law to ensure that companies do not have a negative impact on human rights, and to provide mechanisms of redress when rights are infringed. The autonomy and capacity of governments to discharge these legal responsibilities is therefore of paramount importance. However, our research found that many governments confront a range of direct and indirect pressures and constraints associated with the mechanics and structures of contemporary international political economy that limit their capacity to discharge these responsibilities. 
We found that corporate influence on the right to remedy often began at a very early stage in the investment process – when companies influenced, behind the scenes, the laws and regulations that would govern their investments in developing economies. In some cases companies directly shaped the laws; in other cases we found that the influence of home state governments, directly or via IFIs, promoted laws and frameworks in developing economies which fundamentally undermined human rights, including the right to remedy.  Amongst the most egregious examples we documented were laws in Papua New Guinea  and Guyana the legitimised damage to the environment on which thousands of people relied for food and livelihoods; as the company’s harmful actions were deemed legal, the affected communities’ ability to seek a remedy was undercut form the outset.	  
Although corporate influence is well-recognised, there has been relatively little analysis of the mechanics and impacts of this phenomenon. On one level the basis of power of MNCs is obvious – companies derive power from the fact they help create wealth, jobs, goods, services and revenues. These are things most countries in the world want and need. For many businesses – particularly small and medium enterprises – their power is relatively limited. But MNCs often have significant power and influence. This is more pronounced in certain contexts – when the company is dealing with a relatively poor State that needs foreign investment or needs the company’s expertise to leverage national resource wealth, as in the case of extractive industries. It is further enhanced when a country is indebted. The majority of developing-country debt is owed in foreign currency such as US dollars. To repay this debt, developing countries need to promote growth in export sectors that generate income in hard currency. 
The need for foreign direct investment (FDI) can leave developing countries relatively powerless in their dealings with corporate interests. However, the power imbalance is not due merely to one party’s relatively greater need for the other. The structural sources of corporate power are multi-layered and interconnect with the economic and political interests of both the home and host States.	  
International financial institutions (IFIs) such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have played a key role in promoting investor-friendly regulatory environments in many countries, particularly developing countries. During the 1980s and 1990s, as part of structural adjustment programs, many countries were put under considerable pressure by IFIs to reform their legal frameworks to encourage foreign investment. This phenomenon has re-emerged in some ways as IFIs work with countries affected by the financial and economic crises that emerged in 2008. 
IFIs have promoted rules that reduce bureaucratic processes and strengthen the protection of corporate property and rights; this enabled companies to invest in developing countries with a higher level of security about their investment. IFIs have also promoted measures that go beyond guaranteeing the security of investments and actually enhance the potential for investors to secure – and export – profits.   IFIs prescriptions to attract foreign investment have included reducing or removing regulations that protect the environment and human rights. This has been particularly notable in the context of the extractive sector where we have seen mining and forestry codes relaxed, the removal of bans on raw log exports, liberalization of land ownership rules and the introduction of legislation granting companies exemptions from existing laws and guaranteeing indemnity from environmental damage. 
The capacity of IFIs to press such policy frameworks on host governments has been particularly pronounced in those countries encumbered with significant foreign debt burdens. For example, the IMF has encouraged countries to prioritize export sectors because boosting exports enables countries to raise the capital needed to pay back loans from the IMF and other lenders. Such export-oriented development strategies have often been pursued with particular fervour in mining, oil, gas and logging. IFIs have effectively pushed many developing countries into a greater dependence on foreign companies that invest in just a few sectors. In the cases of Ok Tedi and Omai, this very circumstance of the country’s high dependence on a few major corporate investors created a significant power imbalance that companies could exploit. In effect, IFIs – particularly in the 1980s and 90s – laid the foundations for abusive corporate practices in developing countries, and many of the policies they promoted remain in place today. 
In addition to promoting investor-friendly rules and a reduction in the scope of environmental and social protections, IFIs have promoted – and at times required – cuts in public expenditure as part of structural adjustment programmes. Therefore, at the same time that regulatory regimes were relaxed to attract foreign investment, funding was often reduced for vital government functions to monitor and control any adverse social, environmental and human rights consequences associated with corporate operations. The outcome: less regulation and then less capacity to enforce what is left of it. 
The Ok Tedi mine illustrates the support an individual project can enjoy from the investor friendly environment encouraged by IFIs. Since the early 1960s, various IFIs (in particular, the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank) have encouraged a range of institutional and policy changes to attract foreign investors into the mining and petroleum sectors of Papua New Guinea. During the 1990s, the IFIs moved forward with a structural adjustment programme for the country which included US$10 million for an institutional strengthening project in the mining sector. This project was primarily intended to strengthen the capacity of national government agencies to attract new foreign investment. At the same time Papua New Guinea was expected to reduce government spending and the size of the civil service. This resulted in the Department of Environment and Conservation being dismantled, which affected the government’s ability to regulate mining and forestry projects. In 2009 Amnesty International asked Papua New Guinea’s [then] Health Minister, Sasa Zibe, about the adequacy of environmental and health protection in the context of mine operations in the country. The minister emphasized the serious constraints confronting the government, which he said was “facing pressing economic problems to meet debt needs.” 
Guyana’s willingness to shape policy frameworks in line with foreign investor interests was similarly affected by the conditions of loans from IFIs and the need for FDI. The mining, oil and logging sectors were targeted as part of the export-oriented strategy promoted to help Guyana meet its foreign debt repayments. As part of a structural adjustment programme that began in the late 1980s, the IMF sought to make these industries the country’s key economic sectors. During the 1990s, the government opened up exploitation of the country’s natural resources, especially timber and minerals, in order to generate income and satisfy the conditions of a 1991 IMF/World Bank structural adjustment programme. 
The Omai project was a direct result of the policies encouraged by the IFIs, and one of the centrepieces of the World Bank’s structural adjustment programme for Guyana. The World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was a key financier for the project. There are several accounts of direct political pressure exercised by MIGA to prevent tightening of environmental regulations following the waste spill, including reports that a MIGA representative told parliamentarians that any new environmental regulations placed on the Omai would be tantamount to nationalisation. 
More recent IFI policy – particularly that of the World Bank – has incorporated some recognition of the need for a sustainable development approach in projects in the natural resource sectors. However, a 2004 study of mineral development in Papua New Guinea found that the IFIs remained far more strongly focused on building systems and institutions to enable and facilitate FDI than on building regulatory capacity to manage the impacts of FDI projects. Such concerns remain largely unaddressed by IFIs.  In the past year concerns have been expressed about the influence of IFIs on the frameworks for private-sector engagement in export industries in a number of countries, including Myanmar and Burundi. 
While IFIs have been a significant source of corporate power, they are not the only source. The way in which IFIs help to create a strong foundation for corporate influence intersects with a number of other features of contemporary political economy. Over the past 15 years we have seen the expansion of law to protect global economic interests, through a wide range of international investment and trade agreements backed by enforcement mechanisms. But while economic interests have been able to make the law work for them, those most affected by their operations have often seen the law and protection of the law recede in the face of corporate power. Deregulation, the need to attract foreign investment, and provisions in trade and investment agreements have all squeezed the protection the law can provide people affected by corporate operations – particularly in developing countries. 
This reality – which has allowed companies to exert undue influence on the very laws and structures that should regulate them and protect people and the environment – has yet to be properly recognised in the debates around business and human rights.  However, until the sources and impacts of corporate political power are addressed, efforts to fine-tune legal systems will likely have little impact.

“Our health, our bodies, our rights, our future—in your hands now” is the message that Amnesty International sent to United Nations Secretary-General Ban-Ki-Moon during a handover of 281,102 petition signatures in New York today. 
,  
I like to think that my body and my health are in my own hands, thank you very much. My grandmother and my mother fought hard to make sure that I could grow up in a world where I can receive information about family planning, where getting married is a choice, and where I am in control about making decisions about my sexuality and reproduction. 
,  
But much as I like to think that I am the sole master of my destiny, I have spent enough time in the halls of the United Nations to know better. This week, governments from around the world have come together at the United Nations in New York at the 47th Session of the Commission on Population and Development. Throughout this week they will talk about big global issues like young people’s access to comprehensive sexuality education, and the many ways and forms in which people create families. They will leave New York with agreement on a document that will re-affirm the rights that we have to make decisions about our sexuality and reproduction. And that is no small thing. 
,  
Twenty years ago world leaders met at the Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and for the first time ever agreed that sexual and reproductive rights are human rights. That may have been revolutionary back in 1994, but it’s something we take for granted now. We challenge world leaders this week to be equally revolutionary and adopt an agreement that will set the tone for the next 20 years and move us forward globally in making sure that everyone has the right to freely make some of the most important decisions of their lives. 
,  
The lived reality of people around the world is sometimes forgotten in the airless meeting rooms at the United Nations where men (there are many women in the room but we are far from gender parity) in dark suits sit negotiating our future. It is important for us to inject some life into these meetings and remind governments of who we are and what we are calling for. The petition signatures that so many Canadians collected over the past year, and the photos that activists took on International Women’s Day this year, have been handed over to the United Nations Secretary-General, and presented to officials at the meeting to show them our names, our faces, and our stories, and remind them on whose behalf they are negotiating this week.

Ontario Minister of Natural Resources David Orazietti has announced that – for at least one year – the province will not license new logging on the traditional territory of the Grassy Narrows First Nation in northwestern Ontario.

The province’s latest forest management plan, adopted in December 2013, calls for renewed clear cut logging in the territory.

Sadly, this is not the first time that Eskinder has been jailed for his activism. 
Eskinder and his wife, Serkalem, a newspaper publisher, were previously jailed for speaking out against the government in 2005 and released in 2007 after continued campaigning by Amnesty International. 
  
 
But here is what my strategy is not: a crafty debasement of expectation at the outset, so that by the end the balance of sympathy could sway no way but in my favor. I simply hanker honesty. 
Indeed, I too yearn to be a hero in my son’s eye. Somehow privy to the notion that a male child’s first hero is the father, I dream to play the role. That this phase of the child is posed to pass quickly matters not an iota to me. I insist on my 15 minutes of fame. But I am also interested in the most enduring kind of appraisal, that of respect. While the former, unexplored adoration, is innate in every child, the latter, empathy and regard of the person, is the result of a complex process. And it has to be earned. Whether I merit this honor should be clear by the end of this letter. 
I have reluctantly become an absent father because I ache for what the French in the late 18th century expressed in three simple words: liberté, egalité, fraternité. Before the advent of my son in my life, I was a nonchalant prisoner of conscience on at least seven occasions. The blithe was hardly unnoticed by my incarcerators. 
It troubled them greatly because they did not know how to defeat it. Tyranny is a function of fear: the terror of state violence, the menace of imprisonment, the dread of imposed penury. None of these, however, could be applied against an entire population. But strike only against a handful and copious number of peoples are hypnotized into inaction. Our collective dignity, as the world’s oldest black nation, demands that this spell be broken irrevocably. 
No myth has had wider resonance than the supposed gulf in history, lifestyle, psychology and hence politics between nations. Indeed the measure of progress has trended at varying pace for disparate peoples. But between antiquity and the 16th century, when the first flicker of scientific revolution appeared with the works of Copernicus in astronomy, the rift between the most advanced and the primal was inconsequential. It took two more centuries, until the invention of the steam engine in 1789 in Britain, before science commenced to transform society. Up to this time, the structural gap between Europe, the most advanced, and Africa, perhaps the least developed, was no more dramatic than the cleavage between rural and urban Europe itself. Only in the last 100-150 years was there a recognizable paradigm shift, with rural Europe finally overtaken by the rise of cities. 
No country save the British, with their Magna Carta in 1215 and bill of rights in 1689, could claim centuries old evolution of democratic institutions. The rest of the world plunged haphazardly and unceremoniously into an unexplored world of democratic reconfiguration. The trail blazer, revolutionary France, in 1789, did not seek space for evolution to abscond from the bosom of one of Europe’s most strident monarchy to the enduringly seminal rights of men men and citizen; which enshrined not merely for France but for all humanity the principle of a government constrained by law. No less significantly France and many parts of Western Europe were democratic well before a sizable middle class emerged. The same holds for Britain. The U.S., too, was not only securely democratic in the early 19th century, but was also a nation with an overwhelmingly rural citizenry. 
But fast forward to the mid-20th century and democratic countries were still far from the norm. It took a world war between 1939 and 1945 for democracy to reverse catastrophic slide and settle for an uneasy parity with ascending totalitarianism in Europe. An additional four-decades long cold war, spanning 1945 to 1990, was needed to decide the winner convincingly. Only then did democracy attain momentum. 
Despite the popular convention mischievously amplified by most autocrats, to deter demands for rights, no people or country could plausibly claim an extended tradition of democracy. Unless, that is, the last 200 years of humanity’s 5,000 years of communal history is deemed as elongated. 
And it seems Africa has finally moved to aptly realign with history. The tempo is to boldly march the French way. The result is breathtaking. Over two decades, the period between the collapse of Communisim, in 1989, to the end of the first decade of the new millennium, Africa was transfigured from a repository of fatuous dictators to a stronghold of more democracies than Asia, the continent with the fastest growing middle class in history. How Ethiopia lagged in this transformative saga of African renaissance and reformation accounts for my imprisonment, cruelly and yet impersonally imperiling my prized duty as a father. 
My parents brief matrimony was an early causalty of the intractable tension between tradition and modernity in post-liberation Ethiopia. Gruesome though the Italian occupation was, in the late 1930s, it tore down a smug culture of complacency. The need to modernize, to embrace the know-how of the outside world, was no more in doubt. The ease with which the nation had fallen to fascist Italy was proof beyond reproach. That my parents, both hailing from profoundly conservative Orthodox families, who traditionally equated modern education with Catholicism, were allowed to attend school is testimony of how deep feelings run. 
Modern Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, idealizes, by way of his still ongoing great marriage debate, the kind of union my parents forged. Highly intelligent, both had won super-competitive scholarships to do tertiary studies in American universities. Father was in New Jersey at Rutgers University for six years. Mother’s tenure at the American University of Beirut, the jewel of higher education in the Middle East, was shorter, having pursued post-graduate studies for a year. Both returned home full of energy, with [a] plethora of bright ideas, and a healthy dose of the sanguine optimism of the inexperienced. 
Like many of htier contemporaries, their rise was swift, easy and assimilated in style. Both were successful, upwardly mobile, and still hungry for more when they met. The only predicament was in how they personally embraced modernity, an allegory of the dilemma at the national level.	To his credit father did not yield to the sentiment which Lee Kuan Yew ruefully laments about: the compulsion of educated young men to marry down. In mother he met a remarkably rare Ethiopian woman: financially independent, educated, emotionally secure as a single woman, and no less ambitious than himself. But unlike many of his peers he did not dive for cover. He was in fact a persistent pursuer, her repeated protestation notwithstanding. She was not particularly wary of him, rather she was circumspect of her odds in a primeval society. But in the end, I presume, his charm, and certainly family pressure, inexorably prevailed. A lavish wedding sealed the pact. 
Unlike virtually all the women of her generation, education had emancipated mother not only financially, but crucially, emotionally. Reversal of either was unsavory, to be fended off at any cost. She was in a sense a feminist, absent the creed. There was little of the past she cared for. To exemplify her feelings, she started smoking, though discretely. Had he known, her devoutly religious father would have simply died of grief. Neither, as far as I could discern, did father. He would have certainly balked at the prospect of a smoking wife. Even if he had wanted to oblige her, society, his friends and kin would have censured him. But every puff was an exhilarating expression of freedom for her. Freedom not from want, but the strictures imposed by tradition. When she finally stopped, after her divorce, it was for my sake. I was trying to emulate the only parent I knew. And by this time she also had a more serious diversion to engage her energy; the quest, unprecedented in Ethiopia, to prove that there can be a better life for a single woman after a divorce. Her vindication came, in little over five years, by way of the most successful clinic in the country, which she owned and managed. Father, awed and embarrassed, could only watch from the sidelines. A rebellious wife customarily returned to her husband chastened and humbled. 
	To all appearances, father was the quintessential modern man. He was moderately liberal, he lived in the right neighborhood, he dressed fashionably, his English was faultless, and until the rise of communism drove the latest cars. And he had money. But this was only the façade. His acquiescence to modernity extended only slightly beyond these parameters. The nucleus of the values he internalized from society, which were in need of metamorphosis to complement his public image, remained intact. 
In this sense his profiles outlines the paradox that is the modern Ethiopian intellectual. There is the fixation with the façade of modernity—the technology, the infrastructure, the economy, the lifestyl. But there is also the corresponding resistance to its essential modus operandi—a radically transformed worldview. This means redefined relationships between husband and wife; parents and children; individual and society; the state and its citizens. 
To mother, on the other hand, most established values were anachronistic. She had no compunction discarding them. In their place, a singular fixation with independence took hold. Society was, of course, less than ready to accommodate her. Though unexpressed, her husband had expected blunting of the fiery spirit, a gradual but inevitable acceptance of a place in life as a stay-at-home-mom. She thought otherwise. Forsaking a secure and well-paying job, when females with jobs were a rarity, for a precarious entrepreneurial venture was inexplicable. Both departures from convention were broadly misread as expressions of aggressive disposition. Few were able to see an indomitable spirit of individualism that make a modern society possible. This discord between a cumbersome past and a future grappling to unfold is also at the core of our national dispute over democracy. 
A coarse encounter between the novel and the archaic is as old as history itself. The anecdotal evidence is rarely for the new to relinquish to the old. After all, women no[w] live in a far more liberate milieu than the yesteryears when few brave souls like mother were challenging convention.	Our modern politics has its genesis in a coup attempt in 1960. Though overwhelmed with relative ease, it left a lasting imprint on history by precipitating the rise of a fiery student movement, a precursor to the nation’s major political parties. Inspired by Egypt’s much romanticized coup, in 1952, which propelled young left-leaning revolutionary officers to power, Ethiopia’s was the first shot by soldiers to seize state power in black Africa. But while Egypt’s was conscientiously planned and executed to eschew violence, Ethiopia’s was marred by wanton carnage. Thus the debut of modern Ethiopian politics shadowed by unbridled violence. Fifty years later, the menace of brute force still lies at the heart of politics. 
By the reckoning of the imperial government, father, like many of the intelligentsia, harbored suspect reformist sentiments. Though rewarded with high positions at an early age, there was tension in his relationship with the government. But it was tension devoid of danger for both sides. For the government, father and many of the young Turks, as they were propitiously called by some, posed no danger of subversion. They were impatient for hasty reform from inside, not calamitous revolution from outside. Even if the young Turks had their way, the result would be far less than catastrophic, with some measure of discomfort, they were tolerated. And indeed no sedition was ever intended by the young Turks. All they wanted was to upgrade, not change, the software. This somewhat cozy but uneasy bond between government and intelligentsia was upstaged the day university students flooded the streets in support of the coup attempt. 
In 1960, the year of the coup attempt, Ethiopia’s elite center of learning was cloistered in a lone university college. A full-fledged university had yet to be realized. This was almost a generation after liberation from the Italians. In about the same interval, war-ravaged Germany and Japan had not only reconstructed but were on the verge of crossing new economic frontiers. Ethiopia’s shortcoming was manifestly evident. And finally a new generation scandalized by the inertia, indolence, stoicism and cynicism had risen. It was palpably time for change. 
The 1960s could be credibly dubbed as the decade of student movements. But at its dawn, students nurtured no greater ambition than to be part of the global post-war economic boom. The revered genre of the silent, strong male, which dominated the 1950s, was still paramount. By the mid-1960s, Vietnam radicalized American youth, primarily on its colleges and universities. In France it was another war, Algeria, that was the impetus for campus militancy. In Iran and Europe [think he meant Ethiopia] it was a coup, successful in the case of the former, [a] debacle in the latter. The quartet gave the world the most animated students in history. By the mid-1970s, however, the Americans and French had fizzled out. The Ethiopians and Iranians peaked in the late 1970s, and quietly faded into oblivion in the early 1980s. 
But their fleeting existence notwithstanding they left behind powerful legacies. The backlash against the counter-culture (contempt for authority and tradition) the students triggered in the US made the seminal presidencies of Nixon and Reagan possible. It took the coalition forged by Obama to win a second term to alter the dynamics of American politics. At their peak, Iranian students mesmerized the world by storming the US embassy in Tehran and humiliating a proud superpower. In less than a decade and a half, Ethiopian students inspired a nation to uproot a monarchy that had preserved for a millennium. 
Though they were from four far-flung continents, had distinct histories, and promoted radically different visions, the students shared a common denominator: disdain for the status-quo. To the Americans no one older than 30 was trustworthy. As a way to unshackle tradition, they attacked its prudish sexual mores. The French were unduly agitated against their government, and vented their anger on the streets of Paris with passion unseen since the storming of the Bastille. After rejecting the modernizing pretensions of their foreign-tainted monarch, Iranian students yearned for the purity of a lost age. To the Ethiopian students, groomed by rote learning rather than critical thinking, Marxism became the Holy Grail, the panacea to all the nation’s ills. 
But a pivotal divide also separated them. The Americans and the French lived in free societies. There were adept political parties, vibrant free press, useful civic organizations, multitude of professional and trade unions to channel grievances and represent interests. None of these were about to be supplanted by students. The Ethiopians and Iranians lived in tired monarchies. There were no conduits for dissent. Here was an opening for transformative impact. 
Unlike the Japanese and the Chinese after the madness of the Cultural Revolution, Ethiopian students never really made the crucial connection between the indigenization of science and development. They saw national redemption primarily in the social sciences, and many of the best students flocked to them in droves despite steady underperformance on standardized reading and comprehension tests. To father and his generation, the monarchy was sacrosanct. Very few of them flirted with republicanism. Their ideal was a British monarchy. To the students who were embittered and abruptly radicalized by the events of 1960, the monarchy, and the US, which was implicated in the reversal of the coup attempt, became loathed icons. Embracing socialism seemed only logical and inevitable. And here is where an academic culture chronically short on critical thinking was to have detrimental effect. Whereas in the U.S. and France deep scholarly foundations mitigated against the swamping of the student majority by extremism, in Ethiopia and Iran intellectual buffers against infantile radicalization were ominously absent. But while Iranian students rallied around grassroot sentiments for religious chastity and nationalism, only Ethiopian students militated against all things aboriniginal. Nothing was sacred to them. The emperor was lampooned. Religion was rejected. Culture was mocked. Tradition was attacked. History was disputed. Ethnicity was politicized. It was a tsunami at full thrust against all things established. A good measure of excitement was the intriguing possibility of engineering society from scratch.	But rejection is virtually a carefree venture. There is little strenuous intellectual effort involved. The demanding undertaking lies in the pursuit and nourishment of an alternative consensus. Ultimately, this is where the students failed calamitously. Singularly transfixed with rebellion, and only perfunctorily with its aftermath, they were governed by no moral codes, were disciplined by no hierarchy, and were direly lacking sense of proportion to temper emotions. In this sense, they had no analogue in the Americans or the French. Nor indeed in the Iranians. The Americans and the French were ultimately anchored by nationalism and ingrained identity. The Iranians of course had religion. Having rejected both nationalism and religion, Ethiopian students had nothing durably satiating to replace them with. This was the pristine environment in which militancy thrived. Extremism thus became not a mere idiosyncrasy, but rather the structural building block of the movement. Tragically, what the Ethiopians radicalized was really nothing more than nihilism. The mania was to tear down an existing order. In the end, after the collapse of the imperial order, only a small minority, by now metamorphasized into armed insurgents, had the energy to tread o. The majority was too exhausted to continue, opting for exile and a well-earned rest in the West. 
Of [A] multitude of vague memories from my distant childhood, the sense of dread that permanently enveloped my grandmother’s home, where my mother and I lived intermittently after the divorce, still lingers with me. Years later, in the 1990s, I was to learn, rather to my shock, ours was only one of a handful of families in the neighborhood that mourned the fall of Haile Selassie, the diminutive king who had held sway over the nation for over half a century. Initially I thought it was loss of privilege that explained our anomalous. But I know now there was more.	If one word was to render the spirit of the revolution, it would certainly be equality. An inordinate passion for equality suddenly bewitched the public—what in theory could only have meant equality of opportunity was in practice subverted to imply equality of merit. Not even the elderly, the repository of wisdom in traditional thinking, were to be deferred to anymore. The nation’s best and brightest, whose income, lifestyle and manners marked them from the majority, became more subjects of derision than role models. They were no more in vogue. It was time to celebrate mediocrity, to artificially elevate it to a higher podium. This atmosphere endured, with disastrous consequences for the entire reign of the military dictatorship, the guardian of the revolution and still influences the present. It is this pauperization of value that lies at the provenance o fthe national malaise that has numbed the intellectual elite. 
To be fair, many nations, including the meritocratic U.S., where guilt-ridden 2008 (2012?) presidential candidate Mitt Romney was bullied for his wealth, occasionally toy with debased populism, but rarely has it persisted with the kind of intensity evident in Ethiopia. It was this slide to debauched populism that distressed grandmother’s household. It was a prescient reserve that anticipated an impending moral morass. 
The ultimate failure of the military dictatorship, including its gross human rights violations, is the failure of Communism. But even within the narrow constraints of communism, more was possible. The Soviets failed broadly but compensated with a world-class military-industrial complex. Nothing works in Cuba except health services, one of the best in Latin America. Mao’s China at least liberated a billion plus mass of humanity from worry about its quotidian meals. Ditto for many Communist countries, where a lone bright spot attested to the restrained potential of an oppressed people. But because the principal consensus in post-revolutionary Ethiopia had been an unremitting joy derived from the leveling of society, a culture against exceptionalism gained traction. Blending became the default modus operandi both at the individual and group levels. No distinction was made between superiority stemming from privilege and superiority attained by merit. For a government fighting multiple insurgencies, this was a fatal shortcoming. Unable to build a professional army based on merit, it eventually succumbed not to superior force but to weaker adversaries who had assembled meritocratic fighting machines. It took seventeen years, but there was no avoiding it: grandmother was vindicated. And she lived to see it all. God bless her soul. 
Sadly, the implosion of the military dictatorship did not necessarily entail reorientation of national disposition. On the contrary, unlike their less fortunate, American, French and Iranian brethren, Ethiopian students, untempered by outside influence, ascended to power in 1991 and had their nation at their complete mercy. And they did what was unthinkable to everyone but the puritan nihilist: facilitated—nay, promoted—the secession of Eritrea, the heartland of historical Ethiopia. Whether the nation will survive the shock that ensued is still an open question. 
But while this is where we are, our future is not predestined. The future is malleable, at least in its mid to long-term facets. This is God’s way of internalizing hope into our existence. And best of all, the age of the students is fading. Consider recent events. 
Even in sane democracies, the death of a nation’s leader can be the slow motion drama that it customarily is in autocracies. In contentedly democratic Ghana, where the specter of succession no more bodes the possibility of bloodletting, the president’s ill-health was the state’s most guarded secret. When John Atta Mills finally spoke of his illness, it was to insist of a successful cure. In the spirit of the famous adage, he wanted a return to normalcy. What he lacked, though, was an obliging public. This is Ghana, after all. Cynicism, one could argue plausibly, is a national brand. But in the end, even his deputy and successor, John Mahama, could not help but be caught unawares by his boss’s abrupt transition. 
In increasingly Orwellian Ethiopia, the mere mention of the leader’s ailment required a radical departure from an entrenched—and prized—ethos of opacity. The enduringly hapless Ethiopian public does not expect to be told the truth by its government. The absence, not the histrionics itself, would have surprised Ethiopians. Thus only the hopelessly guileless were surprised by the delayed news of the leader’s death. 
The paranoia is hardly misplaced. The death of despots has altered the course of national histories scores of times, and sometimes even world history.	One of the greatest empires in world history, that of Alexander the Great, simply collapsed with news of his early death; clearing the path for the rise of the Romans. The inopportune death of Odedai Khan saved Europe from an unstoppable Mongolian invading army in 1241. Had the Mongolians overrun Europe as they did China, world history would have changed beyond recognition. Along with the body of Oliver Cromwell was buried the political prospect of republicanism in 17th century England. Ominously, cautionary tales from local history are hardly in want. The legacies of Ethiopia’s last four kings, stretching from mid-19th century to mid-20th century, have all been marred by lack of continuity. And now there is the instinctive inkling by Ethiopia’s ruling party that history is about to repeat itself. But this time, absence of an enduring legacy awaits not merely a leader or party but an entire generation, the spirited students of the 1960s. Theirs will mostly be a legacy of infamy. To paraphrase Reagan, a legacy meant for the trash bin of history. 
Life is tragically short. But only when challenged by a mid-life crisis, or when shock is triggered by illness or accident, does existence’s fleeting status dominate consciousness. How people react to the challenge is a measure of character. The broad motions people go through, however, are well established. There is the initial dazed realization of how disloyally momentary life is, then a reaction abounds, and finally, either stoically or grudgingly, acceptance of the inevitable assumes primacy. Prison has been the triggering element for me. And however exalted, the cause of justice is that has landed me here. I miss you and your mother terribly. The pain is almost physical. But in this plight of our family is embedded hope of a long suffering people. There is no greater honor. We must bear any pain, travel any distance, climb any mountain, cross any ocean to complete this journey to freedom. Anything less is impoverishment of our soul. God bless you, my son. You will always be in my prayers.

The case is about who should be excluded from the protections of the 1951 Refugee Convention, for having committed a serious non-political crime prior to arriving in Canada. The government is arguing that someone who committed this type of crime is forever barred from applying for refugee status in Canada, and that any other factors – such as having served a sentence, the lengthy passage of time, or complete rehabilitation – are irrelevant. Furthermore, under the current legal framework, many people are being excluded for having committed crimes that should not qualify as serious. 
Amnesty International intervened in Febles in order to share our expertise on how international human rights law should be interpreted and applied in Canada. Our lawyers, from Juristes Power, were Jennifer Klinck, Perri Ravon, Michael Sabet, and Justin Dubois.We argued that the relevant provision of the Refugee Convention – Article 1F(b) – is only concerned with people who are fugitives from justice. Once someone has been fairly tried and punished for his or her crime, this provision should not apply and the person should be allowed to seek refugee status. This interpretation is supported by a number of sources, including decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada, the humanitarian purpose of the Refugee Convention, as well as this treaty’s drafting history. 
Also intervening in the case were the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Council for Refugees, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
Amnesty International is hopeful that the Supreme Court of Canada will reach a decision that will render this country’s law on 1F(b) exclusions more fair and rational. Being granted asylum is not a trivial matter of achieving a certain status (that of a refugee), but is rather the realization of a fundamental human right – to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution. Canadian decision-makers should be extremely cautious in applying a clause that excludes individuals from accessing the entirety of the protections conferred by the Refugee Convention.

There is nothing bogus about the real life events which Gary shared with me. As a gay man in a small Caribbean Island country he tells me he had no social life. He was afraid of being out in public, and pretty much went from home to work and not much else. He had a job but was repeatedly the target of verbal and psychological abuse as a man who everyone suspected was gay.

There were no shelters or social groups for him to turn to. He never got beaten up, but that was because he didn’t put himself into dangerous situations. He thought the best way to stay safe was to stay under the radar and not make himself visible. The laws in his country provide for a 15 year prison sentence for homosexual acts. He knew it would be foolish to make complaints about mistreatment which might only draw further unwanted attention.

Gary knows there is nothing bogus about the life he leads today; hiding for fear of stigma, discrimination and violence; being despised by his family and afraid to go outdoors. And there was nothing bogus about the brief fleeting flirtation he had with freedom while living openly as a gay man in Canada for a few short years.

Gary feels the hurt and hate behind the word “bogus.” He applauds efforts to speak out against such language and wants us to know that just because someone’s claim is denied that that does NOT make it bogus.

Gary is looking for a place where he can live and be free from discrimination, violence and hate. He wants to return to Canada.

Gary feels the hurt and hate behind the word “bogus.” He applauds efforts to speak out against such language and wants us to know that just because someone’s claim is denied that that does NOT make it bogus.   
Gary is looking for a place where he can live and be free from discrimination, violence and hate. He wants to return to Canada. 
I wish I had a magic wand.

This time last year, Toronto resident and Canadian citizen Hamid Ghassemi-Shall, was in an Iranian prison, facing the prospect of execution by a regime that is notorious for use of the death penalty. Hamid was eventually one of the lucky ones. The tireless efforts of his wife Antonella and worldwide appeals by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations and governments making direct appeals to the Iranian government managed to save him from execution and overturn an unjust and fabricated case that could easily have cost him his life. 
,  
On 10 October, World Day Against the Death Penalty coincidentally, Hamid returned home to Canada where his wife and supporters gathered at Toronto Pearson Airport to welcome him. 
,  
Today, 27 March 2014, Amnesty International has released our Annual Report on the Death Penalty, covering statistics for 2013. Compared to last year there have been some setbacks. A small number of countries resumed executions and due to continued increases in executions in the Middle East, the overall number of executions has seen a rise. However these numbers do continue to be a part of the long term decline in the death penalty. In our immediate neighbour to the south, total executions were again down along with death sentences, and the state of Maryland repealed the death penalty.

At least three people were executed in Saudi Arabia for crimes committed when they were under the age of 18. By international law these are child executions.

This coming December, Canada has yet again been offered the opportunity to finally join with the world’s leadership against the death penalty and co-sponsor a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly. Since 2007 there have been four such resolutions, calling on those countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty, to impose moratoriums on executions with a view to abolition, or at the very least, to abide by international standards and safeguards, such as the right to a fair trial and that where the death penalty is imposed, it is done so only for the most serious of crimes, i.e., intentional crimes involving the loss of life. Violations of such standards and safeguards are frequent – as this year’s report shows – and yet these standards are bare minimum expectations.

The end of the death penalty is in sight and Canada should be helping lead the abolition effort, especially by taking steps that cost nothing (co-sponsorship is as simple as a phone call or raising a hand at a meeting). As Hamid’s case shows, Canadian citizens are not protected from facing the death penalty until the world is free of it. 
,  
We are fortunate to live in a fully abolitionist country. Many in the world do not. In some countries the public are forced to face it in their streets, as people are hanged or beheaded in the open. People are arrested on bogus crimes – North Korea even executed people for watching a soap opera! The power to kill an imprisoned human being is a power no state should have. There is no such thing as a ‘responsible use of the death penalty.’ 
, 	There is a moral imperative here. A good analogy is to imagine seeing someone who can’t swim, pushed into a river. While Canada is not pushing anyone into a river, by failing to co-sponsor, we are doing the moral equivalent of not even bothering to call for help as the non-swimmer rushes past in the river.

Canada must stop being a silent witness to this atrocity to human rights. As long as the death penalty continues in this world there is a moral obligation to speak out against it.

At least 778 people were executed in 22 countries in 2013. In 2012, Amnesty International reported at least 682 executions in 21 countries worldwide. 
,  
Most executions took place in China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, USA and Somalia – in that order. 
,  
China executed more people than the rest of the world put together – but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in China is unknown as data is considered a state secret, and the figure of 778 excludes the thousands of executions carried out in China. 
,  
There were stark rises in executions in Iran and Iraq. Iraq put at least 169 people to death, a 30% increase on 2012 (129). In Iran, officially acknowledged executions rose to at least 369 in 2013 – from at least 314 in 2012. But credible sources reported at least another 335 executions, bringing 2013’s total to at least 704. 
,  
During 2013, only 22 countries, about one in 10 of all countries worldwide, carried out executions – one more than in 2012, but down almost by a quarter from a decade ago (28 countries executed in 2003). 
,  
140 countries worldwide, more than two-thirds, are abolitionist in law or practice. 
,  
Commutations or pardons of death sentences were recorded in 32 countries in 2013 – up from 27 in 2012. 
,  
At least 1,925 death sentences were recorded in 57 countries in 2013, an increase from the 2012 figures (at least 1,722 death sentences in 58 countries). 
,  
At least 23,392 people were on death row at the end of 2013. 
,  
In 2013, four countries that had not used the death penalty for long periods carried out executions: Indonesia (first execution in four years), Kuwait (first execution in six years), Nigeria (first execution in seven years) and Viet Nam (first executions in 18 months). 
,  
Three countries that executed in 2012 did not carry out any executions in 2013 –Gambia, Pakistan and United Arab Emirates. 
,  
The following methods of execution were used across the world: beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. 
,  
At least three people were executed in Saudi Arabia for crimes that were allegedly committed when they were under 18 years of age, in violation of international law. There were reports of possible juvenile offenders being executed in Yemen and Iran. 
,  
In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the proceedings did not meet international fair trial standards. In some countries this included the extraction of ‘confessions’ through torture or other ill-treatment, for example in Afghanistan, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority (Hamas authorities, Gaza) and Saudi Arabia. 
,  
In India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Sudan, prisoners were not informed of their forthcoming execution, nor were their lawyers and families. In Botswana, India and Nigeria, and in some cases in Iran and Saudi Arabia, the bodies of executed prisoners were not returned to their families for burial. 
,  
Public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. 
,  
People continued to be sentenced to death and executed for offences that do not meet the “most serious crimes” threshold of “involving intentional killing” as defined in international standards. These offences included drug-related crimes in at least 13 countries in Asia and the Middle East, as well as “adultery” (Saudi Arabia), “blasphemy” (Pakistan), economic crimes (China, North Korea, Viet Nam), rape (Iran, Kuwait, Somalia, UAE) and forms of “aggravated” robbery (Kenya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan). 
,  
In North Korea, people were reportedly executed for cannibalism, embezzlement, pornography, escaping to China, corruption, and watching banned videos from South Korea. 
,  
,  
At least 64 executions were carried out in five countries, an increase of more than a half from 2012 (41). 
,  
This was mainly due to a stark rise in executions in Somalia – at least 34 in 2013, compared to at least six in 2012. 19 of the recorded executions in 2013 took place in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. 
,  
Nigeria resumed executions, implementing death sentences for the first time since 2006. Four men were hanged in the southern state of Edo in June. 
,  
Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan accounted for more than 90% of all executions and two-thirds of all death sentences in the region. 
,  
,  
The USA was the only country in the region to carry out executions, 39 in 2013 (four less than in 2012). Only nine states executed in 2013, the same number as in 2012 – the state of Texas alone accounted for 41% of all executions. In May, Maryland became the 18th abolitionist US state. 
,  
In Central and Southern America and the Caribbean, a total of 15 death sentences were recorded in four countries, but otherwise the regions were death penalty-free in 2013. 
,  
Three countries in the Greater Caribbean – Grenada, Guatemala and Saint Lucia – reported empty death rows for the first time since Amnesty Internationals started keeping records in 1980. 
,  
,  
At least 37 executions were carried out in ten countries in the region. This figure does not include the thousands of executions that are believed to have been carried out in China, which executed more people than the rest of the world put together. But the true extent of the use of the death penalty in China is unknown as data is treated as a state secret. 
,  
Indonesia carried out its first executions in four years in November. Five people were put to death in 2013, including two foreign nationals convicted on drug trafficking charges. 
,  
Viet Nam resumed executions after an 18 month-hiatus, putting seven people to death by lethal injection during the year. 
,  
Singapore continued not to implement death sentences. Pakistan again suspended executions, having put one person to death in 2012. 
,  
It was impossible to confirm the real number of executions in North Korea. Reliable reports indicated that at least 70 executions were carried out, but Amnesty International believes the actual figure to be much higher. 
,  
,  
The region was an execution-free zone in 2013. 
,  
Belarus, the only country to still use the death penalty, did not carry out any executions in 2013, the first year free from executions since 2009. Four death sentences were imposed, some after manifestly unfair trials. 
,  
,  
At least 638 executions were carried out in six countries. Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 95 per cent of all confirmed executions in the region. 
,  
It could not be confirmed if executions took place in Egypt or Syria. 
,  
Both Iran and Iraq saw alarming rises in executions – see above. 
,  
Kuwait resumed executions for the first time since 2007, by hanging five men during the year. 
,  
For the first time in three years the United Arab Emirates did not put anyone to death.

MYTH #1 
The death penalty deters violent crime and makes society safer. 
FACT	There is no convincing evidence that the death penalty has a unique deterrent effect.   
More than three decades after abolishing the death penalty, Canada’s murder rate remains over one third lower than it was in 1976. 
A 35-year study compared murder rates between Hong Kong, where there is no death penalty, and Singapore, which has a similar size population and executed regularly. The death penalty had little impact on crime rates. 
MYTH #2	The threat of execution is an effective strategy in preventing terrorist attacks. 
FACT	The prospect of execution is unlikely to act as a deterrent to people prepared to kill and injure for the sake of a political or other ideology. 
Indeed, some officials responsible for counter-terrorism have repeatedly pointed out that those who are executed can be perceived as martyrs whose memory becomes a rallying point for their ideology or organizations. 
Armed opposition groups have also pointed to the use of the death penalty as a justification for reprisals, thereby continuing the cycle of violence. 
MYTH #3	The death penalty is fine as long as the majority of the public supports it. 
FACT	History is littered with human rights violations that were supported by the majority, but which were subsequently looked upon with horror. 
Slavery, racial segregation and lynching all had support in the societies where they occurred but constituted gross violations of the people’s human rights. Ultimately, the duty of governments is to protect the rights of all individuals, even though sometimes this means acting against the views of the majority. 
Moreover, public opinion often changes depending on political leadership and when objective information on the death penalty is provided to the public. 
MYTH #4	All people who are executed have been proven guilty of serious crimes. 
FACT	Around the world, hundreds of prisoners are executed after grossly unfair trials. This can include the use of “confessions” extracted under torture, the denial of access to lawyers and inadequate legal representation. 
The countries that execute the most are also the ones where serious concerns exist about the fairness of the justice system, such as in China, Iran and Iraq. 
The 144 exonerations of death row prisoners recorded in the USA since 1973 show that, regardless of how many legal safeguards are in place, no justice system is free from error. As long as human justice remains fallible, the risk of executing the innocent can never be eliminated. 
MYTH #5	Relatives of murder victims demand capital punishment. 
FACT	The worldwide anti-death penalty movement includes many who have lost their loved ones to, or have themselves been victims of, violent crime, but for ethical or religious reasons do not want the death penalty imposed “in their name”. In the USA, organizations such as “Murder Victims’ Families for Human Rights” are driving the movement to abolish the death penalty, for example, in New Hampshire.

The Twitter shutdown started at about 11pm on Thursday night. My telephone started to ring: had I heard that Twitter was blocked? There was confusion about who could access Twitter, who couldn’t, and why. And would the government really take this step – such a brazen attack on freedom of expression – just a week before the local elections? 
	Yes, that’s just what they have done. Five days on, Twitter is still blocked in Turkey and there is no sign of when the ban might be lifted. 
	It wasn’t a complete surprise. Four hours before it was shut down, Turkey’s Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had threatened to “wipe out” Twitter at an election rally. And as he has said since, he personally gave the order. It’s a textbook example of how policy is made – and human rights infringed – in Turkey. 
 
	By 1am on Friday morning, a lot of people had worked out how to get around the ban by changing their computer and smartphone settings – effectively hiding their geographical location. Jargon like DNS (Domain Name System) and VPN (Virtual Private Network) – previously only found in tech geek vocabulary – became common currency in Turkey overnight. 
	Google’s popular public DNS was shared on social media and scrawled as graffiti on walls. The day after the ban came into force, Twitter traffic in Turkey was reported to be 30% higher than the previous day. Over the weekend the authorities moved to a different form of blocking that is harder to get around, but lots of people are still tweeting in Turkey. 
	Why would the government persist in this widely criticized and ultimately futile attempt to silence Twitter? 
	The answer lies somewhere between a manifest intolerance of dissent, and the alleged tapped telephone conversations substantiating corruption allegations against government officials. Twitter has been a major platform for both. 
	Ironically, the Prime Minister – himself an avid Twitter user – is incensed by its role as a megaphone for critical voices. 
	Despite this apparent own goal, the move only makes sense as part of a broader strategy to curb free expression on the internet. When the authorities amended the county’s internet law in February, they unleashed widespread powers to block internet content. It’s questionable whether the Twitter block is legal even under this law, as there was no court order to authorise the ban. 
What Turkish Google searches tell us about the Twitter ban http://t.co/uPWOk8utNU pic.twitter.com/QJdLmaDBX6 
	— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 25, 2014 
 
The Prime Minister has since said that Facebook and YouTube, both of which have offices in Turkey, represent a threat to national security, insinuating that they too could be blocked. The authorities now want Twitter to have a representative in Turkey. Someone who could be subjected to government pressure? 
	All this adds up to an ominous warning of what the future may hold. The mainstream media in Turkey is already cowed to the government. The question now is whether social media will go the same way. 
	Could the Prime Minister or one of his advisers just call up a social media company and order it to remove content? According to a now infamous conversation leaked recently, that’s just what the PM did with the Editor in Chief of Turkey’s HaberTurk news channel last June: requesting that live highlights from of an opposition party leader’s speech be removed from TV screens. 
	Social media companies, their users and anyone who values free expression should be alive to this danger and speak out against it, including on social media.

	Two decades of stuttering human rights reform in Ukraine was almost scuppered overnight when, on 16 January this year, the Parliament in Kyiv railroaded through a raft of new legislation to restrict the freedoms of expression, association and assembly. 
 
A virtual carbon-copy of laws adopted in neighbouring Russia in recent years, they were tailor-made to give the Ukrainian authorities increased powers to prosecute those involved in the anti-government protests in Kyiv’s central Maydan Square, as well as silence dissent more widely. 
President Yanukovich must have hoped that the ranks of peaceful protesters would be cowed: they weren’t. As with earlier attempts to violently disperse them, their numbers simply swelled, as the list of grievances grew. Violence bred violence, and a month later the world watched with horror as the protest reached its bloody conclusion. 
Fast-forward a month, and Yanukovich has now fled to Russia, his corruption exposed, his government deposed and his party’s majority in the parliament decimated by defections. 
The new government is not without its own problems – there is lingering impunity for the EuroMaydan violence, and just this week the head of the leading TV channel was violently attacked over his editorial policies by a member of parliament who stormed the studio with his thugs. 
Reforms that successive governments have failed to introduce will not be made easier by the huge economic challenges the country now faces, the lingering menace of further Russian intervention in the east and the motley crew of far-right nationalists that played their part in bringing down the government and who have reaped their reward with important posts in the new administration. They will have to work hard to ensure that all Ukrainians feel they have an equal share in their country’s future. 
And then there is the Crimea. President Putin appears to have got what he wanted. As have the majority of Crimeans: not that the region’s ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tartars felt invited to freely express their views on the matter. 
Many in the Crimea will feel that they have finally come home. But if anyone really thinks that the raising of the Russian flag over their civic buildings will do anything to improve governance, root out corruption, or strengthen democratic participation in the running of their affairs, they are likely to be quickly disabused of the notion – and left with little room to object. 
On 18 March, when President Putin stood in the Kremlin’s gilded halls and set the seal on what was effectively a military take-over, he exported Russian laws to the peninsula. With the stroke of a pen, Crimeans will now be bound by a different set of rules. And this will have a devastating impact on their ability to exercise their human rights. 
They should heed the warnings of recent history. When President Putin’s current term began on 7 May 2012, he spoke in favour of greater participation of citizens in public affairs and encouraged greater consultation across society about legal reforms. But the reverse has happened. 
The Russian authorities’ response to peaceful protest was perhaps best illustrated by the brutal crackdown on an opposition demonstration in Bolotnaya Square on the eve of Putin’s inauguration speech. As tens of thousands took to the streets, they were herded into a narrow corridor by baton-wielding riot police. Hundreds were arrested and scores injured in the chaos that ensued. 
At the show trials of arrested Bolotnaya activists last month, even the international spotlight of the Sochi Olympic Games failed to stem the fervour with which the state apparatus put down peaceful protest outside the Moscow court. Hundreds more were arrested. 
Over the past two years, ordinary Russians, and not just the most vocal critics, have seen their freedoms steadily steamrolled by the authorities. A number of new legislative and administrative measures have been introduced that breach not only international legal obligations, but Russia’s own Constitution. 
They include: 
Don’t expect Crimeans to engage in an informed public debate about this “made in Russia” repression which is already beginning to take hold in the peninsula. 
They won’t be able to. In Russia, state control has been consolidated over a prominent news agency, critical news websites and blogs blocked and threatened with prosecution, the editor and director of an influential independent media outlet sacked, and a popular cable news channel taken off the air by several satellite providers. 
The warning signs are clear. In Crimea, the crackdown is coming. But the repression won’t be televised.

However, it’s doubtful such support includes the  hundreds of thousands of people – including children – that languish in  political prison camps and other detention facilities. Or those that have been the victims of  crimes against humanity as documented in a chilling U.N. report made  public last month.  Indeed, the  U.N. Commission of Inquiry report was unprecedented, stating: “The  gravity, scale and nature of these violations…does not have any parallel  in the contemporary world.” 
When  the full horror of the atrocities committed by North Korea against its own citizens was laid bare, support for the  Commission’s comprehensive findings was swift among many in the  international community. But such statements of support will not bring  to an end the systematic torture, executions,  rape, or forced labor inflicted upon North Koreans by their own  government. Nor will it ensure those responsible for these crimes  against humanity are brought to justice. 
 
With  Pyongyang refusing to even acknowledge that such crimes are taking place, the international  community’s tough rhetoric needs to be matched by genuine action. 
The  first test comes Monday in Geneva, when the Commission of Inquiry’s report is formally presented at the U.N. Human  Rights Council. A strong resolution needs to be adopted sending a clear  message to Kim that the Commission’s recommendations will be acted upon  and not kicked into the diplomatic long-grass. 
However,  with China, Cuba and Russia having taken seats on the Council in January, the consensus that established the Commission  of Inquiry last March is by no means guaranteed going forward.  The  reality is that some states are prepared to turn a blind eye to the most  horrendous human rights violations on the pretext of a so-called principled position. 
China  and other countries’ refusal to cease the unlawful practice of forcibly returning  people to a country where they face persecution, torture and death is  shameful. But the Commission’s authoritative report represents the best  opportunity in years to increase pressure on North Korea to address the grave violations. The international community  will have failed the millions of people whose suffering is unimaginable if political wrangling once again obstructs effective action. 
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon can also act by referring the Commission’s report to the Security Council as a matter of urgency. Human  rights have been the elephant in the room at the Security Council, with the United States,  China and others focused instead on North Korea’s nuclear program.  Meanwhile, insufficient attention has been given to the enormity of the  grave violations taking place. Human rights must now be placed center stage when the Security Council considers peace and  security on the Korean Peninsula. 
There  are other ways the U.N. system can act. Agencies that operate in North Korea, such as UNICEF and the World Food  Programme, can play an important role by better addressing human rights  concerns through their work. Such action has the potential to deliver  immediate tangible results.	With  North Korea having dismissed the Commission’s findings, the onus is on all other U.N. member states to ensure its  recommendations are taken forward, including ensuring those responsible  for crimes against humanity face justice. 
It  is only through such coordinated action to end the “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations” that the  international community can demonstrate its absolute support for the  people of North Korea.

	Activists, lawyers, judges, trial observers and the UN itself have used Amnesty’s Fair Trial Manual to defend human rights worldwide. Political prisoners, including Albin Kurti from Kosovo, have also used the book to represent themselves in court. 
	Albin is the leader of Kosovo’s Lëvizja VETËVENDOSJE! (Movement for Self-Determination!). He was arrested during a peaceful protest in 2007 and tried by the UN interim authorities in Kosovo (UNMIK). He told us his story. 
“Lëvizja VETËVENDOSJE! demonstrated peacefully against the so-called Ahtisaari Plan for Kosovo’s future in 2007,” he told us. “We believed it would be damaging and increase social misery.” 
“UNMIK police began shooting at us with rubber bullets. Some people were shot in the face. Two protesters died and more than 80 were injured. I and other activists were beaten, kicked and sprayed with pepper spray, and one woman was knocked unconscious. In total, 16 of us were arrested and imprisoned. 
“I was targeted as the movement’s leader. I spent five months in prison and another five under house arrest. I was interrogated only once, for 30 minutes. Isolation was a greater priority than investigation. My detention conditions were not good; I was labelled a ‘Category A’ prisoner and held with people serving sentences of 25-30 years.  
“When my trial began, a friend gave me the Amnesty International Fair Trial Manual. I read it thoroughly and started to see myself not only as a political activist suffering the injustice of the system, but also as a human being with rights and liberties. This equipped me for my struggle. 
“My trial had many irregularities, including the fact that all my defence lawyers were appointed by UNMIK. So UNMIK was prosecuting, judging and defending me at the same time. I therefore didn’t accept my defence counsel, and ended up representing myself. 
“The Fair Trial Manual made me aware of the multitude of cases similar to mine from all over the world. I drew many important lessons. I also became aware of the human rights laws and mechanisms that I had been denied. It taught me to prepare myself much better for questioning prosecution witnesses and following court sessions. 
”Eventually, seven different lawyers resigned from defending me when they saw that it was a show trial. Their civil disobedience set me free. 
“The media organization Top Media voted me ‘Personality of the Year’ in 2011. The same year, VETËVENDOSJE! won 14 seats in Kosovo’s parliamentary elections, showing the success of our movement. 
“My detention and trial made me understand Kosovo’s international system much better and helped me fight more effectively. To other activists I say: Organise, act and never underestimate the power of insistence.”

A girl was hospitalized when she fell ill after starvation drove her family to kill and eat a dog. Others have been admitted for illness caused by eating a waxy mixture of sugar and water used by women to remove body hair. These are just a couple of the horror stories medical workers in Yarmouk, in southern Damascus, have shared with us about life under siege. 
 
Medical workers are correspondingly impacted in the treatment they can provide the sick, the injured and the starving. Facilities have been devastated by the crippling siege imposed by Syrian government forces for more than a year. During the siege, soldiers have arrested 12 medical workers – the fate of six of whom remains unknown – and many others have fled. Medical stores have been destroyed in shelling and looted by armed opposition groups. 
As we documented in our report this week, Squeezing the life out of Yarmouk: War crimes against besieged civilians, 194 individuals, all believed to be civilians, have died in the neighbourhood as a result of the siege – mostly due to starvation and the lack of medical care. Since issuing the report, we have received information on 14 other civilians who have died as a result of the siege. One was Diyab Mahena, a medical worker who died on 11 March from injuries sustained a month ago, when he was shot leaving the partially functioning Palestine Hospital in Yarmouk. 
The 20,000 or so Palestinian and Syrian civilians trapped and starving inside Yarmouk are among a quarter of a million civilians being besieged by armed forces – mostly government forces – across Syria. A staggering figure. And these are among more than 9.3 million people in Syria in need of humanitarian assistance. A figure that tests the imagination. 
To meet their needs, it is desperately vital that Syrian government forces lift the sieges of Yarmouk and other civilian areas. They must allow unfettered access to humanitarian agencies to assist the civilians suffering, not only in those areas but country-wide; all parties must permit aid to reach those who need it by the most efficient means available, including across borders and across conflict lines. 
These calls that Amnesty International and others are making upon the Syrian government, as well as similar ones upon armed opposition groups, are among countless calls that we have made over the last three years. 
Tragically, the Syrian government has refused to respond positively to almost any of our requests. It has continued to use excessive force – including lethal force – against peaceful protesters. It has continued to detain – and torture and otherwise ill-treat – suspected critics. Syrian government armed forces have continued to target civilians and civilian objects, such as hospitals and schools. They have continued to carry out indiscriminate attacks. They have continued to deny access to the UN-mandated Commission of Inquiry to independently investigate what’s happening in the country. And so on, and so on… 
The calls we and others have made on armed opposition groups have also fallen mostly on deaf ears. 
Amnesty International and other human rights and humanitarian organizations continue to stand in solidarity with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict. © withsyria.org 
The intolerable hardships that the people of Syria have had to face – and will continue to face for some time to come – make it more important than ever that Amnesty International and other human rights and humanitarian organizations continue to stand in solidarity with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict. We will seek to investigate and to document war crimes and crimes against humanity, to campaign and to lobby for those abuses to end, and to call for everyone suspected of ordering or committing them to be brought to justice. 
At least some of our calls were belatedly taken up by the UN Security Council, on 22 February, in Resolution 2139. So now is an opportune time for everyone to come together and demand that the Syrian government comply and end the sieges, the killing and maiming of civilians, the deliberate starvation, the torture and arbitrary detention. 
This mobilization on behalf of civilians in Syria includes vigils on and around 13 March 2014, when we will be joining thousands of activists around the world to show that we stand #withSyria.

Earlier today, Amnesty International Canada released a press statement expressing deep disappointment over the recommendations in the final report of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women. Indigenous peoples’ organizations, human rights groups, and federal opposition political parties also condemned the report as promoting the status quo and failing to make comprehensive, concrete, time bound recommendations to prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
,  
“Indigenous women and girls – and indeed all Canadians – deserve better from our Parliament,” said Alex Neve, Secretary-General of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “Government ministers keep saying that they want action, not just talk, on violence against Indigenous women. But when given the opportunity to make a commitment to meaningful action, the government keeps endorsing the status quo.”

When a woman named “Beatriz” stood up for her rights in April and May 2013 and demanded her human right to life, Amnesty International supporters joined forces with local and international activists. Together you echoed Beatriz’s voice, again and again, until the authorities finally listened. 
Aged 22 and from El Salvador, Beatriz suffers from severe illnesses, including lupus and kidney problems. When she became pregnant, doctors told her that continuing her pregnancy could kill her. Her foetus was also anencephalic, lacking a large part of its brain and skull, and would not survive for more than a few hours after birth. 
But doctors feared being prosecuted under El Salvador’s total abortion ban, and felt that their hands were tied by a law so extreme that only a handful of countries worldwide have chosen to impose similar legislation. This is because such laws pose a serious risk to women and girls. 
 
Amnesty activists in 22 countries campaigned tirelessly alongside Beatriz, sending over 170,000 signatures to the Salvadoran government. Experts from the UN and the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights demanded that the Salvadoran government provide Beatriz with the life-saving treatment she needed. 
After Beatriz had campaigned for over two months to receive the treatment she needed to stay alive, she was finally granted a caesarean section in June 2013. As doctors had predicted, the foetus lived for just a few hours after birth. 
After her harrowing ordeal, Beatriz thanked people worldwide for putting pressure on the authorities. “Without you I think I wouldn’t have been able to stand being in hospital,” she wrote in a letter. “I hope my example serves so that other women won’t have to go through what I suffered.” 
Back with her family, Beatriz regained strength. On December 2, 2013, she filed a case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. A key part of her demand is that the state should guarantee that what happened to her is never allowed to happen to someone else. 
Beatriz is also seeking redress from the government for having violated her human rights, including her rights to life and health, and to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
Through Amnesty’s My Body My Rights campaign, Amnesty supporters can continue to campaign to make sure that every woman and girl in El Salvador and anywhere else in the world has access to life and health-saving medical treatment when they need it. Extreme criminal laws, such as El Salvador’s total abortion ban, are cruel. These laws have discrimination at their heart and must be repealed.

Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Loretta Saunders, a young Inuk women who went missing in Halifax on February 13th and whose body was found in New Brunswick on February 26th. Loretta was from Labrador, attending Saint Mary’s University in Halifax and working on her honors thesis on the subject of missing and murdered aboriginal women. 
,  
I had the privilege of meeting several of Loretta’s family members and friends. In the days following the tragic news of her death, her family gracefully reached out to the community in gratitude and to ensure that the issue close to Loretta’s heart isn’t forgotten.  Efforts have now turned to carrying on the light of Loretta’s legacy by raising awareness, working to prevent violence against Indigenous women and by drawing attention to the higher risks they face. 
,  
Upon their arrival in Halifax, family, friends and volunteers mobilized quickly at the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre to aid in search efforts and to spread the word of Loretta’s disappearance. Posters were shared and hung here and across Canada. There were numerous contributions by generous community members and organizations, who offered a headquarters in Uniacke Square for family and volunteers and donations of time, materials, printing and meals. 
,  
Because of the selfless strength of Loretta’s family, her life and work will be known by many. This tragic event brought together a new, tightly-knit community of people from all walks of life who are dedicated to raising awareness of the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women. There are ongoing discussions about carrying forward Loretta’s work and plans for a nation-wide vigil to honour her and all the “Stolen Sisters”. There will be a vigil held in Ottawa on Parliament Hill Wednesday, March 5th at noon. The life of this beautiful young woman and her dedication to raising awareness will carry on in the hearts and minds of many.

The Tsilhqot’in people have consistently opposed plans to mine near Teztan Biny or Fish Lake which is part of their traditional territory in central British Columbia. 
,  
The federal government’s decision to reject the mine follows a report released on October 31 in which the federal panel appointed to carry out an environmental impact assessment of the proposed mine concluded that it would have “severe” impacts on the Tsilhqot’in and “significant” long-term, and irreversible impacts on water quality in Teztan Biny, on fish habitat, and on wetlands ecosystems. 
,  
Because this area is so vital to the Tsilhqot’in, the review panel determined that the environmental impacts would cause “high magnitude, “long-term” and “irreversible” harm to “the Tsilhqot’in. This harm would include denying them use of an area vital for “traditional activities, cultural and spiritual practices, intergenerational transfer of culture and knowledge, and traditional values.” 
,  
The panel also concluded that approval of the mine would be harmful to the longstanding need to resolve Indigenous land claims in areas affected by the mine. 
,  
The proposed New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine and its operations would affect a substantial portion of the Teztan’Yeqox (Fish Creek) watershed, including Teztan Biny, with Y’anah Biny (Little Fish Lake) and much of the Nabas meadows region being buried under a 12km2 tailings pond. 
,  
As proposed, the mine pit itself could reach a diameter of up to 1.6 km. The mine would be surrounded by an exclusion area of almost 30 km2, off-limits to anyone not involved with the mine. 
,  
These lands are part of the traditional territory of the Tsilhqot’in people and have a unique, continued importance to their lives and culture. As the environmental review panel heard from a wide range of witnesses, the area supports a great diversity of plant and animal life central to the subsistence and ceremonial life of the Tsilhqot’in. It is also one of the few remaining environmentally pristine areas in the region that is easily accessible to elders and youth. 
,  
The independent review panel concluded that the harmful impacts of the project would include: 
,  
• “significant adverse environmental effect on water quality in Fish Lake (Teztan Biny)” 
,  
• “significant adverse effect on fish and fish habitat” 
,  
• “high-magnitude” and “regional” impacts on sensitive wetlands ecosystems that would “extend into the far-future” 
,  
• disturbance to Tsilhqot’in burial and cremation sites 
,  
• preventing the Tsilhqot’in hunting and trapping in the area “for decades.” 
,  
The review panel determined that the impacts on the environment would be “so substantial” – even taking into account the mitigation measures promised by the mine company – that the consequences for “the Tsilhqot’in’s ability to use the area for traditional activities, cultural and spiritual practices, intergenerational transfer of culture and knowledge, and traditional values” would be “high magnitude, “long-term” and “irreversible.” 
,  
The panel also found that the project would interfere with the Aboriginal rights of the neighbouring Esk’etemc and the Stswecem’c Xgat’tem peoples whose lands would be crossed by new powerlines to service the mine. 
,  
In addition, the panel found that the mine development would “interfere significantly” with the settlement of outstanding Aboriginal title claims. 
,  
The panel also concluded that the project would have a negative impact on the efforts that are underway by First Nations to develop alternative forms of income based on tourism which the panel said “could provide Aboriginal people with socio-economic benefits for generations in a manner that allowed for the maintenance of their traditional lifestyle.” 
,  
A nearly identical mine proposal was previously rejected by the federal government on the basis of a negative environmental impact assessment. 
,  
Canadian law, including the Canadian Constitution, recognizes that the Indigenous peoples have inherent rights to their traditional lands and territories. In an important court victory, the Tsilhqot’in have already established ongoing rights to use their traditional territory for activities such as hunting, trapping and the management of wild horses. What remains unresolved in Canadian courts is the extent to which the Tsilhqot’in have an ongoing right to control how their territory is used. The Supreme Court is currently considering a landmark case concerning Tsilhqot’in ownership of a large portion of their traditional territory bordering on the proposed mine site. 
,  
Amnesty International obtained standing in the New Prosperity mine hearings in order to urge the Panel to use international human rights standards, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in assessing the seriousness of the risks posed by the project. Amnesty International welcomes the Panel’s conclusion that the interconnection of Canadian Constitutional protections for Indigenous rights and international human rights law is “particularly relevant” to assessing the project’s impacts on Aboriginal rights. The report summarizes Amnesty’s concerns in this way: 
,  
“Amnesty International stated that while human rights are rarely absolute, a very high and strict standard of precaution is always required in any decision that has the potential to infringe, limit or undermine human rights. Amnesty International submitted that this was especially true in any context where: a particular group such as indigenous nations had already been marginalized, impoverished or disadvantaged by the historic violation of their human rights; or ongoing serious human rights violations such as the denial of their land rights have yet to be addressed and where systemic discrimination continues to bar families and communities from enjoying a standard of living and quality of life comparable to other communities around them.

Amnesty International, like the Tsilhqot’in, underlined that free, prior and informed consent in international law was not a veto. Amnesty International submitted that free, prior and inform consent as it is understood and has been applied in international law, is consistent with the leading Delgamuukw and Haida Nation Supreme Court of Canada decisions which identify consent as being within the spectrum of substantial accommodation required by the constitutional protection of Aboriginal rights. Amnesty International also noted that the Haida Nation decision affirmed the words of the Delgamuukw decision, which recognized that the consent of Aboriginal peoples was a valid, and often necessary, form of accommodation on very serious issues.”

,  
This is the second time that the federal government has rejected plans by Taseko Mines to open a mine near Teztan Biny or Fish Lake in central British Columbia. 
,  
The Tsilhqot’in people have consistently opposed plans to mine near Teztan Biny, calling the proposed New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine the wrong mine at the wrong place. 
,  
In late October, a federally-appointed environmental assessment panel concluded that the proposed mine would have “severe” and “irreversible” impacts on the culture and traditional practices of the Tsilhqot’in people. The panel also found a wide range of serious environmental impacts on the lakes, rivers and wetlands of the area. 
,  
In a decision released on February 26, federal Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq said that the significant environmental impacts of the proposed mine could not be justified. 
,  
Responding to the decision, Chief Joe Alphonse, Tribal Chair for the Tsilhqot’in National Government, said in a public statement: “We commend the federal government for not bowing to industry lobbying and instead respecting the science and the independent process which came to the conclusion that this project would have devastating impacts on the environment and our Nation’s ability to practice our rights in a sacred spiritual site.” 
,  
The Tsilhqot’in people had previously established legal rights to continue cultural practices such as fishing and capture of wild horses throughout their traditional territory. Their ownership of the land and their right to manage it according to their own customs and values is the subject of a case now before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
,  
Amnesty International intervened in the latest environmental review to argue that any assessment of the project’s potential impacts on Indigenous peoples must be consistent with the high standard of protection for Indigenous rights under the Canadian Constitutional and international human rights law.

The panel report cites international human rights standards as one of the factors shaping its determination of the seriousness of the proposal’s protential impacts on the Tsilhqot’in people.

	Zoryan had stayed overnight in Kyiv’s central Maydan Square on 19 February, during the deadliest period of the recent EuroMaydan protests. Clashes that erupted on both 19 and 20 February have resulted in the deaths of in excess of 70 protesters and at least 20 police officers. 
 
Ukraine’s EuroMaydan protests started exactly three months ago today. Never before in my lifetime has the country witnessed such a neglect of human rights and dignity, such an appalling inability of the government to listen to its people and such incredible courage of ordinary people standing for their rights. 
Late last year, when we were launching our first petition against police brutality and impunity, we could not have imagined the extent of abuses by law enforcement officers we would face in January and February 2014. 
When violent clashes with the police broke out again on February 19, our office in Kyiv was forced to close amid the insecurity. I spent that night on the Maydan – the city’s central Independence Square and the epicentre of the protests – when the police moved in and made their third attempt to “cleanse” the area. Earlier in the day more than 30 protesters has been shot dead in central Kyiv. The police were using live ammunition, new Russian stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets, three water cannon and two troop transporters against the protesters. It felt like real war… As the barricades were being removed by the police, the protesters created a wall of fire around them, burning tyres and “everything that burns”, including clothes. 
There were around 5,000 people on the square, and every single person had a role. Some created lines to deliver stones and wheels to the front line, where young people were putting their lives on the line to save ours. I saw thousands of people, full of concentration, dignity and courage. Students, retired people, hipsters, Russian and Ukrainian speakers, academics and miners, from all over the country. I felt proud of them. 
I was standing close to the main stage, when a rubber bullet hit my leg. As it had been fired from far away, I was not injured, and the pain only lasted for around five minutes. When I shouted “ouch”, the people around me turned, ready to help. They were not scared at all. After I told them I was ok, we all laughed together. Two minutes later one of the opposition leaders was injured with a rubber bullet, while speaking on the main stage. Whoever was shooting, was aiming at his face. 
During the following day, 20 February, fresh violence broke out on Maydan Square. In the course of the clashes, more than 60 people were reportedly shot dead by snipers. The protesters regained lost ground in the square and the police forces were pushed back. Our team at Amnesty International Ukraine decided to donate blood, given the high number of casualties – we called at about five different places, but all of them were already full of people already giving blood and didn’t have enough capacity. Our names were put on the list for the next day. 
The metro had been closed down on February 19, and many people left the city or chose not to leave their homes. However, the number of people at Maydan was constantly growing as buses and cars came to Kyiv from all over the country, trying to go around the checkpoints. I met some people from Zhytomir who walked for three hours in the woods to get to the city. 
Most of the people who were shot on Maydan had wounds to their necks. I spoke to one of the doctors – he told me they had no chance of surviving those wounds and that they had clearly been shot by professionals intending to kill. 
 Dozens of bodies were placed at the Maydan and in front of the city administration building. I saw men praying and crying near their dead friends. The total number of those killed is still unknown, but it is well over 70. I was looking through the list of the dead hoping not to find anyone I knew… I didn’t, but many people were not so lucky.

	On Wednesday February 12th the Amnesty’s Action Network on Women’s Human Rights and fellow Amnesty supporters met at the AITO office in Toronto to create Valentine cards for Prime Minister Harper, in support of the Have a Heart Campaign by First Nations Child and Family Services. The campaign aims to raise awareness and promote change regarding the basic human rights of First Nations children and this is the third year in a row the event is being organized in the AI Toronto offices. 
,  
	A lot of colourful and creative cards were made by participants (for many of them this was their first AI event!) and here are some of the heartfelt messages:

,  
,  
,  
, 	We were fortunate to screen Hi-Ho Mistahey!, a 2013 National Film Board of Canada documentary film by internationally acclaimed filmmaker and activist Alanis Obomsawin. The film profiles Shannen’s Dream, an activist campaign launched by Cree teenager Shannen Koostachin,  to lobby for improved educational opportunities for First Nations youth. After the film the audience discussed the inequalities happening in our country and genuine shock was felt by all regarding how long this issue has been in front of our government with very little improvements to this day. 
,  
	I’m however extremely optimistic after witnessing in Hi-Ho Mistahey! the huge youth movement supporting this campaign. I’m proud to take part in Have a Heart Day and will continue to do so until the Canadian Government closes the gaps in funding and services for First Nations children.

 Join us in sending a message urging PM Harper to ensure that every child has the right to a safe and healthy home.

As if the unfolding horror in the Central African Republic could not get any more shocking, the scene we witnessed in a remote town north-west of Bangui, left us stunned. 
We arrived in Bouguere on 13 February to investigate a massacre that had taken place some three weeks earlier. More than 40 people had been killed by anti-balaka militias and most of the town’s Muslim residents had fled. 
But on arrival in the town nothing prepared us for what we found. 
The streets were littered with bodies. We counted 21 including three women and even a baby. Dogs were feeding on some of the corpses. Some of the male victims were partially burned. The feet of one man had been tied together, evidence that that he had been taken prisoner before being executed. The residents said that there were more in the outskirts of the town. 
They had all been killed in an attack by anti-balaka militias on the morning of 10 February, just days before we arrived. 
The small bundles of clothing lying where some of the bodies were found meant that people were caught and killed as they tried to flee. 
The Muslim area of Bouguere was eerily empty. Most of the houses and businesses had been ransacked and some burned down. Those who had not been killed had fled.	And then, we found her. 
Crouching in the corner of an abandoned house, a girl about 11 years old had survived it all. She had been there, alone, without food or water, for four days. She was terrified, could hardly speak and was so weak she could not even stand. 
She said her father was killed in the attack, and residents said her mother had been killed in an earlier assault. The girl was the only Muslim survivor and the Christian residents of the town begged us to take her. We took her to a place of safety. 
What happened in Bouguere was shocking, extremely disturbing, infuriating. 
International peacekeepers were nowhere to be seen, even though the area had already witnessed violent confrontations between anti-balaka militias and Seleka forces resulting in the massacre of civilians three weeks earlier. 
It was one of those places where something tragic was expected to happen but somehow, the international forces, sent to protect civilians were nowhere to be seen. 
Boguere is a mining town, known for its gold and diamond trading, making it particularly attractive to looters.	But these are revenge attacks. Previously, a notorious Seleka commander had made the town his home base, carrying out widespread human rights abuses against the local population and neighbouring villages and towns.	Christian residents recounted the abuses of the Seleka commander, saying that he once killed an entire family because the father had protected two men whom the commander didn’t like. It was the entire region’s fear and hatred of the commander, they said, that stoked the anger and thirst for revenge that lead to the recent attacks against the town’s Muslim population. 
He is believed to have been killed in the massacre on 24 January. 
Sadly, what happened in Bouguere is not an exception. 
The following day, as we drove south to the village of Boboua, we found three bodies lying in front of a mosque. They were the village’s Muslim mayor, Adamou Dewa, his son Abu Bakr and another Muslim resident named Abdou. 
As we left, a frantic group of Muslim residents emerged from their hideouts in the bush and flagged down our vehicle. They told us that anti-balaka fighters had attacked their village three hours earlier and killed the three men. They said that there were only 200 Muslims left and they were under serious threat.	“We were born here,” one of them exclaimed, “where can we go?” 
It was only then that African Union peacekeepers were arriving to ascertain what had happened. Too late for the dead, and they were not going to stay. With no protection, the remaining Muslim residents will have to leave for their own safety. 
Muslims are being brutally murdered or driven away from most towns and villages. 
In Mbaiki, for example, only one Mulsim family remained, out of a previous population of several thousand.	In Yaloke, once home to an estimated 10,000 Muslims, only 742 remained as of 13 February. 
The Muslim community of Boda is being protected from attack by French peacekeeping forces, but only as they prepare to to flee the country. 
The mass killing of civilians, destruction of homes, businesses and mosques are being used by the anti-balaka to “ethnically cleanse” the Central African Republic of its Muslim population. These are crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Massacres are a disturbing, common feature of the crisis in the Central African Republic. Day after day, men, women and children have been killed with guns and machetes, some left to rot in the streets. Many of those horrors are documented in our latest briefing. 
Muslim areas are left empty as the population is forced to flee to neighbouring countries. 
The International peacekeeping troops have all too often been absent when and where they are needed most. Their deployment has not kept up with the pace of rapidly changing developments on the ground. And at times they have been reluctant to challenge anti-balaka militias, and slow to protect the threatened Muslim minority.	The international peacekeeping force must break the control of anti-balaka militias and station sufficient and well-supported troops in towns and villages where Muslims are threatened.

By any account the evening had already been a great success. Upwards of 100 people braved the elements on a chilly Friday night to fill all of the available seats for Weaving Hope, a night in support of Indigenous people in Colombia. Many were attending their first Amnesty event, and enthusiastically joined in the many creative actions. Painted hand prints were made, photos of solidarity were taken, and petitions were signed. The audience listened attentively to the poetry of Ojibway writer Art Solomon and shared in the smudging and blessing ceremony conducted by Clayton Shirt.  
,  
And they kept arriving in groups of two and three as Ruben Esguerra performed his unique brand of Latin American music mixed with a healthy dose of hip hop. By the time Quique Escamilla performed his soulful set inspired by his home state of Chiapas, Mexico, extra chairs were needed to fill the nooks and crannies of the Steelworkers Union Hall.  Yes, the music, poetry, and large crowd made it a thumbs up evening all around. 
,  
But the night wasn’t over, not by a long shot. Maria Patricia Tobon Yagari, an indigenous lawyer and Embera speaker from Colombia, stood up to address the audience.  She spoke through an interpreter and was visibly exhausted from four whirlwind days of meetings in Ottawa. Though choked with emotion, she slowly yet powerfully proceeded to describe the plight of her people.  And when she finished, she looked out to the crowd, and with a wry and slightly devilish smile, did something she admitted she had never done before in her life, at least not in the shower. She sang for us. 
,  
In her native tongue and in a few short verses she sang of her people, her home, and all that it means to her. She sang of so much that has already been lost, and her hope of what still might be saved. And when she finished, Federico Guzman, the speaker scheduled to conclude the evening, was so moved that he did something just as remarkable. He asked not to speak. Guzman, a celebrated jurist and human rights champion in his own right, bowed out because he believed nothing he could add would have nearly as much impact as what we had just heard.  
,  
As they packed up to leave, Maria Patricia beamed with delight at the beautiful mural she was given in solidarity with all of us in Canada, and Federico thanked  the volunteers and staff of Amnesty for “helping  immensely with their struggle in Colombia, and for making the invisible, visible. ”

When Khalil, 26, entered Lebanon having escaped the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria, he thought his life would finally improve. 
,  
But one night, he was lured into a meeting with two men. He says they raped him, stole money from his wallet and his mobile phone. 
,  
Khalil never reported the alleged rape to the police. He is a refugee, and he is also gay. He feared he would be penalized, and that no one would care about what had happened to him. 
,  
Since then, he has tried to commit suicide – a friend found him and took him to hospital. 
,  
Although Lebanon is often perceived as more tolerant than most countries in the region, like in Syria the Lebanese Penal Code considers ‘homosexual acts’ illegal. The country’s lesbian gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI) community is growing in prominence but the issue is still a taboo. 
,  
As one of the nearly one million refugees from Syria in Lebanon, Khalil claims to suffer daily discrimination on the basis of his nationality. But as a gay man he faces further hardship. 
,  
The majority of refugees from Syria in Lebanon register with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in order to access support. I learnt that many gay men do not disclose their sexual identity when registering with the UN as refugees for fear of the added stigma this would expose them to. 
,  
Those who have registered say UNHCR’s service providers have often cast doubt over whether they are gay before providing them with assistance, and are not sensitive to their needs. 
,  
Most say they haven’t been able to find the safety and security they were seeking outside of Syria. 
,  
Omar, 34, moved to Lebanon in November 2012 from Syria where he feared that Islamist militants who had taken over his city would persecute him for being gay. However, he is still struggling to feel safe. 
,  
“In general I am not feeling safe or stable. It’s worse because I am not only gay but I am Syrian as well. There is double discrimination,” he said. 
,  
Once in Lebanon, most refugees from Syria struggle with the high cost of living and the lack of support available. 
,  
Because of the financial hardship and difficulty they can encounter accessing services, refugees are increasingly reliant on the help of others. This can leave them at risk of ending up in abusive relationships because they have nowhere else to go. 
,  
Hamid, 26, moved to Lebanon in 2011 and initially lived with a Lebanese boyfriend who he says abused him. He said he was beaten and made to have sex with the man’s friends. 
,  
“He hurt me physically a lot. He broke my leg and hit my ear – I can’t hear properly. I never left the house because I had nowhere to go. I tolerated being beaten…He threatened that unless I had sex with guests he would kick me out of the house,” he said. 
,  
In November 2013, Hamid ran away and slept on the beach for two nights before registering with UNHCR. He suffers from Hepatitis B, a virus that affects the liver, and has informed UNHCR about his illness. 
,  
The costs of treatment for chronic disease like Hepatitis B are very high and not covered by the UN or by the Lebanese healthcare system. 
,  
Hamid was able to get tested to confirm his illness, but the treatment costs $3,000 USD per month in Lebanon and he does not have the funds. He is unable to work and is worried that if he falls sick no one will be there to care of him. 
,  
With no further support provided, or prospect of receiving medical assistance, Hamid is so desperate he is even considering going back to live with the man who beat him. 
,  
Khalil, Omar and Hamid all said they hope they will ultimately be resettled in a country where they will not be afraid to openly admit that they are gay, and are able to have access to medical services and the right to work. 
,  
Until then, they will continue to try to survive in Lebanon as best they can.

All names have been changed to protect the individual’s identities.

Khalil, Omar and Hamid all said they hope they will ultimately be resettled in a country where they will not be afraid to openly admit that they are gay, and are able to have access to medical services and the right to work. 
Until then, they will continue to try to survive in Lebanon as best they can. 
All names have been changed to protect the individual’s identities.

One night. One movement. There’s nothing like a stadium full of activists, human rights defenders, former prisoners of conscience, and musicians coming together to Bring Human Rights Home. 
Imagine Dragons rocked the house. An amazing performance and heartfelt and humbling call to keep our eyes and hearts open to human rights. 
Imagine Dragons performs at the Bringing Human Rights Home Concert 
Ms. Lauryn Hill rallied the crowd, keeping us all focused on “Working Hard” for human rights.

At a café in Sochi, 17-year-old “Ivan” quietly talks about his experiences as an openly gay young man in the Olympic city. A city in which there are no gay people, according to the Mayor. 
Ivan has a disturbing story to tell. After someone hacked his social media account about a year ago, news quickly spread about his sexual orientation. 
When he changed schools, the information about his sexuality again spread like wildfire among his new schoolmates. Now, a regular day at school includes being spat on and verbally abused, he tells us. He’s been physically attacked several times and some unknown attackers poured dirty water and urine on him. One time they went as far as attempting to rape him. His voice breaks as he recounts his almost daily ordeal. 
It’s a chilling story to listen to. Especially knowing that for Ivan, like many other lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people in Russia, it’s pointless to seek help and support from teachers or to file a complaint with the police about harassment and violent attacks. In Ivan’s case, when he did try to complain, the school administration simply told him to delete his page on social networks, as if it could remedy the situation. They also questioned his certainty about his own sexual orientation – instead of challenging the other students’ homophobic attitudes. 
But even if they wanted to challenge these attitudes, might it be interpreted as violating the law which bans “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations”? Perhaps… 
After the introduction of the law last year, Ivan has noticed constantly growing hostility towards gay people, and feels that they are now a new target for others’ hatred. 
Ivan is worried about what’s going to happen after the Olympic flame peters out. “I think the Olympics are the only thing that’s stopping them for now…I’m afraid the future will be a nightmare,” he says. 
Ivan’s fear of a backlash in the aftermath of the Olympics is not only a concern for the LGBTI community. Local journalist Nicolay Yarst also told Amnesty about possible retaliation against those criticizing the authorities ahead of and during the games. 
“When Sochi is over, things can really get worse,” he says. 
Nicolay knows what he’s talking about. He describes his own experience as a typical example of how Russian authorities clamp down on freedom of speech. 
Soon after he wrote a news story in May last year about corruption and injustice in Sochi, the authorities made sure he was no longer able to do his job. 
He was arrested by police who claimed he had drugs in his car. His criminal case file has gone back and forth between the police investigator and the prosecutor’s office five times, but never made it to court because the “evidence” is so poor. But the authorities remain keen on prosecuting him. 
In the meantime, his bail conditions prevent him from leaving Sochi. As a journalist this seriously hampers his work. 
With the evidence against him falling apart, he is cautiously optimistic that the case will eventually be dropped. But there is no indication of when this may happen. In the meantime he is struggling to provide for himself and his family. “I’m sitting in my apartment, not knowing what to do. I’ve basically been shut off,” he says. 
Another effective method used by the Russian authorities is intimidation tactics against families of government critics. Nicolay’s wife and daughter had to move to another city, as he is afraid they might be targeted as well. His parents have already been visited by some officials, who alleged their son was possibly a paedophile, and Nicolay wants to avoid any further incidents involving his family members. Now he only gets to see his family occasionally. But he has to put their safety first. 
Framing journalists and civil society activists who shine a spotlight on the harsh reality of everyday life in Russia appears a well-known practice in the country. 
Nicolay knew what he was getting into when he decided to become a journalist, he says. “I am not broken, I will keep on working to bring forward stories about social inequality.”

The fate of a Bill which would further criminalize Uganda’s LGBTI community is in the hands of Uganda President Musevini. The text of the Bill has not been made public but it is expected to include harsh penalties for anyone engaging in same-sex sexual activity and significantly hamper the work of human rights defenders and public health professionals. 
The President can sign, veto, or return the Bill to Parliament with suggested amendments. He has 30 days to make a decision… and the 30 day countdown started on January 23rd. 
Uganda’s LGBTI community needs you to call on President Musevini to veto the Bill and protect the human rights of all Ugandans! 
SIGN our online actionWRITE a letter to President MuseviniSHOW YOUR SOLIDARITY with Uganda’s LGBTI community 
This note sent to Amnesty International in January 2014 by a Ugandan LGBTI activist shows just how much our solidarity means to activists in Uganda. 
“The solidarity cards were amazing. I cried for a while when I received them. When I suggested the solidarity cards for the lgbt community, I didn’t know the impact they would have. 
Its just really amazing to read personal messages of support from strangers who have never met you nor might never meet you telling you they understand your struggle, telling you that victory will come some day, that your work is not in vain..	We don’t always get that kind of support from friends and family.	This is a much needed show of solidarity to the Kuchu community in Uganda who now more than ever feel betrayed by leaders that are supposed to make laws to protect them. 
Public statements have great impact, but personal messages provide us as individuals with strength to keep you going . The timing couldn’t have been better. Thank you. Really, thank you.”

,  
	Beaten, burned, bruised, strangled bodies lying on a dirty floor. Some show signs of starvation, others are missing their eyes, a number of them appear to have been electrocuted. The horror is nearly impossible to describe… but it is hardly surprising. 
,  
	The thousands of photographs, part of a report published today, provide evidence of the torture and killing of around 11,000 individuals detained in Syria between the start of the uprising in 2011 and August last year. 
,  
	While we cannot authenticate the images, the allegations are consistent with aspects of Amnesty International’s own research into the widespread use of torture and enforced disappearance by the Syrian authorities, as well as deaths in custody. 
,  
The extensive experience and reputation of the international lawyers and forensic experts in charge of the investigation also contribute to its credibility. 
,  
	Inevitably, the utter horror illustrated by these images will cast a shadow over the peace talks that will take place in Geneva in the coming days. 
,  
	World leaders will probably condemn the abuses and express their dismay at the images. 
,  
	But the question is: what can be done to prevent another 11,000 people from being tortured to death? 
,  
	It is estimated that tens of thousands of people have been detained during the crisis. Among those still held are human rights activists, medics and humanitarian workers perceived to have been critical of the authorities. 
,  
	Some have been given lengthy prison sentences following unfair trials while others have been held without charge or trial in detention centres run by Syria’s multiple intelligence services. The whereabouts of many is, simply, unknown. 
,  
	What all have in common is the chilling possibility that they are suffering from the same abuse that is shocking the world today. 
,  
	Majd al-Din al-Kholani, 25, is one of those detainees. He has been held incommunicado since he was arrested in Daraya, a city south-west of Damascus, in 2011 when he gave Syrian soldiers water bottles with flowers to oppose the use of force against demonstrators. 
,  
	Recently Amnesty International received credible information that his case had been transferred to a field military court where he may face the death penalty or prolonged imprisonment. 
,  
	In a separate event in August 2013, at least 105 civilians, mainly women and children, were abducted from their mostly Alawite Muslim villages by an armed group that had hoped to swap them for opposition fighters held by the government. They continue to be held hostage. 
,  
	States taking part in the Geneva talks have a big responsibility on their hands. They must urge the Syrian authorities to release peaceful activists in detention, grant access to the Commission of Inquiry and other human rights bodies to investigate reported violations and monitor the treatment of detainees and to refer the situation in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. 
,  
	They must also use any influence they may have on armed opposition groups to ensure they release civilians and treat captured soldiers and others humanely. 
,  
	Anyone currently in the custody of the Syria goverment must be released unless they are charged with a recognizable crime. Trials must meet international standards. Anyone deprived of their liberty must be given immediate access to their family, lawyers and medical attention. 
,  
	The horrific photos released today should serve as proof of the need for human rights and justice to be put at the top of any agenda and discussions. 
,  
	Those participating in the peace talks in Geneva cannot stay silent. 
,  
	The evidence of crimes against humanity on a mass scale is staring them in the face. 
,  
	What more will it take to convince them to take effective action to stop such crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice? 
,

Many eyes were watching closely during this visit. There would have been no better time to show that Canada is a principled human rights champion. But that was not to be. 
There was considerable fanfare and red carpet during Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s trip to Israel this week. 
After nearly eight years in office, the prime minister visited the country with which he has forged closer links than almost any other. The spectacle was breathtaking, with a delegation of over 200 people, including six cabinet ministers and other government MPs. With that sort of political heft, the opportunity to press important issues was considerable.  
	How disappointing, though not surprising, that Israel’s numerous human rights shortcomings did not make that list. 
	Over eight years, the prime minister and his five foreign ministers have shown no appetite to press the Israeli government to improve its human rights record. In fact, in his speech to the Knesset he equated criticizing Israel with anti-Semitism; and declared critics only chastise Israel “to get along.” 
	There was no criticism of civilian casualties during armed conflict in Gaza in 2008-09 and 2012; nor has Canada raised concerns about the punishing Gaza blockade. And it would be generous to say that Canada has expressed mild concern about illegal Israeli settlements. 
	These days, Canada’s voting record at the UN says it all. When critique of Israel is on the table, Canada’s vote is “no.”  Not that UN politicking about Israel’s human rights record is without problems. It is polarizing and, very often, one-sided. But Canada waded through that more delicately in the past. Never so blatantly partisan. 
	And it is not to dismiss the very real insecurity Israel has faced for decades. Clearly the Israeli government must respond to those threats; but must do so in keeping with international law. 
	Many eyes were watching closely during this visit, within Israel, in Gaza and the West Bank, in the region, around the world and—of course—back in Canada. There would have been no better time to show that Canada is a principled human rights champion, prepared to urge a close ally to do better. But that was not to be; not for lack of concerns to highlight. 
	Beginning with dealing with the past. Gaza is a stark reminder. Enmity drags on. Violence is entrenched. Human rights violations repeat. All fueled by longstanding impunity that denies justice equally to victims of Israeli missiles and Palestinian rockets. Israel refused to co-operate with a UN investigation into the military operation in Gaza in 2008-09 and has not thoroughly investigated alleged violations during the November 2012 Gaza campaign. 
	Impunity for mass violations extends to individual cases. Israeli armed forces repeatedly use excessive force against Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank. There have been dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries over the past decade, often during protests against settlement expansion or the infamous wall. In these tragic cases, too, there is rarely any accountability.  Canada has championed strengthened justice for human rights violations worldwide and has the authority to press Israel on this. But that was not to be. 
	The prime minister declined to raise even mild concerns about Israeli settlement policy during the visit. A starting point to a more credible position would have been to call, while in the country, for an end to forced evictions and the demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, which facilitate expanding settlements. Not to be. 
	The visit also offered an opening to press for the agonizing Gaza blockade to be lifted. Gazans have lacked safe drinking water, can face 12-hour power outages daily and struggle to access adequate food and medicine. Attiyeh Abu Khousa, whose 13-year-old son was killed by a missile fired by an Israeli drone, told Amnesty International that “the blockade is as bad as the war; it’s like a slow death for everyone in Gaza.” That was not to be. 
	There was much more on the human rights front that the prime minister should have raised. Legislate an absolute ban on torture and investigate all allegations of torture. Release prisoners and repeal imprisonment on grounds of conscientious objection to military service. End administrative detention, under which over 130 prisoners are held without charge. Revoke orders which make peaceful protests by Palestinians illegal unless authorized by an Israeli commander. Pull back from proposed legislation that would lead to forced evictions of 30,000 Bedouin in the Naqab/Negev desert. 
	And repeal recent amendments to the ominously titled Prevention of Infiltration Law, allowing indefinite detention of refugees and asylum-seekers, many fleeing atrocities in countries like Eritrea and Sudan, in a remote desert prison. Prime Minister Harper might have reminded Israel of the leading role it once took in drafting the UN Refugee Convention. But none of that was to be. 
	More than anything, this would have been a tremendous opportunity for the prime minister to hear directly from the individuals and communities whose rights are on the line, be they Palestinians in the occupied territories, inhabitants of unrecognized Bedouin villages or refugees in a desert prison. 
	This trip was a long time coming. The need for a clear indication that Canada wants a friend to improve its human rights record has also been a long time coming.  But that was not to be.

In the small town of Boali, 100km north of the capital Bangui, the Muslim neighbourhoods are eerily silent, completely empty of their inhabitants. Every single home has been thoroughly looted. Even the front doors have been removed and carted away. 
,  
Most of the Muslim residents have fled the town, forcibly displaced by vicious attacks carried out by so-called anti-balaka militias. We found more than 800 people who have not yet managed to leave. They are sheltering in the local church, where an impressive young priest is leading by example of inter-faith and neighbourly solidarity.One young man told us about an anti-balaka attack in Boali on Friday 17 January which left five dead and 20 injured. He recounted how, at around mid-day young men armed with machetes burst into the family home. 
,  
“Everything happened very quickly. They did not say anything; they just started to hit us with machetes. They struck my father, Sanu, 55, repeatedly and smashed his head, killing him on the spot, and they injured my mother, Fatimatu, 40, and her younger sister Aichatu, who died of her injuries earlier today (19 Jan) before she could reach hospital. She had very serious head injuries; she left an eight-month-old baby girl, Ramatu, who is now an orphan.” 
,  
Today, we found baby Ramatu, 11-year-old Fati and several other victims of this attack in a hospital in the capital to where they were taken by a humanitarian organization. Ramatu luckily got away with a minor injury to the forehead but Fati has a nasty open wound on the top of her head and another on her arm. She told us that the young men who stormed her home struck her with machetes.

,  
For now the terrified Muslim residents are afforded some safety by French and African Union (AU) peacekeepers who are keeping the church cordoned off, but they want to leave and don’t know how. 
,  
A French officer told us that the road between Boali and the capital is extremely dangerous for Muslims because of the checkpoints manned by anti-balaka militias. 
,  
We passed through two of these checkpoints on the way to and from Boali (one a few kilometres north of Bangui and the other a few kilometres south of Boali). Both times the young anti-balaka militia members demanded money to let us pass. 
,  
Other displaced residents who have braved the checkpoints to seek refuge in the capital tell similar stories.

We found a young man called Dairu sitting on a mat, his injured leg wrapped in a filthy rag, in the middle of an extremely crowded field near a mosque in the “PK 12” neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of the capital. It is here where thousands of displaced Muslim families fleeing anti-balaka attacks further north are congregating. 
,  
He told us how his father and 12 other relatives, including a six-month-old baby girl, were brutally killed by anti-balaka militias last week in Bouyali (some 130Km north of Bangui): 
,  
“My father, Soba Tibati, could hardly walk because of bad rheumatism and could not run away when the anti-balaka attacked our village last Wednesday. They decapitated him in front of my eyes as he sat on a straw mat under a tree outside our hut. Twelve other members of my family were also massacred in the same attack: among them were three of my father’s brothers, four sons of one of my uncles, my aunt, and three of my little cousins, the youngest a baby girl who was just six months old”. 
,  
Tibati’s son was himself shot in the left thigh while running away. Five days later he has still not been able to get any treatment. 
,  
The displaced keep streaming in, some carrying their possessions and even furniture, others with only clothes on their backs. Some hope to find temporary respite from the attacks in parts of the capital but others told us they are leaving the country to seek refuge in neighbouring countries because it has become too dangerous for Muslims in CAR and no one is protecting them. Either way, it seems unlikely that they will be able to return home any time soon. 
,  
Muslim communities are being blamed wholesale for the widespread atrocities committed over the past 10 months by ex-Seleka forces, the predominantly Muslim forces which were in power until earlier this month. 
,  
If nothing is done to rein in the anti-balaka militias, there is a real danger that many members of the Muslim minority may be forced to embark on what may end up being a one-way journey out of the country.

Every single home has been thoroughly looted. Even the front doors have been removed and carted away. 
Most of the Muslim residents have fled the town, forcibly displaced by vicious attacks carried out by so-called anti-balaka militias. We found more than 800 people who have not yet managed to leave. They are sheltering in the local church, where an impressive young priest is leading by example of inter-faith and neighbourly solidarity.One young man told us about an anti-balaka attack in Boali on Friday 17 January which left five dead and 20 injured. He recounted how, at around mid-day young men armed with machetes burst into the family home. 
“Everything happened very quickly. They did not say anything; they just started to hit us with machetes. They struck my father, Sanu, 55, repeatedly and smashed his head, killing him on the spot, and they injured my mother, Fatimatu, 40, and her younger sister Aichatu, who died of her injuries earlier today (19 Jan) before she could reach hospital. She had very serious head injuries; she left an eight-month-old baby girl, Ramatu, who is now an orphan.” 
Today, we found baby Ramatu, 11-year-old Fati and several other victims of this attack in a hospital in the capital to where they were taken by a humanitarian organization. Ramatu luckily got away with a minor injury to the forehead but Fati has a nasty open wound on the top of her head and another on her arm. She told us that the young men who stormed her home struck her with machetes.

For now the terrified Muslim residents are afforded some safety by French and African Union (AU) peacekeepers who are keeping the church cordoned off, but they want to leave and don’t know how. 
A French officer told us that the road between Boali and the capital is extremely dangerous for Muslims because of the checkpoints manned by anti-balaka militias. 
We passed through two of these checkpoints on the way to and from Boali (one a few kilometres north of Bangui and the other a few kilometres south of Boali). Both times the young anti-balaka militia members demanded money to let us pass. 
Other displaced residents who have braved the checkpoints to seek refuge in the capital tell similar stories.

Jean-Claude Roger Mbede died an untimely death on 10 January in his hometown, Ngoumou, Cameroon. 
,  
According to media reports, his family prevented him from receiving necessary medical treatment – leaving him fighting for his life whilst his lawyers fought in the courts to appeal his earlier conviction for “homosexuality”. 
,  
Human rights activists around the world were shocked and saddened by the news of Jean-Claude’s death. Amnesty International had been campaigning on his behalf for several years and previously named him a prisoner of conscience. During this time, the 34-year-old activist with a broad smile befriended many people at the organization. 
,  
Jean-Claude was one of many individuals who have been arrested and convicted in Cameroon under laws criminalizing sex between people of the same sex. He was arrested in March 2011 after sending a text to a man saying that he was in love with him. 
,  
Later convicted of “homosexuality and attempted homosexuality”, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. During his time in jail, he suffered from malnutrition and regular beatings. Although he was granted a provisional release on 16 July 2012 while his lawyer was appealing his case, the Yaoundé Court of Appeal then upheld his sentence. Fearing re-arrest and being forced to serve out the remainder of his sentence, Jean-Claude went into hiding. 
,  
Despite the ongoing legal appeal and international activism on his behalf, Jean-Claude sadly went to his grave as an outlaw, whose only “crime” was expressing his love. 
,  
 
,  
,  
The Cameroonian authorities’ harsh treatment of LGBTI individuals like Jean-Claude, and his society’s callous indifference to their suffering – and even death – are indicative of a wider, and growing, problem in many African countries today. 
,  
Sex between adults of the same sex – often characterized as “unnatural carnal acts” or “acts against the order of nature” – is currently a crime in 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as all of North Africa. In four countries in the region, it carries the death penalty. 
,  
Last June, Amnesty International released a report about the rising levels of homophobia in the region. Making Love a Crime: Criminalization of same-sex conduct in sub-Saharan Africa looks at how “homosexual acts” are being increasingly criminalized across Africa as a number of governments seek to impose increased penalties or broaden the scope of existing laws, including by introducing the death penalty. 
,  
Besides Jean-Claude’s tragic death, recent developments in other countries have shown how the situation has worsened since then. 
,  
,  
On Monday, LGBTI activists in Nigeria had their worst fears confirmed after the draconian Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act was signed into law. While Nigerian law already criminalized “carnal knowledge against the order of nature” with a punishment of up to 14 years’ imprisonment, and some northern states providing for the death penalty under Shari’a law, the deeply oppressive new law runs roughshod over the most basic freedoms. 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
With the stroke of a pen, President Goodluck Jonathan enacted legislation that not only criminalized ‘same-sex marriage’ – so widely defined as to include virtually any form of same-sex cohabitation – but criminalized the activities of many human rights and civil society organizations and entities. According to the Bill, anyone who “supports the registration, operation and sustenance of gay clubs, societies, organizations, processions or meetings” could face 10 years in prison. 
,  
This essentially turned Nigeria into one of the world’s least-tolerant societies. 
,  
On Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, blasted the law in a statement: “Rarely have I seen a piece of legislation that in so few paragraphs directly violates so many basic, universal human rights. Rights to privacy and non-discrimination, rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, rights to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention: this law undermines all of them.” 
,  
Since it came into effect, police in several Nigerian states have made scores of arrests under the law and at least 12 people are reportedly still in detention. Human rights defenders have told Amnesty International that the police in at least one state have drawn up a list of 167 people targeted for arrest based on their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTI activists say that many of those currently in detention are being denied access to lawyers and other assistance. 
,  
The organization is calling for this witch-hunt to end and for Nigerian authorities to repeal the discriminatory law. 
,  
,  
Meanwhile in Uganda, LGBTI individuals and human rights activists continue to campaign against the country’s repressive Anti-Homosexuality Bill. On 20 December 2013, the Bill – first proposed in 2009 – was passed by Parliament in a surprise vote. 
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
,  
The full text of the Bill as passed has not yet been released; nonetheless, the passage amounts to a grave assault on human rights – dramatically increasing criminal penalties for consensual sexual activity between adults of the same sex. Like its counterpart in Nigeria, in addition to violating rights to privacy, family life and equality, the bill threatens freedom of association and expression – all of which are protected under Ugandan and international human rights law. 
,  
Other disturbing provisions of the draft Bill included criminalizing the “promotion” of homosexuality, compelling HIV testing in some circumstances, and imposing life sentences for “aggravated homosexuality” or entering into a same-sex marriage. 
,  
The knock-on effect of passing this Bill will reach far beyond LGBTI people in Uganda, impeding the legitimate work of civil society, public health professionals, and community leaders. 
,  
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has the power to put an end to this wildly discriminatory legislation. Amnesty International is carrying out a global campaign to urge him to veto the Bill in its entirety and reaffirm Uganda’s commitment to upholding human rights. 
,  
,  
Though not directly linked, these recent developments in Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda highlight the situation facing LGBTI people and activists in many parts of Africa today. 
,  
Yet across the continent, a large and growing number of activists and organizations continue to challenge these laws and to fight for the human rights of LGBTI people. 
,  
Amnesty International continues to join with them to fight to make sure that no one faces harassment, prison, or even death, just because of who they are and who they love.

It was a disaster on an almost unprecedented scale. And, for a country already wracked by poverty with so many institutional weaknesses, it was a complete catastrophe. 
When I visited Haiti two months after the earthquake, my worst fears were confirmed. The Haitian authorities were completely overwhelmed, with most of the country’s government buildings having collapsed and countless public officials dead. The blank stare of then Haitian President René Préval was one of the most telling symbols of a country stood on the precipice of an abyss. 
Unsurprisingly, in the aftermath of the earthquake, Haiti was headline news across the globe. Yet four years on, with the cameras gone, the problems and suffering of the people remain.

,  
The Northern Gateway Project is intended to transport heavy oil sands crude and industrial chemicals between Alberta and the British Columbia coast. 
,  
The majority of First Nations whose traditional lands would be crossed by the proposed pipeline have opposed the project, as have First Nations who depend on the downstream rivers and coastal waters.  
, 	In a  report released on December 19, the Joint Review Panel established to carry out an environmental impact assessment recommends that the project be approved subject to 209 conditions, many of which include requirements for further consultation with First Nations. 
,  
However, if such “consultation” is based on the premise that the project will proceed regardless, it will not meet the standard of human rights protection required by Canadian and international law. 
, 	The Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly stated that there is a mandatory minimum legal duty for governments to carry out meaningful, good faith consultations with Indigenous peoples prior to any decision with the potential to affect their rights. Canadian courts have also been clear that the purpose of such consultation is to “substantially” accommodate Indigenous interests. 
,  
This requires decision-makers to be prepared to abandon proposals where significant concerns cannot be addressed. Furthermore, where there is potential for serious harm to Indigenous rights, the Courts have said that projects may require the consent of the affected Indigenous peoples. 
,  
These requirements of Canadian law are bolstered by international human rights standards that require the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples for any project with the potential to cause significant harm to their rights. 
,  
Amnesty International has taken the position that — given the scale of the project, and the potential for serious impacts on Indigenous peoples’ use of the land — the proposed Northern Gateway Project must not be approved over the objection of First Nations. 
,  
While the report of the Northern Gateway Review acknowledged that the issue of consent was raised by First Nations, the Review Panel never addresses this issue. 
,  
The decision on whether the Northern Gateway project should proceed is now in the hands of the federal Cabinet. Unfortunately, the Joint Review Panel report has provided little guidance on the legal framework of rights and obligations on which this decision must be based.

The Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly stated that there is a mandatory minimum legal duty for governments to carry out meaningful, good faith consultations with Indigenous peoples prior to any decision with the potential to affect their rights. Canadian courts have also been clear that the purpose of such consultation is to “substantially” accommodate Indigenous interests. 
This requires decision-makers to be prepared to abandon proposals where significant concerns cannot be addressed. Furthermore, where there is potential for serious harm to Indigenous rights, the Courts have said that projects may require the consent of the affected Indigenous peoples. 
These requirements of Canadian law are bolstered by international human rights standards that require the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples for any project with the potential to cause significant harm to their rights. 
Amnesty International has taken the position that — given the scale of the project, and the potential for serious impacts on Indigenous peoples’ use of the land — the proposed Northern Gateway Project must not be approved over the objection of First Nations. 
While the report of the Northern Gateway Review acknowledged that the issue of consent was raised by First Nations, the Review Panel never addresses this issue. 
The decision on whether the Northern Gateway project should proceed is now in the hands of the federal Cabinet. Unfortunately, the Joint Review Panel report has provided little guidance on the legal framework of rights and obligations on which this decision must be based.

	Her voice began to choke and then the tears began to flow down her face as she calmly and steadily recounted the long list of names of all the women and children killed in her village when the anti-balaka struck a week ago. 
,  
	Sitting in a darkened hospital ward at the Hôpital Communautaire, she gracefully removed her headscarf and revealed the stitches laced across her scalp where the machete had struck. Alongside her was her four-year-old daughter with a matching wound on her head, also the victim of machete attacks. 
,  
	Nearly everyone in her village near Bangui, the Central African Republic’s capital city, had been wiped out in these early strikes by the anti-balaka militia who unleashed the carnage that has since been wrought on Bangui.   
,  
	We met her one week after she had suffered those attacks and she told us what happened in her village with amazing calm and dignity. In her ward were numerous women also recovering from the various machete and bullet wounds inflicted by unknown attackers in the violence that has run riot across Bangui and the nearby villages. 
,  
	At a nearby mosque, in a small, crowded side street in an area mostly populated by Muslims – known as PK5 – we watched as 16 bodies were removed from a truck and taken for burial. Wrapped in white plastic sheeting, the bodies had attracted a huge crowd, angry about how these people had died and eager to tell us what had happened.

 Civilian victims of revenge killings

Most of the dead were reportedly civilians and we heard gruesome stories about how they had reportedly been the victims of brutal revenge attacks.

	People told me that some had been decapitated by their attackers; some with their ears cut off; others slashed down the centre of their bodies and disembowelled. We didn’t see the bodies but we are obtaining photos to confirm these reports.

Across the road from the mosque we were introduced to a group of around 50 women and children from the Boeing quartier – all of whom had lost their husbands and fathers in different attacks.

	It is not hard to find tales of misery in Bangui today. You need only travel to the airport where the sprawling camp for displaced people is growing by the day. 
,  
	People have arrived in their thousands, believing the airport to be a safe haven because of the proximity of French troops. Men, women and children have all taken up residence, with groundsheets of various colours and textures spread everywhere, providing scant protection from the hard, dusty ground below. A few tents have been erected but most are without any kind of shelter from the sun or the rain. Some have found protection from the elements amongst those crowded into a hangar for old aircraft or beneath the wings of old planes parked nearby. 
,  
It’s as if the camp has been there for weeks of months, not the few days in which it has sprung up, attracting an estimated more than 15,000 people from around Bangui, increasing to more than 40,000 at night. The spirit of enterprise is alive and well, with stalls set up everywhere selling everything from tinned food, soap, flour and cooked meals to medicines or battery power to charge mobile phones. One stall even had a selection of women’s earrings on sale, proving there is still space for vanity in the midst of the greatest hardship. 
,  
 As you pick your way through the crowds, children still reach out to shake your hand or delight in seeing their image portrayed on your small digital camera screen. “Ça va?” people ask as you pass, “How are you?” and reply with a smile as they tell you “Ça va bien” – “All is well” –  not complaining about the shocking conditions they find themselves in.

	One of the most depressing aspects of the ongoing violence in the Central African Republic is its symmetry.

	Christian and Muslim militia alike are carrying out equally vicious attacks. And members of both communities, while denouncing each other’s crimes, will tell you that their own people are acting in self defence. 
,  
	With each new outrage, the pattern of tit-for-tat atrocities becomes harder to break. 
,  
The day before yesterday I interviewed a Christian man who recounted how he was nearly killed in a raid last week on the outskirts of Bangui, the country’s capital. Shot in the side at close range, he survived by playing dead; he claims that others from his neighbourhood were not as lucky. 
,  
	“It was the Peuhls,” he said, referring to an ethnic group of nomadic Muslim herders. “They were armed with Kalashnikovs.” 
,  
	An electrician by trade, the man had gotten up early that morning to get ready for work. Grimacing in pain as he showed me his heavily bandaged back, he said that when he stepped out into his yard he was ambushed by a group of four local Peuhls whom he knew by sight. “I was sure I was dead,” he said, still seemingly amazed that he wasn’t. 
,  
	He told me that the attack occurred just off the road leading to Boali, a town some 90 kilometres north of Bangui. I heard the name Boali again the following day, this time from a group of Peuhl women whose village, located a few kilometres from the town, had been set upon by the Christian militia known as “anti-balaka,” or anti-machete. 
,  
	More than a dozen villagers were reportedly killed in the attack, which was carried out just a few days before the larger explosion of violence in Bangui last Thursday. Adults were not the only ones targeted: 10 children were injured, some by gunfire and some by machete. One of the cruel ironies of this conflict is that a group that calls itself anti-machete is even willing to use that weapon on the young. 
,  
	It has taken less than a year for sectarian passions to become so enflamed. Mostly Muslim rebels known as the Seleka overthrew the government of this majority Christian country last March. At the time of the coup, sectarian motivations were not very apparent; what drove the conflict was the usual desire for power and control over natural resources. 
,  
 From bad to worse  
,  
How did a bad situation become worse, and then much, much worse? When did hatred of the Seleka degenerate into – for many of the country’s Christians – anger at all Muslims? 
,  
A visit to any hospital in Bangui shows where this path leads. But there, at least, among the badly wounded Muslim and Christian patients crowding the wards, are reminders of another, more hopeful way: local doctors and nurses who are providing desperately needed medical care to members of both communities. To them, an injured child is an injured child, not an enemy. 
,  
	The choice between these two paths rests, for now, with the international community. Unless international peacekeeping forces urgently restore security the sectarian bloodshed will continue. The international community can also help by ensuring that atrocities are independently and impartially investigated, so that individual perpetrators – not entire communities – are held accountable for their crimes. 
,  
	In the longer term, Christians and Muslims in the Central African Republic will need to reconcile. For now they just need to stop killing each other

	There is hatred in their eyes as they spit their words out at you: “Djotodia doit partir”, Michel Djotodia, transitional President of the Central African Republic, “must go”. 
	These same words were emblazoned in graffiti on walls around a small unremarkable mosque near the Assemblée Nationale, on the Avenue de l’Independence – one of Bangui’s principal roads that is heavily patrolled by the French, African (members of the Multinational Force for Central Africa – FOMAC) and ex-Seleka troops, where a revenge mob had gathered. 
	They had burned the mosque, as well as the Imam’s house. And they were running riot, removing anything that could be taken from the building. 
	They pulled the corrugated iron from the roof and fled with their trophies into the neighbouring quarter of Fouh. 
Others, men and women together, gathered in the dusty grounds, shouting encouragement to the mob, beating at the walls with whatever instruments they could find or writing their graffiti in large letters on the remaining walls, declaring their hatred of the president. 
 Even worse were those writing “Tuer les musulmans” – “Kill the Muslims” – on the wall of the already-defiled mosque. 
	Members of the mob revelled in any attention they could get, happily performing for the few cameras that had braved the crowd and the ongoing insecurity to record what was going on.	  
Violence linked to escalation of anti-Muslim rhetoric  
	To any sane observer, it was an utterly meaningless attack. But this is what’s growing in Bangui today, fuelled by what feels like a shocking escalation of anti-Muslim rhetoric within the Christian community. 
	Language that would, in normal times, be unthinkable is being used to describe their fellow man – neighbours rising against neighbours – all on the basis of religion. 
	People in Bangui are angry and frustrated. This is a city where normal life has come to a complete halt. The ramshackle stores and restaurants that line the sides of the city’s roads are all deserted or, even worse, looted or destroyed. Small numbers of people can be seen wandering aimlessly in groups. 
	But most are in hiding, having either joined the masses taking refuge in the various camps that have sprung up around the city or staying in their homes with the doors firmly locked, unable to go out even to buy food. 
	All shops and small businesses are closed. No one is going to work or to school. Only a few hospitals remain open but without the daily stream of the sick and unwell who would normally arrive seeking treatment. 
	Anger and resentment are growing day after day. People want revenge and are not willing to sit back and wait for the French troops or for the Multinational Force of Central Africa (FOMAC) forces to protect them. 
	Unspeakable acts of inhumanity are being carried out on a daily basis in the Central African Republic. 
 Children targeted  
	We have seen children who were brutally attacked, by men wielding machetes. These were not random attacks: the children were hit directly in the head. 
	We have spoken to people who feel safer in the squalid conditions of displaced peoples’ camps than in the safety of their own homes. 
“I was born here. My father was born here. So was my grandfather. How can they tell me I am not Central African?” more than one person has said this to me. 
	And yet Muslims in Bangui have become the focus of much of the rage that is sweeping the city, declared as outsiders by the predominantly Christian community. 
	When we visited the central morgue in the city, we were told that all of the hundreds of bodies stored there were Christians. 
	“How do you know?” we asked. “Because they don’t have dark marks on their foreheads,” some told us, a reference to marks some are said to develop as a result of the Muslim act of prayer. 
	The majority of those killed in Bangui since last Wednesday may have been Christians but the way the tide is turning against the Muslim community is deeply worrying. 
 Revenge attacks 
	We are hearing increased reports of disturbing revenge attacks against Muslims around Bangui. One man was killed when he returned to his home in a mostly Christian neighbourhood to collect some personal belongings. 
	It is not unreasonable to fear what will happen next in the Central African Republic. Stability, state authority and rule of law urgently need to be re-established. 
	Peace needs to prevail and the killing must stop. But then comes the much bigger challenge of re-building trust between communities torn apart by the bloodshed and brutality.

There are no easy answers to these questions but this is the reality in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic today. Conditions are desperate. And people are very afraid. 
Four days after an armed group launched a flash attack on Bangui, more than 60,000 people have taken refuge in various locations around the city. Many have fled to churches; similar reports are being received from mosques – though on a smaller scale. But the largest number has taken refuge around the airport, which is known to be secure because of the presence of French forces. 
These people are fleeing their homes out of fear. Reports are still being received of armed groups threatening, killing and pillaging different residential areas. Neighbors who say they once lived peacefully together are now in fear of each other, virtually at war, casting aspersions on others only on the basis of their religion. 
They could easily go home. They have not come far. But this is unlikely to happen until they feel a real sense of security. In the meantime, reports are being received of women giving birth in camps in the open air with no medical aid while sick children are also suffering. 
Médecins sans Frontières – and other NGOs – are doing an amazing job, providing treatment in the hospitals and in the camps. But this long-running crisis has escalated so dramatically since the outbreak of violence overnight on December 4-5 that no one is equipped to handle what is happening right now. 
The arrival of new French troops has given a small sense of protection, even more so now that they can be seen patrolling on foot. The Multinational Force of Central Africa (FOMAC) forces, too, provide much-needed protection, but there is widespread mistrust for their Chadian contingent, perceived as sympathetic to some abusive ex-Seleka forces. 
Everyone in this small city has either lost a relative or knows someone who has died in these few short days of violence. And this mirrors what has already happened across the entire country where entire villages have been wiped out. 
While re-establishing law and order across the city is the most urgent priority, this is not enough to address the much-deeper roots of this crisis. Justice must be delivered to the people of the Central African Republic if it is ever to heal itself and people are to live in peace with each other again.

– by Alex Neve	Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada	  
One thing so powerful and important about Amnesty International’s work is that we strive to make a difference in the lives of individuals and communities facing human rights violations; while also campaigning for global change that will protect rights and prevent violations from happening in the first place. 
	This year has been such a compelling reminder that working at both of those levels is so pressing and necessary.  And on each of those fronts – standing with individuals and tackling global problems – we have seen moments of great triumph; and of deep despair.	  
I have been involved in two front line missions this year focused on responding to two different human rights crises in Sudan.  And the triumph and despair faced by individuals and communities was so apparent. 
In January, as part of a mission to the volatile frontier between Sudan and South Sudan and across the border into Sudan’s troubled Southern Kordofan state, I met recently released prisoner of conscience Dr. Bushra Gama, who had been imprisoned by Sudanese authorities because of his efforts to draw attention to human rights violations in Southern Kordofan.    Amnesty International had taken up his case, as it was clear he was a prisoner of conscience.  And now he is out; and safe.    
 “While in prison I learned that Amnesty International had taken up my case and right away I knew that I would not be killed.”• Dr. Bushra Gamar, released prisoner of conscience, Southern Kordofan, Sudan 
	It was beyond inspiring to hear his certainty that he owed his freedom to Amnesty International and was determined to continue with his important human rights work.  Triumph. 
	In November I was in remote corners of eastern Chad, interviewing refugees who have streamed across the Sudan/Chad border escaping a very worrying surge in violence and human rights violations in Darfur.  That is where I met 10 year old Khadija, who talked of the loss of her father, her family’s escape into Chad and her sense of fear; all in a quiet, sorrowful voice.  Despair. 
	But even with Khadija I was able to talk to her about the fact that there were people all around the world who would do everything possible to take away her fear and make it possible for her family to one day return home in safety.  And I saw the beginning of a smile, particularly in her eyes. 
“My father was shot and killed during the attack.  We all ran away.  I have never been so afraid in my life.  In the past it was my father who made me feel okay when I was afraid, but he couldn’t do that this time.”	• Khadija, 10 year old refugee from Darfur, Sudan 
Our work globally this year has also seen both despair and triumph.  What could be more despairing than to watch the wrenching crisis in Syria deepen?  The numbers killed mount.  The numbers displaced within Syria mount.  The numbers who have fled across the border as refugees mount.  The number of children killed and traumatized by the conflict mount.  And the world seems paralyzed and unable to bring this unimaginable crisis to an end.  Through our research we continue to bring the nature and scope of the atrocities to the world’s attention.  
	Through our campaigning we continue to press governments to take the steps necessary to end this tragedy.  We will continue; we must.	  
But what triumph in April!  After years of unrelenting research and campaigning, Amnesty International celebrated the UN’s adoption of a global Arms Trade Treaty.  The treaty will, at long last, bring sorely-needed human rights rules to the deadly trade in arms that fuels human rights violations in every corner of the world; including Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Syria.  When we first pressed governments to take this step, years ago, we were told that it was naïve and unrealistic to imagine that states would ever agree to limit their trade in weapons.  But once again perseverance and determination have won the day. 
Not that we close that file by any means.  For now we must encourage states to first sign and then legally ratify the new treaty.  Over 100 states have taken that first step, which is largely symbolic, including the United States.  But Canada has not yet done either. 
	There have been many sweet moments of triumph to savour this year when it comes to our work with individuals.	  
What joy to welcome Canadian citizen Hamid Ghassemi-Shall back to Canada after more than 5 years of wrongful imprisonment in Iran, much of that time spent in solitary confinement and under a sentence of death.  Over the years we have worked closely with his wife Antonella Mega in her tireless campaign to save his life and win his freedom.  We embraced her stirring mantra of ‘I’m not giving up’; and we will take that same spirit with us as we continue with effort s to free other prisoners in Iran and elsewhere and to stave off executions in the ever smaller number of countries that hang on to the death penalty.  Among others it certainly will inspire our campaigning on behalf of Canadian citizens Huseyin Celil and Bashir Makhtal, serving life sentences in China and Ethiopia; and Ron Smith, on death row in Montana.	  
Other prisoners of conscience whose cases were taken up by Amnesty International were freed this year as well.  In August Chinese human rights activist Shi Tao was released, 15 months before the end of his ten year sentence.  He had been convicted after Yahoo provided Chinese authorities access to his email account.  In September courageous Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was freed, and wasted no time in reminding the world that there is still much to be done in the effort to protect human rights in Iran.  
  
Our global efforts have continued on many fronts.  We have made it a priority to draw attention to the terrible crisis faced by Indigenous peoples in Colombia, where 1/3 of the country’s Indigenous nations face physical or cultural extermination.  Canada has an ever closer relationship with Colombia, including through a new trade deal, and we are increasingly concerned that Canada is not doing all we can and should to stand up for the rights of Indigenous peoples in that context. 
• The ups and downs of change and turmoil in Egypt.	• The attention brought to Sri Lanka’s grim human rights record when the country hosted an important Commonwealth Summit.	• Watching and responding to protest and crackdown in Turkey, Ukraine and Thailand.	• Continuing to speak out about entrenched human rights violations in Israel.	• Highlighting that important human rights protections are at stake in high profile cases such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Wikileaks, dealing with surveillance, secrecy and access to information in the digital age.	• Pressing for human rights not to take a back seat to trade and investment in China.	• And, at year’s end, mobilizing quickly in the face of a spiralling human rights nightmare in the Central African Republic.  
Amnesty International was and is active on all of those fronts: documenting the violations, standing with survivors, supporting front line activists, speaking to the media, and campaigning for change. 
	And we stay vigilant as well with respect to pressing human rights concerns closer to home.	  
Our campaigning to end violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada is nearing the ten year mark; and with that approaching milestone this was a year of remarkable activity and progress.  All provincial and territorial premiers have spoken out.  All provincial, territorial and national human rights commissions have spoken out.  Three missions to Canada this year by UN and Inter-American human rights experts examined this grave human rights problem.  And in October more Canadians participated in ‘Stolen Sisters’ vigils than ever before. 
We have actively drawn attention to other pressing human rights concerns facing Indigenous peoples in Canada as well, including failure to uphold important land and resource rights and to ensure equal respect for Indigenous peoples of such crucial rights as access to safe water, education and child protection. 
	And we have taken action with respect to other concerns about women’s human rights, such as the consistent refusal of the Canadian government to recognize how important sexual and reproductive rights are in addressing such serious human rights challenges as maternal mortality, sexual violence in armed conflict and the practice of early and forced marriage. 
	We continued to highlight the need for greater accountability for Canadian mining, oil and gas companies operating around the world, very often at the frontlines of armed conflict, grave human rights violations and extreme poverty.  Over the course of this year we have drawn particular attention to concerns associated with Canadian mining companies in Guatemala. 
	We have highlighted that Quebec’s proposed Charter of Values infringes key international human rights norms.  We have spoken out about failings in Canadian refugee laws and policy, such as the shameful decision to cutback funding for refugee healthcare.   And we have continued to push Canada to ensure that human rights are not trumped by national security, such as the guidelines allowing information obtained under torture to be used by Canadian intelligence agencies and the continuing failure to recognize that Omar Khadr’s rights as a child soldier must be respected.	  
We have pursued all of this work and more in so many different ways.  We have promoted petitions and letter writing through our web-sites, Facebook and Twitter.  Volunteer lawyers have intervened on our behalf in important court cases, including three times this year at the Supreme Court of Canada. We have organized public events such as film festivals, concerts and talks.  We have been out in the street; in schools; and at summer fairs.  We have been in MPs’ offices; before Parliamentary Committees; and on the evening news.  We have spoken to family and friends, co-workers and strangers.  We have travelled to the frontlines in Africa and in Canada; to the UN in New York and Geneva; and to lecture halls and shopping malls just down the street.  And at the end of the year we have again gathered in such impressive numbers across the country at events as part of our annual Write for Rights campaign marking International Human Rights Day. 
  
All of that energy and determination lies behind the many moments of triumph.  All of that energy and determination is what gives us the resolve to dig down deep and confront the continuing situations of despair. 
And it all is possible only because of you.  Your support through activism and through generous financial support is what helps to unlock the prison doors for Hamid Ghassemi-Shall and Bushra Gamar; stand with Khadija and her family in a Darfuri refugee camp; convince states to adopt the wonderful new Arms Trade Treaty; and insist, ever louder, that the crisis in Syria come to an end. 
	Thank you.  I hope we can count on your continued – and even increased – support in 2014. 
  
	Sincerely,

On the surface, everything is quiet in Bangui, the tiny capital city of the Central African Republic. Strangely quiet. But behind this silence, stories of devastation are emerging. The city is calm but people are afraid. 
	There are virtually no cars on the road and an eerie silence is hanging over the city.  And then you hear a short burst of gunfire coming from one of the various quartiers which have been beset by fighting since early yesterday or French fighter jets do a sudden and unexpected fly-pass, making their presence in the city known. 
	There is no clear toll of those killed or wounded in the attacks between so-called anti-Balaka, said to be loyal to ousted President Bozizé, and the former Seleka forces of new President Djotodia. But those in the know say at least 200 have been killed, making it the largest death toll in one day since this crisis erupted. 
Bodies are being picked up from around the city and brought to the central morgue and the Hôpital Communautaire. They are arriving from Christian and Muslim neighbourhoods alike, some wounded by bullets and shrapnel, others clearly the victims of machete and knife attacks. 
	It is women to whom the task of collecting the bodies has fallen. Only they can venture out. They are collecting corpses in wheelbarrows and, when brave enough, delivering them to hospitals or morgues. In some instances they are burying them in their back yards, not daring to venture further afield. 
	Insecurity also makes it hard for those in need of treatment to reach the hospitals. Likewise, the doctors who could be providing the emergency treatment are unable to leave their homes to help the wounded. The city has shut down. 
	The sense of insecurity is all-pervading. One human rights defender spoke to Amnesty International from what should have been the security of his own home. But even there he was afraid to be heard, whispering as he shared the latest news from his community. 
	Reports are also emerging of former Seleka patrolling some neighbourhoods, opening fire indiscriminately, kicking down doors, pillaging and even killing. People are taking refuge in churches, ill-equipped to handle the security situation, let alone providing the necessary sanitation or food. Bangui airport is also said to be over-run by thousands of people seeking protection from the French forces protecting this strategic location. 
	But it is not just the Muslim former Seleka armed groups who pose a threat to security. As fighting broke out in Bangui, more than 50 bodies were brought to a mosque in PK5, one of the city’s Muslim neighbourhoods. 
	This violence mirrors what has been happening the length and breadth of the country for many months. The silent crisis has finally reached Bangui, just as the UN Security Council, driven by France, is waking up to the looming catastrophe facing the besieged people of the Central African Republic. 
	While the world mourns the tragic death of Nelson Mandela, in this other corner of Africa people are suffering and in need of urgent action. This is not a time to forget these people. If anything, the legacy of Madiba should remind us of our duty to fight to protect those who are suffering.

Amnesty International paid tribute today to one of the world’s most visionary leaders in the fight to protect and promote human rights, Nelson Mandela. 
 
The death of Nelson Mandela is not just a loss for South Africa. It is a loss for people all over the world who are fighting for freedom, for justice and for an end to discrimination.   
“As a world leader who refused to accept injustice, Nelson Mandela’s courage helped change our entire world,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. “His death leaves a massive hole, not just in South Africa but around the world.” 
“Nelson Mandela’s commitment to human rights was epitomised by his unswerving resolve to stamp out racial inequality during apartheid, followed by his vital work in combating HIV/AIDS in South Africa. His legacy across Africa, and the world, will stand for generations.” 
Nelson Mandela’s life of political struggle and self-sacrifice stands as an example to millions around the globe. His grace under pressure, his courage and integrity and his commitment to healing and forgiveness over revenge and hatred was remarkable. 
“One was struck by this man as being somebody quite outstanding,” said Louis Blom-Cooper, who was involved in the foundation of Amnesty International in the early 1960s and was an observer at the long-running trial of Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders on treason charges prior to their acquittal in March 1961. 
	“Literally, to face him and hear him speak, one felt one was in the presence of a very substantial individual who one day would become a very prominent citizen of South Africa.” 
“He had a very appealing face and when he spoke to you, you felt the most important person at that moment was yourself and not him.” 
In the years following his presidency, Nelson Mandela’s outspoken and determined advocacy on behalf of the millions of people living with HIV, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa including South Africa, showed his passion for upholding human dignity, the right to equality and access to justice had not dimmed with time. 
His insistence that these were human rights issues helped to ensure that the circumstances of people living with HIV remained an urgent global concern. 
In November 2006, Amnesty International declared Nelson Mandela an ‘Ambassador of Conscience’ in recognition of his work over many years of speaking out against human rights abuses not just in South Africa but around the world. 
Accepting the award Nelson Mandela said: “Like Amnesty International, I have been struggling for justice and human rights, for long years. I have retired from public life now. But as long as injustice and inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest. We must become stronger still. 
“Through the work of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund, and The Mandela Rhodes Foundation, I am continuing my struggle for human rights.” 
On the same occasion the organization presented Nelson Mandela and the Nelson Mandela Foundation with five volumes of public reports and campaigns issued by Amnesty International between the 1960s and 1994 on human rights abuses in South Africa.     
In accepting the Ambassador of Conscience Award, Nelson Mandela graciously acknowledged Amnesty International’s contribution in the fight for human rights. 
Nelson Mandela was a victim of great injustice, tried and sentenced under a system of apartheid founded on racism and denied a fair trial. 
As Amnesty International noted in its 1978 report on political imprisonment in South Africa:, “While apartheid remains there can be no structure which conforms with and guarantees recognised standards of human rights.” 
“Nelson Mandela was a political prisoner, detained also for his conscience. He was a man who understood how exclusion of groups destroys the social fabric of a country by creating a politics of inequality. The human rights movement around the world owes Nelson Mandela a debt of gratitude. All of us who admired him must carry on his struggle,” said Salil Shetty.

The always photogenic Peña Nieto campaigned on promises that he was the face of a new PRI and a new Mexico that would break with a history of corruption, inequality and violence. Once in office he announced an ambitious programme of reforms and promised he would end the exponential increase in human rights abuses during the presidency of his predecessor Felipe Calderón. 
One year later, it is clear that President Peña Nieto has not delivered on his promises. The situation on the ground remains increasingly dangerous and disturbing. “On the Peña Nieto train, human rights have so far had to settle for the third-class carriage,” concludes Javier Zúñiga, a special adviser with Amnesty International. 
Broken promises have a human cost, one that is paid by a growing number of Mexicans from all walks of life who have fallen victim to deadly threats, a wave of disappearances and widespread use of torture by state officials. 
 
Miriam López is one of those Mexicans. On 2 February 2011, after dropping her children off at school, two men wearing balaclavas suddenly appeared. The men, who were later identified as soldiers, tied Miriam up, blindfolded her, and drove her to a military barracks in the city of Tijuana. For a week, a civilian prosecutor of the Federal Attorney General’s Office directed intensive questioning of Miriam and soldiers raped her repeatedly. They applied electric shocks and threatened Miriam’s family. The torture finally stopped after Miriam signed a statement that falsely implicated her in drug offences. Miriam López spent seven months in prison while waiting for a trial that never began. She was released without any charges against her.	But Miriam is much more than a victim. With enormous courage, she decided to report what was done to her and to seek justice. It is only with justice and by bringing those responsible to account that there is hope for a Mexico free from the scourge of torture. 
You can help! As part of this year’s Write for Rights, you can write a letter to support Miriam’s efforts and help make the promise of human rights in Mexico a reality. Together, we really can create a different future. Join us!

After spending more than a week this November in eastern Chad, interviewing Darfuri refugees in two different refugee camps, I found myself reflecting on how the latest round of violence in Darfur led to yet another influx of refugees into Chad. And in particular it was distressing, but not surprising, to hear how the violence has impacted on women and girls, not only in Darfur, but also on the perilous journey to Chad. 
,  
Fleeing the violence between the Salamat and the Misseriya (two Arab tribes present in Sudan and in Chad), many women fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs and somehow made their way into Chad. Many of them told me about how they had to escape after witnessing their loved ones being shot and killed , their homes burned and their belongings stolen. 
,  
I sat for long hours in the middle of a group of women in the refugee camps listening to their traumatic accounts; to their fears and their hopes. They talked about their past, their present and their future. They had all suffered a great deal. Most had lost their husbands, or other close family members. Many didn’t know where their children were, and whether they were still alive. Some of the women had also been beaten up or shot at, and others had been raped. 
,  
The refugee camps we visited are predominantly populated by women and children. Walking inside Abgadam camp, in the far south-eastern corner of Chad, the absence of men is striking. Some women’s husbands stayed on in Sudan to look after their cattle, or returned to their villages to see what property they could recover. Many have disappeared or been killed. 
,  
One woman from the Masalit tribe who used to live in the Darfuri village of Abujeradil, told me: 
, 	“We woke up in the morning to make breakfast, then heard gun shots from afar, so we got scared and I ran away with my children. My husband refused to come, he wanted to stay and look after our home and cattle. I was later told that he died. He was shot in the chest…. Now I am alone here, with my eight children, and it’s not easy…” 
,  
Another woman, a mother of five, told me how her husband was shot dead as he attempted to run away. He was carrying their five-year-old son at the time. “I ran back to check on them… and saw that they both died on the spot,” she said looking down to the floor, as if trying to hide her pain. 
, 	These are only two of the many accounts I heard while in refugee camps in eastern Chad. What was most humbling was that despite the horrors these women have experienced, they were all striving for a better future. Many told me how they wished to get an education for themselves and, more importantly, for their children. “Lack of education is why we are here now,” many of them said. “Education is our only hope for a better future”. 
,  
,  
Rape and other forms of sexual violence have been features of the armed conflict in Darfur and remain a constant threat for women and girls, both in areas directly affected by the conflict and across the region as the conflict fuels widespread insecurity. 
,  
After speaking with the leaders – men and women – of the Masalit tribe in Goz Amir Camp, I asked the men around us to leave, so the women could speak freely. As soon as the men left, one woman grabbed my arm and told me that armed men had abducted her 10-year-old daughter during the attack on her village. They held the girl for four days, during which time they beat and raped her. Then they abandoned her on the road to Chad. “She is only 10 years old. She came back full of bruises on her body, they beat her and raped her. How could they do that to a child” she said. Indeed, how could anyone do this to a child? 
,  
Many women told me that armed militias harassed and threatened them while they were fleeing to Chad. Some told me that men had tried to rip the clothes off their back. Others told me about women who were abducted in front of their eyes, and reappeared days later, with barely any clothes on them. 
,  
A 20-year-old woman told me how she was locked in a room with many other women from her village. The armed men, who were dressed in military fatigues, came and took “the prettier ones” and raped them. “They came, killed all our men, and then beat us, and raped some of us. They told us we are slaves.” 
,  
What struck me is the way some of these woman have accepted rape as part of their fate. They are too afraid to speak out, because they do not want to be stigmatized by their communities. They are too afraid to report rape, out of fear of being harassed, particularly in cases where the perpetrators are state actors. They have no confidence in the authorities’ ability or willingness to investigate. They know this shouldn’t be happening, but believe that nothing can be done about it. 
,  
UN and humanitarian workers we spoke with confirmed that the number of reported cases of sexual violence is strangely low. They are concerned about those low numbers because they know how rape has been such a central part of a decade of conflict in Darfur. And sure enough, almost every refugee I spoke with – men and women alike – told me that sexual violence, and in particular rape, is still very common in Darfur and certainly happened frequently during the most recent clashes in this region. 
,  
This is not only something that happens in conflict-affected areas. It seems to be part of the rampant insecurity that has prevailed throughout Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, a decade ago. 
,  
Many women and girls are raped when they go out to fetch firewood. One man told me that “sometimes you see a woman come back with torn clothes after disappearing for a few days. You can guess what happened. The problem is that nothing can be done about this.” 
, 	What these women’s traumatic accounts show is how the Sudanese government has utterly failed in its international legal obligations to prevent, protect against and punish these fundamental human rights violations, some of which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity for which individuals can be held criminally responsible. Sudanese authorities must also exercise due diligence to prevent and punish their violation whether by state or non-state actors such as the militias. 
,  
Women’s human rights are often forgotten and treated as a secondary concern, both in and outside of conflict situations. Despite efforts by the international community to address the violations and abuses committed against women and girls, in Darfur – rape and other forms of sexual violence remain a constant threat, and particularly due to the climate of pervasive and widespread impunity. More needs to be done to address the effects of this on-going crisis and to protect women and girls from this continued violence that has lasted for a decade.

Many women and girls are raped when they go out to fetch firewood. One man told me that “sometimes you see a woman come back with torn clothes after disappearing for a few days. You can guess what happened. The problem is that nothing can be done about this.”	What these women’s traumatic accounts show is how the Sudanese government has utterly failed in its international legal obligations to prevent, protect against and punish these fundamental human rights violations, some of which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity for which individuals can be held criminally responsible. Sudanese authorities must also exercise due diligence to prevent and punish their violation whether by state or non-state actors such as the militias. 
Women’s human rights are often forgotten and treated as a secondary concern, both in and outside of conflict situations. Despite efforts by the international community to address the violations and abuses committed against women and girls, in Darfur – rape and other forms of sexual violence remain a constant threat, and particularly due to the climate of pervasive and widespread impunity. More needs to be done to address the effects of this on-going crisis and to protect women and girls from this continued violence that has lasted for a decade.

Earlier this fall the Canadian government significantly down-scaled the diplomatic and financial resources devoted to helping make a difference in Sudan when the high-level Sudan Task Force was disbanded. The decision conveyed a disappointing message that Canada is less concerned about Sudan, at a time when the situation there is the most volatile it has been in years. 
It was an unfortunate decision. There is an urgent need for a renewed global effort to address Sudan’s multiple human rights tragedies. Canada must get back in that game.It is hard to think of another country faced with so many full-blown human rights catastrophes. 
I am currently wrapping up an Amnesty International research mission in Chad, along Sudan’s turbulent western border, investigating a surge in inter-communal violence and human rights violations in Darfur. Earlier this year I worked with another Amnesty team along Sudan’s southern border. We travelled through villages that have endured a harrowing Sudanese aerial bombing campaign in the state of Southern Kordofan and interviewed refugees who have fled into remote reaches of neighbouring South Sudan. 
There is more. Civilians have also suffered terribly in the midst of fighting between the Sudanese military and armed opposition in Blue Nile State. And last month Sudanese authorities responded to widespread popular demonstrations against cuts to fuel subsidies with a harsh crackdown that left at least 200 dead and more than 800 protesters thrown into jail, including members of opposition parties, journalists and activists. 
This year over 30,000 refugees from Darfur have fled into Chad, bringing the number of Darfuri refugees in Chad to close to 300,000. It is the highest influx in seven years.	And while we have been in eastern Chad, fighting has continued to rage just over the border in Darfur. More people killed. More villages set on fire. More people forced from their homes. It is, to say the least, tense. As one recently arrived refugee told me, it is impossible to shake the feeling that the entire region could explode at any moment.	Whether it was earlier this year in South Sudan’s refugee camps and the devastated villages of Southern Kordofan; or this week in the isolated refugee camps in Chad, I have heard similar concerns. 
People wonder whether the world knows what is happening. They fear the world does not care. They implore other countries to make the Sudanese government stop violating their rights. They ask when it will end. 
And there is so much heartbreak. Having fled amidst chaos, many refugee families in Chad are separated. Parents do not know if their children are still alive. Children worry about their missing elderly parents. 
A 10-year-old girl described to me seeing her father shot and killed in front of her in a village in Central Darfur in early April. She told me: “I have never been so afraid in my life. When I’ve been afraid before it is my father who makes me feel okay, but he couldn’t this time.” 
The cycles of displacement have been endless. Starting in 2003, one Darfuri man fled first to a displacement camp inside Darfur, then on to the Central African Republic, back to Darfur and now Chad. As he put it, “I left hell behind me when I fled Darfur the first time. Then hell found me in Central Africa. But it was still hell in Darfur. What will happen to me now in Chad? Will there be hell here also?”	International efforts in the face of these deepening human rights violations are insufficient, disconnected and, ultimately, ineffective. 
There is a UN Security Council sanctioned mission on the ground in Darfur. Sudanese forces keep those UN soldiers away from some of the most troubled parts of Darfur. That is particularly worrying as Sudan does not allow independent human rights monitors and dramatically restricts the activities of international humanitarian organizations in Darfur. The UN mission itself has seen a worrying number of fatalities this year. 
A different Security Council process addresses troubles between Sudan and South Sudan, and gives some minimal attention to the grave situations in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. The Security Council has failed, however, to unequivocally condemn war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Sudanese forces. 
The African Union similarly gives separate attention to these crises, as if they were happening in different countries, and in its most recent report dealing with troubles along the Sudan/South Sudan border did not mention human rights at all. 
An infamously leaky arms embargo has been imposed by the Security Council, but applies only to Darfur, not the rest of Sudan. The Sudanese President and other indicted war criminals have evaded International Criminal Court arrest warrants related to abuses in Darfur for over 6 years now. Tragically and ironically, Ahmed Haroun, indicted for alleged crimes in Darfur when he served as Sudan’s Interior Minister and Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, was, until recently, the Governor of Southern Kordofan. 
A recent effort to intensify pressure on Sudan at the UN Human Rights Council was unsuccessful. The Council has kept scrutiny of Sudan under the lower-key theme of technical assistance and capacity building, making difficult to independently document the human rights situation on the ground. 
There has been little international response to the recent killings and arrests that followed the recent wave of protests across Sudan. Again, it feels as if the world sees those concerns as unrelated to the country’s other human rights problems. 
It is time for a forceful and coherent international response to the multiplying and mounting human rights crises in Sudan. Canada should step up and help lead that effort.

It is not safe at all in Cairo for women and girls. Their freedom of movement is constantly constrained.

Finding a solution 
,  
I’ve been interested in finding a solution for sexual harassment in Egypt since before the “25 January Revolution” in 2011. My first day volunteering with OpAntiSH was during anti-government protests in Tahrir Square on the second anniversary of the “Revolution”. That day, OpAntiSH intervened in 19 cases of violent sexual harassment and attacks by mobs against women in and around Tahrir Square. After we intervened to get another woman to safety after she was assaulted, one of our female volunteers was also attacked by a mob, but we managed to get her to an ambulance. 
,  
To me the experience was very aggressive and traumatizing, but when I saw our activist smiling and talking after everything that had happened to her, I felt empowered to continue. 
,  
OpAntiSH attempts to physically help women and girls by monitoring the situation in Tahrir Square and intervening when mobs assault them. In coordination with others, OpAntiSH also provides medical, psychological and legal support to women and girls when they suffer assaults. 
,  
Beyond Tahrir Square 
,  
We want to expand our work beyond Tahrir Square to other areas where women and girls are at most risk of mob attacks, like the metro and at concerts. Our interventions help diminish the suffering of survivors, and in some cases save their lives. We try to ensure that they receive appropriate medical support and care, as we face a lot of unethical behaviour by medical personnel. If survivors want psychological support, we connect them with other NGOs, like the El Nadim Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence [an Egyptian NGO working to document and combat the crimes of torture and other violence, and to rehabilitate survivors], while completely respecting their privacy and aiming to help them in their healing process. We also connect them with lawyers, but unfortunately Egyptian legislation in itself is problematic. For instance, the definition of rape excludes penetration with objects. 
,  
‘It is infuriating that women can’t enjoy their rights’ 
,  
I continue to volunteer with OpAntiSH because there is no segregation in their approach – there are no specific roles assigned for women and men activists. I am motivated by my belief that there should be no difference in the rights enjoyed by men and women. It is infuriating that women can’t enjoy their rights on par with men. 
,  
After the “25 January Revolution” I became more involved politically, and wanted to protect the space [of Tahrir Square], which enables people to protest and express their views freely. We fought so hard to carve that space for ourselves, and I consider sexual harassment and assault to be a threat to that space – they deter women and girls from practicing their rights to freedom of assembly and expression. It is important for me to continue this work both for political reasons and for human reasons. Women face rape and even death when they participate in public gatherings, and society is silent about this crime. Perpetrators go unpunished. 
,  
The approach of the Egyptian government affects how society perceives and treats women and girls. This approach needs to fundamentally change for the situation to improve. 
,  
In the short term, simple things, like putting lampposts in areas that are dark and where such cases have been reported, can help. OpAntiSH did that on Mohamed Mahmoud Street [an avenue leading to Tahrir Square]. We essentially played the role of the government because it is failing in its duty to protect women and girls. In the long term, structural changes and accountability are needed. For instance, legislation must be amended and perpetrators punished. 
,  
I would like to see international support and activism putting real pressure on the Egyptian government. However, this needs to be a consorted effort by all governments, and the international community like the UN. Unfortunately, many countries don’t see women’s rights as a priority and exploit women’s rights issues only when it is in their interests.

Since 1991, women’s rights activists from around the world have come together for 16 days in November and December to raise awareness about gender-based violence, show solidarity with fellow activists around the world, and take action! 
What is gender-based violence? 
	Gender-based violence is violence directed at a person because of their gender. Due to the disproportionate number of women and girls who face domestic violence, sexual abuse, rape, sexual harassment, trafficking, forced prostitution, and harmful practices, ‘16 days’ focuses on women and girls. 
Why 16 days? 
	The activist calendar is packed with significant dates related to gender-based violence in the 16 days from November 25th to December 10th. 
What can I do? 
Write a letter in support of women in Sudan, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt: 
SUDAN: repeal law on “indecent” clothingSYRIA/JORDAN: ensure safety for refugee women and girlsEGYPT: stop sexual violence 
As part of our Write for Rights letter-writing marathon, take action on the case of Miriam Lopez of Mexico. 
Share our letter-writing actions on social media using the hashtag #16Days 
On Monday, November 25 at 10:00 EST, join a live Facebook chat with Amnesty International experts based in London about sexual and gender-based violence and what Amnesty International is doing to help end this violence. 
Take part in “16 days” events in your community. Promote women’s rights issues during other human rights-related events being held during these 16 days. 
Join our Facebook group on women’s rights to stay up to date on the latest news and actions, or follow us on Twitter. 
Background: What’s the focus of this year’s ‘16 days’ actions? 
Amnesty International is focusing on sexual violence during and after conflict, and violence perpetrated by state actors. 
Rape and other forms of sexual violence are common in armed conflict and sometimes used as a tactic during conflicts to create fear and punish victims and their communities. Sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations reinforces gendered and political hierarchies and remains one of the major barriers to women’s safety. The fear of sexual violence affects women’s ability to travel or move around freely and have a significant impact on wellbeing. 
In places where there is no recognized conflict, militarized violence against civilians by uniformed personnel remains common practice. Individuals in positions of authority may believe they can commit crimes with impunity. There are often high rates of sexual violence within the military, threats by police to women reporting cases of violence, violations committed by peacekeeping forces, and violence against women and girls living and working in close proximity to military bases. 
What rights are violated? 
	Gender-based violence violates a whole range of fundamental human rights including but not limited to the right to life; the right not to be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to equal protection according to humanitarian norms in time or international or internal armed conflict; the right to liberty and security of person; the right to equal protection under the law; the right to equality in the family; and the right to the highest standard attainable of physical and mental health. 
What is Amnesty International calling for? 
Amnesty International supports and shows solidarity to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and women human rights defenders who are working to end sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls.

Tension is building fast along the Chad/Sudan border. The signs of a worsening human rights situation in Sudan’s neighbouring Darfur region have been growing for months, including while we have been travelling in areas close to the border during this mission. Fighting and human rights violations are always more prevalent during the dry season. And the end of the rainy season this year has certainly brought a sharp increase in violence. 
Fighting is raging between various ethnic groups on the Darfur side of the border, particularly between two Arab tribes, the Salamat and Misseriya, who have been allies in the past. More villages are being attacked and left in ruins. That means more people killed and injured. It also means more women and girls being raped, though it is as of yet impossible to get a clear read on how widespread that has become. Homes and businesses are being set on fire and destroyed.  Looting and theft, of livestock and personal property, is pervasive. 
And tens of thousands of people are on the move. More than 30,000 have crossed over into Chad as refugees since the beginning of the year, the highest number to flee in years. Some have settled in refugee camps, others remain dispersed near the border. Untold thousands more are newly displaced in Darfur, where they are too far from the border to reach safety in Chad. Capacity to assist refugees in remote areas of eastern Chad is already strained and will be all the more so if there is another large influx. 
Meanwhile, relations between Chad and Sudan – which have been amicable since 2010 after years of belligerence, cross border clashes, and support for armed opposition groups – appear to be increasingly strained because the current violence is so close to their shared border. Chad fears that the fighting might again spill over into its territory, as it has in the past. Sudan assumes that armed groups carrying out attacks in Sudan may use refugee camps in Chad for shelter. If the two countries return to warmongering and finger-pointing, that will most certainly not make things any easier for Darfuris displaced on either side of the border.  
No wonder that a young man I spoke with in the Abgadam Refugee Camp, not far from the volatile conflux of the borders of Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic (CAR), told me that it always feels like “something could explode at any moment.” One more cattle raid. One more village attacked. One more wave of refugees. A further turn for the worse in CAR. And this region could explode. 
Yet the world does not seem to be paying close attention. In the same camp, meeting with a group of Sheikhs representing the Masalit community, our Amnesty delegation was thanked profusely for coming. They told us they are very grateful for all that the international community is doing to provide them with food and water. But they asked us if the rest of the world knows how quickly things are “changing for the worse” in Darfur?  
Last Thursday, 14 November, as we prepared to leave the area surrounding Abgadam Camp, fighting along the border intensified again. Reports came in of several people killed, and people on the Chadian side of the border described seeing villages in Darfur engulfed in smoke. It felt as if everyone – refugees, humanitarian workers, UN officials and Chadian authorities – was collectively holding their breath. 
Rumours swirl. Will there be further counter-attacks? Are more refugees coming? What of the thousands of refugees living in the brush, most of them Misseriya, around Abgadam Camp, with its largely Salamat inhabitants? 
 
And there is increasing talk of possibly relocating refugees to a new camp further away from the border. It would be an understatement to say that Abgadam is located in a very volatile area. At the same time it is where the refugees want to be. They have close ties with the Chadian population in this area and feel that they are close enough to go back home as soon as it becomes safe to do so. When we have asked refugees at Abgadam what they thought of the possibility that they might be transferred to a new site several hundred kilometres further inside Chad, we hear nothing but defiance. 
	One elderly man told me: “I’m too old to be moved to a place where we have no friends. I won’t go. I’d rather go back and die in Darfur or even die right here.” 
No decisions about relocation have been made, but the rumours themselves have most definitely become a source of considerable agitation. 
Many times over the course of this mission I have found myself remembering the women, men and young people I’ve encountered in recent missions not that far from here, along the South Sudan/Sudan border, investigating human rights violations in Sudan’s Southern Kordofan State. 
During interviews in April 2012 in the sprawling Yida Refugee Camp in South Sudan’s Unity State, very close to the Sudanese border, or in January 2013 as we travelled through villages that have been bombed in Southern Kordofan, the themes that emerged and the questions we were asked were so similar to what we are hearing now in Chad. “When will this end?” “Does the world know what is happening?” “Why do they want to move us from this refugee camp? We won’t go.” “Please make the Sudanese government stop violating our rights.” 
Two different conflicts, two different borders, two different countries sheltering refugees. But behind the myriad human rights violations, one nation – Sudan. It is time for concerted and unified global action to end human rights violations in Sudan – everywhere in Sudan. We can’t keep waiting for things to explode, again and again. Renewed and determined efforts to protect human rights throughout Sudan must become a priority for world leaders, particularly within the UN Security Council and the African Union.

	Everybody in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, knows all about “CHOGM” – pronounced “choggum”. They speak with enthusiasm, resignation or indignation about the fact that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is taking place here. The streets are garlanded with banners welcoming CHOGM delegates, and the face of the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
	Inside the tranquil tropical gardens of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, journalists and delegates scurry back and forth from venue to venue. A clutch of events have been taking place all week ahead of the main summit that opens today (15 November), with Prince Charles representing the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. 
	For Rajapaksa and his government, it is obviously a privilege to be hosting CHOGM – a surprising choice, by any measure, given the country’s dismal human rights track record, including alleged war crimes and disappearances, and what a UN report described as “a grave assault on the entire regime of international law”. 
	Rajapaksa wants to ensure that the Sri Lankan government comes out of this with his reputation enhanced. As one slogan proclaims, Rajapaksa “won the country” (with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers in a most bloody 2009 end to the protracted armed conflict), and now he can “win the world”. 
	In terms of enhancing the country’s reputation, you might say that Rajapaksa and his colleagues are not doing a great job. In the lead-up to CHOGM, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of the judiciary was among those refused entry to the country. 
Crackdown on dissent 
	Reporters from the UK broadcaster Channel 4 – which worked closely with Amnesty International on producing the powerful, game-changing Killing Fields and No Fire Zone films on Sri Lanka – were blocked from travelling to the north of the island when a “spontaneous” demonstration broke out. This week, relatives of the disappeared, who wanted to come from the largely Tamil north to Colombo for a peaceful “human rights festival” behind closed doors were turned back – because they “might cause a breach of the peace”. Partly violent counter-protests by government supporters, by contrast, were allowed to go ahead with no problems. 
	For Amnesty International, the summit provides a powerful opportunity to ensure that the human rights voice is heard. The good news is that journalists want to hear what Amnesty has to say. And diplomats, too, are interested in our findings – even if they do not always act on them. 
	Under the spreading banyan trees in the old town of Galle, after a speech by the President, I did get a chance to speak briefly to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma. I doubt I was able to convince him that the policy of quiet engagement with the Sri Lankan authorities is not delivering, which is how Amnesty International sees it. 
	Beyond media interviews and diplomatic lobbying, I have spent much of my time in Colombo meeting with some of Sri Lanka’s extraordinarily brave human rights defenders – Sinhala and Tamil alike – who talk calmly about the threats against them even as they insist on the necessity of continuing the work. 
 Amnesty’s campaign 
An Amnesty International petition gained close to 200,000 signatures, demanding truth and accountability, so urgently needed for all sides. Those global demands have helped strengthen the backbone of those governments which are wavering when confronted with the familiar question: do they do the right thing, or the comfortable thing? The Prime Ministers of Mauritius, India and Canada have boycotted. The UK has promised to bring strong messages. South Africa has sent mixed messages so far (without truth, how can there be reconciliation?). And Australia: well, let’s not go there. Prime Minister Tony Abbott seems ready, because of domestic considerations on refugee policy, to use the phrase “not lecturing” as an excuse to remain completely silent on violations. 
	The Sri Lankans I speak to are grateful for Amnesty International’s long-term engagement on the cause of human rights in Sri Lanka. 
	There is little likelihood of a rosy ending to this story by the time CHOGM wraps up and the Commonwealth leaders and global media machine move on. 
	But the pressure will continue: the UN Human Rights Council meets again in March, with a resolution critical of Sri Lanka likely to be on the table. With enough energy from around the world, that may include achieving an international inquiry. And if that is achieved, it will be a human rights victory to be proud of.

Valentina Cherevatenko is the head of a Russian non-governmental organization (NGO) which is being sued under the so-called “foreign agents law”. The law, enacted by the Russian authorities late last year, requires any NGO receiving foreign funding and engaging in what it defines very loosely as “political activity” to register as an “organization performing the functions of a foreign agent”. Here is her commentary on the law and its impact in Russia. 
  
Earlier this year we celebrated the 20th anniversary of our NGO – the Union of Women of the Don, named after the mighty river Don which flows near our city Novocherkassk, in southern Russia’s Rostov region. 
For 20 years we have focused on the promotion of human rights and peace through non-violent means. It came as a shock to us when in March this year our offices were raided by a host of authorities – the prosecution office, the tax office, the police, the security services, the fire brigade and the financial auditors. Ostensibly, they wanted to check on our activities in connection with the “foreign agents law.” 
We have never kept our activities secret – we have helped thousands of people who can testify to this. 
Our NGO has lawyers, human rights defenders and psychologists on hand to advise people from around the region on a range of issues affecting their everyday lives – family, labour, housing, pensions. More than 12,000 people have visited our surgeries. 
More than 7,000 people – military and civilians, teachers and students; members of parliament and local administrations, journalists and police from all over Russia have taken part in our projects. In the last two decades, we have dealt with violence against women, gender discrimination, peace and cooperation between different peoples, cooperation with law enforcement and human rights. 
Over time we have grown, and now we are one of the biggest and most influential NGOs in the Rostov Region. The Union of the Women on the Don includes eight groups and more than 60 activists in different cities across the region. 
We have been providing material and psychological support to people who became destitute and homeless as a result of flooding in the town of Krymsk, which was completely submerged under water in July last year. With the help of 250 volunteers, soon after the flooding, we sent trucks with clothes, drinking water, hygiene materials and food. We organized a seminar to educate teachers from the town on how to counsel the victims of flooding. 
Since last December we have been working on a project to promote dialogue and tolerance between different sectors of society. In this dialogue we want to promote different voices on the most important issues of our everyday life and we want this to be done in a civilized, tolerant manner. We want people to learn to respect different points of view. 
So, are we really foreign agents? Who are we working for if not for our own people? How can our activities be viewed as “political”? 
Russian law does not define what constitutes “political activity”. This has given the authorities free rein to prosecute NGOs on a whim! 
In the last eight months following the March raid on our organization we have spent hours and hours trying to prove that our only aim is to help ordinary people in their everyday lives – is this a political ambition? Maybe this should be the ambition of all politicians. 
The Union of Women of the Don have nothing to be ashamed of and we have nothing to feel guilty for. We are proud of our work. That’s why, at a meeting of the organization we decided that we cannot and should not label ourselves as “foreign agents”. 
The courts threw out all of the administrative charges against us. However, we are being sued now for refusing to register as “foreign agents”. 
What will become of us, I don’t know. I don’t know what will happen to me, because my work is my life. 
I know that everyday people who we have helped are phoning us to offer support. 
The closure of our organization will affect so many people. It will be really awful if the authorities try to make us close down our organization by making life impossible.

But we believed we were safe every other time we moved to a different village or [internally displaced persons] camp. Something always happens that makes us have to flee again.”	–    Refugee from Darfur, Goz Amir Refugee Camp, eastern Chad, 10 November 2013 
	We have spent the past two days interviewing Darfuri refugees who fled from Sudan to eastern Chad earlier this year. Most came in April after a surge in fighting and grave human rights abuses in Central Darfur State – some of the worst violence in the region in years. At least 50,000 refugees have arrived in Chad this year, joining 250,000 who have already been here for the past decade. It is the highest refugee exodus out of Darfur since 2006. 
	Over the coming days we will gather more details about what lies behind this despairing turn for the worse in Darfur. It is already clear that there is a very worrying complexity to the fighting. Notably, two Arab tribes, the Salamat and Misseriya, who were allied in the past, seem now to have become sworn enemies. That adds a particularly volatile dimension to a conflict that was already very fragmented and unpredictable. 
	This year marks the 10th anniversary of Darfur’s agonizing human rights and humanitarian tragedy. How troubling then that not only do lasting solutions to the crisis continue to elude the people of Darfur and the world community but – worse – a new chapter of killings, rape and mass displacement is being written. 
	Interviewing dozens of refugees at Goz Amir camp, numerous common themes have emerged. Most critically, we’ve documented the eyewitness testimonies from survivors of a massive armed attack on the town of Abu Jeradil and several surrounding villages in early April. Together they tell a story of tremendous chaos and indiscriminate violence. 
	Particularly haunting, however, was the frequency with which refugees shared with us their long personal and family histories of endless displacement over the past decade. It would be sorrowful enough to have endured the fear and hardship of having fled their homes in April. But for almost everyone, this was just one more instance of fleeing and escaping, in a long line of others going back years. 
	For many the story begins with a village being attacked and destroyed by Janjaweed fighters back in 2003 or 2004. Many lost loved ones at the time. Homes were burned and everything was lost. Some fled to other towns and villages, only to come under attack again weeks or months later. Many of those we interviewed had arrived in Abu Jeradil after trying to find safety in three or four other villages over many years. 
	Some – particularly the young men – went as far as moving to Khartoum or other large Sudanese cities where they were later rounded up during mass arrests of Darfuris on suspicion of being involved in armed opposition groups. Once released, they were certainly on the move again. 
	Large numbers, of course, took shelter in Darfur’s vast network of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where conditions remained precarious and dangerous, particularly for women when they travelled outside camps in search of firewood. And some, therefore, left the IDP sites behind in search of somewhere safer. 
	Many have been crossing borders frequently in an area that brings together the turbulence of Darfur, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Chad. Darfuris have fled to CAR, then back to Darfur when chaos and unimaginable violence erupted there. Chadians have fled to Darfur and then back to Chad. Central Africans have fled across both borders to escape the spiralling violence in their own country. 
	I interviewed one Darfuri refugee who had fled first to CAR, then back to Darfur and now on to Chad. As he put it, “I left hell behind me when I fled Darfur the first time. Then hell found me in Central Africa. But it was still hell in Darfur. What will happen to me now in Chad? Will there be hell here also?” 
	One man, in tears, spoke of his hard work in building a good life for his family only to have it completely destroyed in a Janjaweed attack in 2004, forcing him to flee first to an IDP camp and then eventually to Abu Jeradil. There, he and his brother had worked hard again and were able to open a small shop and provide for their large families – only to see it all go up in smoke when the town was attacked and virtually all buildings destroyed by fire in April of this year. He told me, “they didn’t even steal anything; they just set it all on fire. It was clear they were trying to destroy our lives, not take our things.” 
	One woman spoke of her son, who she says she has only seen about once every two years as he has fled from one place to another. She worries about the younger generation who, she worries, “do not know what it is to have a place as your home”. 
	So accustomed are Darfuri refugees to this endless displacement that many expressed doubt that the situation would remain safe for them in the refugee camp. As one man told me, “something always happens that makes us have to flee again”. 
	It is intolerable that this crisis of human rights abuse, forced displacement and conflict has gone on for a decade. It is impossible to stand by and watch as it gets worse now. We must increase the pressure for real solutions to the Darfur crisis.

	I am jailed, with around 200 other inmates, in a wide hall that looks like a warehouse. For all of us, there are only three toilets. Most of the inmates sleep on the floor, which has never been swept. About 1,000 prisoners share the small open space here at Kaliti Prison. One can guess our fate if a communicable disease breaks out. 
	I was arrested in September 2011 and detained for nine months before I was found guilty in June 2012 under Ethiopia’s overly broad Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, which ostensibly covers the “planning, preparation, conspiracy, incitement and attempt” of terrorist acts. In reality, the law has been used as a pretext to detain journalists who criticize the government. Last July, I was sentenced to 18 years in prison. 
I’ve never conspired to overthrow the government; all I did was report on the Arab Spring and suggest that something similar might happen in Ethiopia if the authoritarian regime didn’t reform. The state’s main evidence against me was a YouTube video of me, saying this at a public meeting. I also dared to question the government’s ludicrous claim that jailed journalists were terrorists. 
Under the previous regime of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, I was detained. So was my wife, Serkalem Fasil. She gave birth to our son in prison in 2005. (She was released in 2007.) Our newspapers were shut down under laws that claim to fight terrorism but really just muzzle the press. 
	We need the United States to speak out. In the long march of history, at least two poles of attraction and antagonism have been the norm in world politics. Rarely has only one nation carried the burden of leadership. The unipolar world of the 21st century, dominated for the past two decades by the United States, is a historical anomaly. And given America’s role, it bears a responsibility to defend democracy and speak out against those nations that trample it. 
	… not much has changed since our last dictator, Mr. Meles, died last August. There have been no major policy changes. The draconian press and antiterrorism laws are still there. There has been no improvement when it comes to press freedom. 
With a population fast approaching 100 million, Ethiopia, unlike Somalia, is simply too big to ignore or contain with America’s regional proxies. 
As Ethiopia goes, so goes the whole Horn of Africa — a region where instability can have major security and humanitarian implications for the United States and Europe. Al Qaeda has a presence here, and hundreds of millions of aid dollars flow into the region while millions of emigrants flow out. 
In other words, Ethiopia must not be allowed to implode. And it would be irresponsible for the world’s lone superpower to stand by and do nothing.	  
… tyranny is increasingly unsustainable in this post-cold-war era. It is doomed to failure. But it must be prodded to exit the stage with a whimper — not the bang that extremists long for. 
I am confident that America will eventually do the right thing. After all, the new century is the age of democracy primarily because of the United States. 
Here in the Ethiopian gulag, this alone is reason enough to pay homage to the land of the brave.

“Everything around us was disappearing… The clean water, our way of life, our traditions, even the wild rice picking and blueberry picking were all disappearing” – Judy DaSilva, Grassy Narrows First Nation on the impact of clearcut logging on their traditional lands 
,  
The province of Ontario is asking for public comments on a plan to resume clearcut logging in the traditional territory of the Grassy Narrows First Nation. The people of Grassy Narrows have already said no to such logging. Amnesty International believes Ontario must listen. We’re encouraging all our members in Ontario to take this opportunity to speak out for the human rights of the people of Grassy Narrows. 
,  
The deadline for submissions has passed.   
,  
Thank you to the more than 1,200 Ontarians who submitted their comment on the proposal to resume clearcut logging on the traditional territory of the Grassy Narrows First Nation. 
,  
We encourage you to continue to speak out in support of the rights of the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation by sending a letter to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne.

,  
Background 
,  
International human rights standards recognize that Indigenous peoples have the right to make their own decisions about how their lands and resources should be used. This includes the right to say no to forms of development that threaten their culture and well-being. 
,  
The situation of the people of Grassy Narrows provides a particularly stark example of why this right is so important. 
,  
Mercury dumped into their river system throughout the 1960s devastated their health, economy and ability to live off the land according to their customs and traditions. In an effort to restore their community, the people of Grassy Narrows tried to negotiate greater control over their traditional lands. The Ontario government refused. Instead, the province promoted massive clear-cut logging throughout the territory. 
,  
As a result of this decision — made without consultation and imposed without consent — trap lines were destroyed, crucial wildlife was driven away, and the people of Grassy Narrows were pushed even closer to the brink. As community member Judy DaSilva recounts, “Everything around us was disappearing.” 
,  
Five years ago, the community won a crucial victory. A major US paper company announced that because of human rights concerns it would not buy pulp sourced at Grassy Narrows so long as the First Nation was opposed to such logging. This decision, together with an ongoing blockade, a court case, and other challenges brought by the community, soon halted clearcut logging at Grassy Narrows. It also led to the province finally entering into high level forest management talks with the community, just as the people of Grassy Narrows had long demanded. 
,  
Yet, despite this, the Ontario government has still not made any commitment to respect the rights of the people of Grassy Narrows. While talks continue, the province has issued a new, draft 10-year management plan for the Whiskey Jack Forest in which province proposes to once again license massive clearcutting in the territory – against the wishes of the people of Grassy Narrows. 
,  
If the province moves ahead with these plans, it would deny the people of Grassy Narrows the opportunity to make their own decisions about what’s best for their economy and culture. New clearcutting could  also release even more mercury into Grassy Narrows’ rivers and lakes.

The situation of the people of Grassy Narrows provides a particularly stark example of why this right is so important. 
Mercury dumped into their river system throughout the 1960s devastated their health, economy and ability to live off the land according to their customs and traditions. In an effort to restore their community, the people of Grassy Narrows tried to negotiate greater control over their traditional lands. The Ontario government refused. Instead, the province promoted massive clear-cut logging throughout the territory. 
As a result of this decision — made without consultation and imposed without consent — trap lines were destroyed, crucial wildlife was driven away, and the people of Grassy Narrows were pushed even closer to the brink. As community member Judy DaSilva recounts, “Everything around us was disappearing.” 
Five years ago, the community won a crucial victory. A major US paper company announced that because of human rights concerns it would not buy pulp sourced at Grassy Narrows so long as the First Nation was opposed to such logging. This decision, together with an ongoing blockade, a court case, and other challenges brought by the community, soon halted clearcut logging at Grassy Narrows. It also led to the province finally entering into high level forest management talks with the community, just as the people of Grassy Narrows had long demanded. 
Yet, despite this, the Ontario government has still not made any commitment to respect the rights of the people of Grassy Narrows. While talks continue, the province has issued a new, draft 10-year management plan for the Whiskey Jack Forest in which province proposes to once again license massive clearcutting in the territory – against the wishes of the people of Grassy Narrows. 
If the province moves ahead with these plans, it would deny the people of Grassy Narrows the opportunity to make their own decisions about what’s best for their economy and culture. New clearcutting could  also release even more mercury into Grassy Narrows’ rivers and lakes.

She was arrested by police earlier this month as she filmed a female driver breaking the ban.   
If there was one word to describe what it is like to be a Saudi woman, it would be the word patronizing. No matter how long you live, you remain a minor in the eyes of the government. 
In Saudi Arabia we take patriarchy to the extreme. The fact that the culture, like many others around the world, is male-dominated is not the major challenge. The real challenge is that the government has allowed this patriarchy to dictate how it deals with citizens. Female citizens are assigned a legal male guardian from her immediate relatives. This male guardian can legally marry her off as a child to a man decades her senior. He can also legally and easily ban her from education, work and marriage. He has to pre-approve any international travel officially. Since basic education is free and college education comes with a stipend paid by the government to all public college students, most male guardians prefer to send their daughters to school. Yet in those cases where the male guardian chooses to imprison his female ward at home, the legal system makes it almost impossible for her to be able to get away. 
The de facto ban on women driving is one of the main things that perpetuates this governmental patriarchy. Currently there is no public transportation system available. You cannot walk to the corner and catch a bus or take the subway except in Mecca. Thus for any woman to get from point A to point B, she doesn’t only have to buy a car but convince a male relative or employ a man from South East Asia to drive that car. This day-to-day obstacle has proven to be a demoralizing deterrent for many women from pursuing an education, a career and even maintaining their own healthcare. 
When government officials are asked about the driving ban, they respond that there is no legal or Islamic basis for it and that it is only socially maintained. The King himself stated so. Others who have made similar statements include the Minister of Justice, the Head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and the Chief of Traffic Police. Yet when a woman gets behind the wheel of her car, it isn’t society that stops her but the police. In many cases the woman is then taken to the nearest police station and her male guardian is called. The woman and her guardian are both made to sign pledges to ensure that this case of driving while female is not repeated. 
There have been several attempts since 1990 to try to lift this ban on women driving. Among them were proposals sent to the Shura Council by Dr Mohammad Al Zulfa in 2006 and another by Abdullah Al Alami in 2012. Both were not even allowed to be discussed on the floor of the council. There have also been several petitions and requests sent to the Royal Court, which mostly failed to get a response. There were also campaigns to get women just to go out and drive. And they too were met with more of a response from the government than from society.	In 1990, 47 women got into their cars and drove and the government responded with job suspensions and travel bans. In June 2011, Manal Al Sharif made a Youtube video asking women to join her in driving their own cars and was imprisoned for over a week for it. 
Thus the October 26th Women Driving Campaign is the most recent campaign to try to resolve the women driving ban. What makes this campaign special is that it’s the first real civil movement to occur in Saudi Arabia. There is no face to the movement. The petition was written by more than 30 people, many of whom do not know each other. 
The first couple of days the petition went public, we were still accepting revisions to the text. It was only finalized on the third day. Everyone who signs the petition is considered not only an organizer but a leader who can take the initiative to act in the name of the campaign. The campaign itself has Youtube channels and an Instagram account for signatories to upload their driving videos, photos and even just to talk or make a statement through art. Through these means, the campaign aims not only to call on the government to quit its ambiguity regarding the ban but also to demonstrate that officials can no longer use the “society” excuse.

The voice at the other end of the line was grim, the tension palpable as I received news from the front lines of a nationwide, peaceful mobilization of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, organized to draw attention to ongoing assaults on Indigenous lands and lives. 
,  
“State security forces are firing on people,” said Juan Pablo Gutíerrez, whose photographs of threatened Indigenous peoples have toured communities across Canada as part of Amnesty Canada’s Make It Visible campaign. “The number of injured keeps growing. We are in shock. This is a state of emergency.” 
,  
Only days earlier, Juan Pablo had reported miraculously escaping an attack by men on two motorcycles, who shot at the vehicle in which he was travelling, after leaving a meeting. The photographer works with the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, whose members decided to take to the streets across the country to publicly protest repeated failures by the Colombian government to uphold promises to protect Indigenous rights. 
,  
Like Juan Pablo, the Indigenous men, women, and young people taking part in this social protest remain in danger. A paramilitary group sent a written threat demanding that Indigenous demonstrators marching in Cauca, Caldas, Risaralda, La Guajira, Huila and Antioquia Departments return to their communities within 24 hours or face “social cleansing” killings. The paramilitaries warned they would declare Indigenous leaders and organizations as military targets if protests continue. 
,  
Such threats have to be taken incredibly seriously, given the bloody record of paramilitaries in Colombia. 
,  
The violent response of Colombian security forces is also cause for enormous concern. 
,  
In Valle del Cauca, witnesses report that security forces fired tear gas canisters filled with shrapnel directly at demonstrators. Over 60 people were injured. Yet security forces reportedly prevented the wounded from being taken to medical centres for several hours. Evidence of shootings and excessive use of force used against Indigenous demonstrators in other parts of the country are no less horrifying. 
,  
The time is now to speak up for the safety of Indigenous men, women and youth, and their right to freedom of expression via peaceful social protest. The time is now to investigate who gave the order to fire and bring to justice anyone responsible for human rights violations. The time is now to address the legitimate concerns of Indigenous peoples about licences granted for resource extraction by third parties, including Canadian companies, in Indigenous territory, without respect for the right of Indigenous peoples to be consulted and make decisions about what happens on their land.

	On Thursday October 10, Hamid Ghassemi Shall came home to Canada.  
  
	Hamid Ghassemi-Shall spent the past 5- ½ years in Iran’s notorious Evin prison, on charges of espionage, and faced the death penalty.  He was released from prison September 23, along with 80 other political prisoners.  Hamid’s release came on the heels of releases in the previous week of 11 political prisoners, including prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh on whose behalf Amnesty International campaigned relentlessly.	  
All of these releases came in advance of recently elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to the United Nations on October 8 where he made his first speech to the UN. 
	Ghassemi-Shall’s return to Canada provides an opportunity to celebrate, and renews the belief that public campaigning on behalf of individuals can make a difference. Hamid said that in his darkest moment, his hope was renewed knowing that his wife in Canada and family in Iran were doing everything possible to ensure that his nightmare would come to an end.   
	Throughout the time he was detained Amnesty International members across Canada wrote hundreds of letters and signed tens of thousands of petitions and post cards, calling on the Iranian authorities for his release. 	  
The election of President Rouhani has not led to changes in Iran’s reliance on the death penalty, nor opened the door to freedom for other political prisoners. While Hamid Ghassemi Shall is home; thousands of others remain behind bars in Iran, including Abdolfattah Soltani, a human rights lawyer who once defended Hamid, and Saeed Malekpour, a Canadian permanent resident. 
	Saeed Malekpour was originally sentenced to death after a web based program he developed was used by others to post pornographic images to the internet.  He reports he was tortured while held in solitary confinement in Evin prison. His death sentence was recently reduced to life imprisonment. Amnesty International is calling for his unconditional release, if he is being held solely for the creation of his web based program. 
	Amnesty International will continue to campaign on behalf of other Canadian citizens who remain imprisoned abroad following grossly unfair trials including Huseyin Celil and Bashir Makhtal. 
 Huseyin Celil – Detained in China	Huseyin Celil is an indigenous Uighur from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People’s Republic of China.  While visiting his wife’s family in Uzbekistan in 2006, he was detained by Uzbek police and deported to China without the consent of the Canadian government. Mr. Celil was sentenced to life imprisonment in China following an unfair trial, because he advocated for democratic and religious rights for Uighur Muslims in China.  His wife and children live in Hamilton Ontario. 
 Bashir Makhtal – Detained in Ethiopia	Canadian citizen Bashir Makhtal, imprisoned in Ethiopia, also hopes that someday he will be able to come home to Canada.  Bashir Makhtal was arrested in Kenya in 2006 and illegally transferred to Ethiopia. He was held in secret detention, with no access to lawyers, family or Canadian consular officials. Eventually he was accused of providing support to an armed group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) and sentenced to life imprisonment after a grossly unfair trial in 2009. 
 TAKE ACTION NOW! 
Saeed Malekpour:	Help seek justice for Canadian resident detained in Iran. Take action

	The United Nation’s top expert on the human rights of Indigenous peoples says Canada is facing a “crisis” which must be addressed. 
,  
	James Anaya visited Canada this month as part of a fact-finding mission. At a press conference to conclude his visit, the Special Rapporteur said, 
,  
 “The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in Canada has not narrowed over the last several years, treaty and aboriginals claims remain persistently unresolved, and overall there appear to be high levels of distrust among aboriginal peoples toward government at both the federal and provincial levels.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur went on to note that while “Canada consistently ranks near the top among countries with respect to human development standards… aboriginal people live in conditions akin to those in countries that rank much lower and in which poverty abounds.” 
,  
Some of the specific examples raised by the Special rapporteur included: 
,  
• “At least one in five aboriginal Canadians live in homes in need of serious repair, which are often also overcrowded and contaminated with mould.” 
,  
• “The suicide rate among Inuit and First Nations youth on reserve, at more than five times greater than other Canadians, is alarming.” 
,  
• “Aboriginal women are eight times more likely to be murdered than non-indigenous women.” 
,  
• “For over a decade, the Auditor General has repeatedly highlighted significant funding disparities between on-reserve services and those available to other Canadians.” 
,  
Like his predecessor, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, who carried out a research mission to Canada in 2004, Professor Anaya noted that while Canada has taken some important steps to address Indigenous rights, these measures have failed to fundamentally change the situation of Indigenous peoples in Canada. He said that government measures “are insufficient, and have yet to fully respond to aboriginal peoples’ urgent needs, fully protect their aboriginal and treaty rights, or to secure relationships based on mutual trust and common purpose.” 
,  
	The Special Rapporteur was originally scheduled to make a longer visit to Canada but the federal government changed the arrangements so that he would not be in Canada while Parliament was sitting. 
,  
	Certainly, there is a stark contrast between the Special  Rapporteur’s concluding statement on Tuesday and the federal government’s Speech from the Throne on Wednesday. 
,  
	The government has promised that it will work with First Nations to “to develop stronger, more effective, and more accountable on-reserve education systems,” “renew its efforts to address the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women,” and ensure that Indigenous peoples “have every opportunity to benefit” from the development of natural resources. 
,  
	While these are all important directions, nothing in the Throne Speech indicated any willingness to give the rights of Indigenous peoples greater priority than in the past, dedicate the resources needed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, or fulfill Canada’s obligation to advance such initiatives with the full participation of Indigenous peoples. 
,  
	As the Special Rapporteur noted, “Aboriginal peoples’ concerns and well-being merit higher priority at all levels and within all branches of Government, and across all departments. Concerted measures, based on mutual understanding and real partnership with aboriginal peoples, through their own representative institutions, are vital to the long-term resolution of these issues.”

,  
	Amnesty International is following with concern the police and government response to anti-fracking protests by the Elsipogtog Mi’kmaq Nation in New Brunswick. 
, 	 
,  
Like so many disputes around the lands and resources of Indigenous peoples in Canada, this conflict could have been avoided by a rigorous commitment on the part of government to respect and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples as set out in Canadian and international law. 
,  
Three fundamental principles must be observed. 
,  
First, governments in Canada must work with Indigenous peoples to ensure that  land disputes do not continue to linger on as a source frustration and injustice, but are instead resolved in a fair and timely manner consistent with international human rights standards such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Critically, while disputes remain unresolved governments must abandon their business as usual approach that they have the sole authority to use and dispose of the lands in question, but instead commit to working collaboratively with the affected Indigenous peoples with the goal of reaching mutually acceptable interim arrangements. 
,  
Second, consultation around specific development proposals must be meaningful and in good faith. This means there can be no predetermination that projects will go ahead regardless of legitimate concerns raised by the affected communities. 
,  
Third, whenever the proposed projects have the potential for significant impacts on the cultures, livelihoods, health and well-being of Indigenous peoples, or where legitimate questions remain unresolved about the extent of the possible impacts, government must comply with the internationally established standard of free, prior and informed consent or FPIC. As a precautionary principle,  FPIC helps safeguard the rights of Indigenous peoples from bad decisions imposed without their involvement. Just last week, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reminded governments in Canada that FPIC is generally required whenever large scale resource development project are being considered that could have an impact on the rights of Indigenous peoples.

	Amnesty International is following with concern the police and government response to anti-fracking protests by the Elsipogtog Mi’kmaq Nation in New Brunswick. 
Like so many disputes around the lands and resources of Indigenous peoples in Canada, this conflict could have been avoided by a rigorous commitment on the part of government to respect and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples as set out in Canadian and international law. 
Three fundamental principles must be observed. 
First, governments in Canada must work with Indigenous peoples to ensure that  land disputes do not continue to linger on as a source frustration and injustice, but are instead resolved in a fair and timely manner consistent with international human rights standards such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Critically, while disputes remain unresolved governments must abandon their business as usual approach that they have the sole authority to use and dispose of the lands in question, but instead commit to working collaboratively with the affected Indigenous peoples with the goal of reaching mutually acceptable interim arrangements. 
Second, consultation around specific development proposals must be meaningful and in good faith. This means there can be no predetermination that projects will go ahead regardless of legitimate concerns raised by the affected communities. 
Third, whenever the proposed projects have the potential for significant impacts on the cultures, livelihoods, health and well-being of Indigenous peoples, or where legitimate questions remain unresolved about the extent of the possible impacts, government must comply with the internationally established standard of free, prior and informed consent or FPIC. As a precautionary principle,  FPIC helps safeguard the rights of Indigenous peoples from bad decisions imposed without their involvement. Just last week, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reminded governments in Canada that FPIC is generally required whenever large scale resource development project are being considered that could have an impact on the rights of Indigenous peoples. Shale gas fracking on or near the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples is clearly an example where the safeguard of FPIC is required. 
Finally, in regard to policing of protests,  it is important to be mindful that while police have an obligation to protect public safety and respond to criminal offences, they also have a clear responsibility to respect and protect human rights.  Police must respect the right of peaceful protest and assembly and act to protect the lives and safety of those involved in protests. Use of force must always be a last resort and the scale and nature of the force deployed must be in proportion to the need to protect public safety. Critically, police should not be called on to enforce legal claims of governments or corporations where the foundations of these claims is legitimately in question.

By Jackie Hansen, Major Campaigns 
On the rainiest day in months, a group of dedicated Amnesty activists marched from the University of Ottawa campus to the Embassy of the Russian Federation to Canada chanting, “Our birthday wish for Putin… respect for human rights!” 
 
Monday, October 7th marked four months until the start of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, to be held in Sochi, Russia. It also happened to be Russian President Putin’s birthday, and the launch of Amnesty’s global campaign to shine a spotlight on human rights in Russia in the lead-up to the Olympics. 
The space for civil society to express who they are is rapidly shrinking in Russia, and has been since President Putin returned to power in 2012. Two singers from the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in prison for singing a protest song in a cathedral. People protesting the 2012 election peacefully in Moscow were detained and remain in jail. New laws have been passed that make it illegal to engage in LGBTI advocacy, and a new law working its way through parliament would revoke custodial rights for LGBTI parents. 
And most recently, 30 Greenpeace activists—including a friend of mine—were charged with piracy after peacefully protesting Arctic oil drilling in northern Russia, and could face 15 years in prison. 
 
The world is preparing to send its finest athletes to Russia to compete on the global stage. What we want from Russia is not only to shine in sport, but to shine in human rights. Each and every day, human rights violations take place in Russia. We want to raise awareness of these violations, and we want to let activists in Russia know that they aren’t forgotten and that we stand with them. We also want President Putin to know that we only want for Russia what it purportedly wants for itself—freedom of expression, association, and assembly—these rights are enshrined in Russia’s constitution and international human rights agreements to which Russia is party.

,  
Today, 10 October, is World Day Against the Death Penalty. This year abolitionist groups from around the world are focussed on efforts to abolish the death penalty in the Caribbean. Amnesty International released a report today also detailing one of the biggest myths of death penalty supporters – the claim of deterrence. 
,  
In Canada though we have another special reason to celebrate this October 10th. It is the first October 10th in five years in which Canadian citizen Hamid Ghassemi-Shall is not facing possible execution. 
,  
His wife Antonella, who has been a most outspoken and passionate advocate for his release, can look forward to seeing him in person and free rather than communicating by telephone call from him on death row in Tehran. 
,  
In May I wrote a blog about Hamid. It touched particularly on how close Canadians still are to the death penalty despite our own country being free of it or from any fear that it would return here. Many countries today have abolished the death penalty in part from efforts by previous Canadian governments to promote worldwide abolition. It helps not only the citizens of other countries, but Canadians as well, from facing the possibility of this grave violation of human rights at the hands of any state. 
,  
To be clear, Amnesty International does not condone any violent crime. Neither murder by an individual nor murder by the state. Those responsible for violent crime must be punished but in a way that is consistent with human rights and that is effective at preventing future violent crimes. The death penalty is not consistent with human rights and it is not an effective deterrent to crime. In fact, jurisdictions without the death penalty typically have fewer per capita violent crimes than similar jurisdictions that have it. 
,  
Furthermore, the extent to which the death penalty is applied in many states frequently violates international law. In the case of Hamid, he was convicted on vaguely worded charges and with no indication of any lethal consequence to others. The evidence itself was flimsy and left plenty of room for reasonable doubt. 
,  
The use of a mandatory death penalty, such as exists in Trinidad & Tobago and as applied to the original charges Hamid faced, also violates international law and norms on the death penalty. 
,  
While we celebrate Hamid’s freedom and restoration of his rights we must encourage other countries to help realise the rights of all people to be free from the death penalty and a first step in that direction, if not yet achieving abolition, must be to bring laws into line with international obligations under documents like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Economic and Social Council Safeguards for those facing the death penalty. We must also encourage all countries that retain the death penalty to follow the lead of several countries in recent years, such as Mongolia and Pakistan, to establish a moratorium on executions. The UN General Assembly has called four times since 2007 for a worldwide moratorium on executions. 
,  
There is another aspect to these calls that we must highlight. The Canadian government has, since the first of these calls, refused to co-sponsor the moratorium move at the UN. Co-sponsorship is not a financial endorsement, but a moral support. With Canadians still at risk of death sentences (and executions) in several places around the world today, it is not just ‘foreigners’ affected, but Canadians too. As voices for Canada it remains shameful that our government has not co-sponsored any of the General Assembly motions in the past six years, calling for a moratorium on executions. Adding our moral support to such calls helps protect Canadians abroad and also is a zero-cost way to help protect the basic human rights of others. It is a moral obligation our government has failed to abide by and high time that was corrected.

,  
– Omar Khadr, Edmonton Institution, October 5, 2013 
,  
,  
From Afghanistan to Guantánamo Bay and now the outskirts of Edmonton. Who would have thought that human rights campaigning that began with a short news report that a 15 year old Canadian had been arrested by US forces on the battlefield in Afghanistan in the summer of 2002 and continued through a decade of activism, media interviews and legal work while that same young Canadian endured the lawlessness and injustices of Guantánamo Bay; would now bring me to a maximum security prison outside Edmonton. But that is where, after eleven years of working on his case, I recently travelled to meet and spend some time with Omar Khadr. 
,  
Just over a year ago Amnesty International enthusiastically welcomed the news that Omar Khadr, who had been sentenced to an eight year prison term under an October 2010 Guantánamo Bay plea deal, was at long last being transferred back to a Canadian prison. It seemed peculiar to characterize a transfer from one prison to another prison as a human rights victory. But that it was. For leaving Guantánamo behind was one step closer to leaving more than a decade of human rights violations behind as well. And thus we noted that return to Canada was not the end but, more aptly, a first significant step toward justice. 
,  
For much injustice remains. As he returned he still faced six years (now five) of a prison term that had utterly refused to take account of his status as a child soldier when he was captured in 2002 and all of the important international human rights provisions providing protection to children propelled, coerced and misled out onto the battlefield. As he returned the Canadian government had still done nothing (and still has done nothing) to respond to the January 2010 Supreme Court of Canada ruling that found government officials had been complicit in human rights violations Omar had endured at Guantánamo; for which there must be a remedy. And as he returned there had been no independent investigation into the detailed and credible allegations he has made about torture and ill-treatment at the hands of US officials in both Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay. 
,  
I travelled to Guantánamo Bay three times in 2010 to observe the military commission trial against Omar Khadr. Under the strict rules governing NGO’s allowed on the base I was not allowed to speak with him, or any of the prisoners. I would have likely been sent packing on the next flight out if I had so much as said ‘good morning’ while he sat no more than 10 metres from me in the courtroom. 
,  
So this was my first opportunity to have a long overdue conversation. I obviously wanted to hear much from him; and I did. I also wanted to share with him the extent of Amnesty International’s campaigning on his behalf; which I was also able to do. 
,  
Omar was certainly aware that Amnesty had taken up his case. He has heard that from his lawyers and supporters. But it was clearly moving for him to hear and understand the extent of all that activity. And in particular for me to describe to him that the support had come from Amnesty members from all possible walks of life, including student activists and retirees, corporate lawyers, nuns, teachers and academics, and bureaucrats. 
,  
We spoke a great deal about his current situation. I had already heard from others that Omar has become a student with an insatiable appetite for learning and is rapidly making up for the many years of education that were stolen away from him. A remarkable group of volunteer teachers keeps up with his relentless progress through high school subjects and marvels in his obvious yearning to learn. As we spoke it was so very clear that those “classes”, reading and assignments are the highlight of his days. 
,  
It was, however, sadly evident that even after more than a year of being back in Canada, programming has not been put in place that recognizes his right to treatment and support for all he suffered as a child soldier. We wrote to government and corrections officials months ago, highlighting Canada’s obligation to do just that; an obligation that is, in fact, enshrined in international legal texts that Canada championed when they were agreed back in 2000. Clearly we need to reiterate and intensify that message. 
,  
The Canadian courts have, over the years, been fiercely reliable in ruling in Omar’s favour in various challenges highlighting human rights concerns in his case. That includes two Supreme Court judgements that sided with him. Not surprisingly, therefore, his indefatigable legal team has turned to the courts once again, seeking an order that would at long last require the justice and corrections systems to treat him as the juvenile he was back in the summer of 2002. If successful, that would go far in starting to lay the ground for some of the continuing human rights concerns in his case finally to be rectified. 
,  
As our allotted time drew to a close, Omar shared with me a message of thanks to share with Amnesty members who have taken up his case over the years: 
,  
“To members of Amnesty International in Canada and everywhere I want to say thank you for the support and all the work that you have done for me. It has been incredible to come to the realization that there are all these wonderful people out there helping me with my ordeal. Knowing that makes it a bit easier. I am so grateful. Perhaps the one positive thing coming out of all I have been through is to know that there are so many good people in the world, like the members of Amnesty International, willing to stand up for other people. That means so much to me.” 
,  
With that message he so perfectly sums up the essence of Amnesty: willing to stand up for other people. And I was able to assure him that we will most certainly continue to stand up for him.

Over the next week, the United Nation’s top expert on the human rights of Indigenous peoples will be meeting with government officials and First Nations, Inuit and Métis organizations, communitie,s and activists across Canada. 
,  
In his mandate as Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya has carried out research missions to developed and developing countries around the world and published reports on the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Russian Federation, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Botswana, Namibia, Republic of the Congo, Nepal, and New Caledonia, among others. 
,  
The Special Rapporteur has been an active champion of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. James Anaya has said that the Declaration “represents an authoritative common understanding, at the global level, of the minimum content of the rights of indigenous peoples” and that “implementation of the Declaration should be regarded as a political, moral and, yes, legal imperative without qualification.” 
,  
The Special Rapporteur has been especially concerned about the impact of resource development on the rights of Indigenous peoples. In a recent report, the Special Rapporteur noted the “negative, even devastating consequences” when resource development decisions are made without the involvement of the affected peoples. In light of these risks, the Special Rapporteur has concluded that as a “general rule” of international law, the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples is required in decisions about resource development so that their rights can be more securely protected. 
,  
In 2010, investigation of a complaint filed by the Lubicon Cree in northern Alberta, lead the Special Rapporteur to comment on “dire social and economic conditions” faced by the Lubicon as a consequence of their dispossession from lands subject to massive oil and gas development. The Special Rapporteur called for “renewed and resolute steps” to reach a negotiated settlement over Lubicon land and resource rights “in accordance with relevant international standards.” Until such an agreement can be reached, the Special Rapporteur called for “extreme caution in relation to development projects on the disputed lands,” including respect for their right of free, prior and informed consent. 
,  
The Special Rapporteur’s mission to Canada will conclude with a press conference on October 15th.

His report on Canada will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2014.

The Special Rapporteur has been especially concerned about the impact of resource development on the rights of Indigenous peoples. In a recent report, the Special Rapporteur noted the “negative, even devastating consequences” when resource development decisions are made without the involvement of the affected peoples. In light of these risks, the Special Rapporteur has concluded that as a “general rule” of international law, the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples is required in decisions about resource development so that their rights can be more securely protected. 
In 2010, investigation of a complaint filed by the Lubicon Cree in northern Alberta, lead the Special Rapporteur to comment on “dire social and economic conditions” faced by the Lubicon as a consequence of their dispossession from lands subject to massive oil and gas development. The Special Rapporteur called for “renewed and resolute steps” to reach a negotiated settlement over Lubicon land and resource rights “in accordance with relevant international standards.” Until such an agreement can be reached, the Special Rapporteur called for “extreme caution in relation to development projects on the disputed lands,” including respect for their right of free, prior and informed consent. 
The Special Rapporteur’s mission to Canada will conclude with a press conference on October 15th. 
His report on Canada will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2014.

Today, October 7th, is an important moment to reflect on Canada’s long unfulfilled promise to respect the land rights of Indigenous peoples.

By Audrey Gaughran, Director of Global Thematic Issues at Amnesty International 
,  
There are currently two competing narratives about oil pollution in the Niger Delta. 
,  
The first is that oil companies, particularly Shell, are responsible for massive pollution caused by leaks from their operations and for the failure to clean up spills and protect their infrastructure from damage. 
,  
This narrative acknowledges that oil theft and sabotage of oil infrastructure occur and contribute to pollution; however it cautions that theft and sabotage, as causes of pollution, are over-stated by oil companies in a bid to deflect criticism about their environmental impact. 
,  
The second narrative claims that almost all spills are caused by oil theft and sabotage and that companies are doing their best to combat this scourge. It goes on to say that the failure to clean up properly is generally due to the communities not letting the oil companies into the area to do the cleanup. 
,  
What both narratives accept is that the Niger Delta is massively polluted and that those living in the area are suffering the consequences. 
, 	The former lays the blame substantially (although not exclusively) at the door of the oil companies and the government of Nigeria’s pitifully weak regulatory system. The latter blames the communities themselves, local militants and criminals. 
,  
So which narrative is closer to the truth? 
, 	Human rights organizations including Amnesty International and environmental groups share the first argument while oil companies promote the second. 
,  
But the main difference between them is the evidence that underpins them. 
,  
Amnesty International and other NGOs have put significant evidence into the public domain that demonstrates that Shell has underestimated oil spilt due to operational failures and that the company is not transparent about the state of its infrastructure. 
,  
Amongst this evidence is a secretly videoed oil spill investigation where Shell changes the cause from “operational failure” to “sabotage” – doing so unilaterally, with no evidence and after the official investigation was completed. There is also evidence that the methodology used for calculating oil spill volumes is flawed and underestimates the amount of oil spilt. 
,  
Shell’s claims about the proportion of oil spilt due to operational problems rely almost exclusively on data that is compiled by Shell itself, with little or no meaningful oversight. The weakness of Nigeria’s oil regulators has been widely exposed. Most recently, the UN Environment Programme stated that regulators were “at the mercy of oil companies” when it came to visiting oil impacted areas. This echoed a 2006 finding by the UN Development Programme which stated that “oil companies, particularly Shell Petroleum, have operated for over 30 years without appreciable control or environmental regulation to guide their activities.” 
,  
Oil theft and sabotage of oil pipes are serious problems in the Niger Delta. But they will only be dealt with effectively when oil companies also come clean about the scale of operational spills and the condition of their infrastructure, and cease to use them as a way to avoid bad publicity about their environmental and human rights impact. 
,  
A Chatham House report released last Friday highlights the problem of large scale oil theft in the Niger Delta. The report focused on two kinds of theft: large-scale illegal bunkering operations involving organized extraction and transport (taps on pipes, boats for transport) and theft at export terminals, which it says are believed to account for most of Nigeria’s stolen crude. No doubt Shell will latch onto this report and – once again – attempt to suggest oil spills in Nigeria are largely outside its control. 
,  
But oil theft is not the same as oil spills. It is possible for theft to occur with little spillage. Small-scale theft may be more problematic in terms of oil spills than larger, professional operations. But the amount stolen is not the amount spilled. Data available on how much leaves the country as stolen oil underscores that oil theft figures are quite distinct from oil spill data. 
,  
There are other questions that arise if one scrutinizes the information available. One is the fact that many oil spills in the Delta are attributed officially to sabotage, not theft. Sabotage refers to acts that vandalize oil infrastructure, and it is often attributed (although not always accurately) to disgruntled community members seeking compensation. Another, longstanding, question is the age and condition of the pipes. 
,  
Most oil companies do not disclose complete information on their infrastructure. Evidence that has emerged from other sources, however, is alarming. For example, a US diplomatic cable from 2008, published by Wikileaks, stated that a contractor with many years’ experience of laying pipelines in the Niger Delta told the US consulate in Nigeria that “73 per cent of all pipelines there are more than a decade overdue for replacement.” 
,  
Oil theft does lead to some of the oil spill pollution that scars the Niger Delta. But establishing the extent to which oil theft, sabotage and aged and corroded pipes respectively are the cause of pollution requires something the Delta has never had: real transparency over the condition of oil infrastructure and the oil spill investigation process. 
,  
Shell began to do this to some extent in 2011 when it started to publish oil spill investigation reports, but has resolutely refused to disclose data on oil spill investigations that occurred earlier than this. Yet the company continues to use the undisclosed pre-2011 data to blame most oil spills on theft and sabotage. 
,  
Full transparency is vital to establishing real solutions to oil spills and oil theft. But those that resist this most are the oil companies. If they are committed to addressing the Niger Delta’s problems of theft, sabotage and oil spills, why will they not disclose the relevant oil spill investigation data?

By Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Researcher 
,  
As the threat of military intervention looms over an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus, in a far flung corner of Syria the town of Deir Ezzour offers an insight into the suffering of ordinary Syrians. 
,  
Once a thriving hub of Syria’s oil industry, today Deir Ezzour has become a bleak microcosm of the Syrian conflict. The town, on the banks of the Euphrates River, some 450km north-east of the capital, is divided. Half is under the control of Syrian government forces and the other half is in the hands of armed opposition fighters, who also control much of the surrounding areas all the way to the Iraqi border. 
,  
Few outsiders make it to this isolated corner of Syria. No human rights organizations and only a handful of journalists have visited the town. The opposition-controlled section of the town is the only area I can access as the Syrian government has banned Amnesty International and other human rights organizations from areas of the country under its command. The streets are eerily quiet and much of the town is in ruin. Many of the residents have fled. The empty shells of burned and bombed-out buildings line the streets – a testament to the unrelenting air strikes, artillery, mortar and tank shelling by President Bashar al-Assad’s troops. 
,  
The only way in or out of Deir Ezzour is across a bridge which regularly comes under sniper fire from government forces. There is, unsurprisingly, little traffic. A few taxis ferry residents back and forth, driving at breakneck speed to dodge the bullets. 
,  
Those who dare to cross – civilians and fighters alike – are often killed or injured in the process. Within two hours of my arrival in the town, I am at a local hospital, where the reality of that risk strikes home. A young man who was shot while crossing the bridge is brought in and pronounced dead almost immediately. He never stood a chance; a large calibre bullet had had left a gaping wound in his head. 
,  
No one is safe anymore 
,  
Everyone I meet has lost relatives and friends, many in the constant indiscriminate bombardments, while others have been summarily executed. 
,  
Abd al-Wahed Hantush, a 38-year-old firefighter, lost six members of his family last October. His mother, wife and two children were killed when their car came under fire as they tried to cross from a government-controlled area back to the other side of town. His brother and sister-in-law were also killed in the incident, along with dozens of other civilians. 
,  
“They had gone to visit my sister in the al-Jura district of the city, which is under the control of government forces,” Abd al-Wahed told me. “There was no way back except through the hills on the outskirts of the city. There are often government soldiers in that area, but it was the only way.” 
,  
They never made it back. Their bodies – slaughtered and half-burned – were discovered the following day. 
,  
Abd al-Wahed’s eyes well up with tears as he shows me photographs of his five-year-old daughter, Sham, and his three-year-old son, Abderrahman, on his mobile phone. “They were all I had; I’ve lost everything,” he said. 
,  
Abd al-Wahed has cuts and burns on his face, neck, chest and arms. Four days earlier he had gone to put out a fire in a house which was hit by a rocket. 
,  
“When I got there another rocket fell and exploded very near where I was,” he says. He is lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries. Two more rockets struck the area soon afterwards. 
,  
Rockets and shells pound the city day and night, smashing into residential buildings or landing in the streets. For the civilians left in town there is little they can do to keep safe. The nights are punctuated by the thumping sound of incoming artillery and occasionally the sound of outgoing mortars fired by the armed opposition groups reverberates across the town. Everywhere, fragments of the Grad rockets fired by government forces from a hill overlooking the town litter the ground. 
,  
I visit a family with two small children who are now living in their shop in the basement of a building. “There is shelling all the time but sometimes it is unbearable. During the week of 23 May it was relentless. Batteries of 12 rockets would land in quick succession. It went on at that pace for two weeks; it was impossible to go out even to get bread,” the children’s father explained. “We avoid going out as far as we can; here we are a bit protected.” Few families have a basement in which to shelter. 
,  
A children’s playground  in one corner of the town has been converted into a cemetery. Tombstones surround the colourful slides, no longer in use as children are now kept indoors to protect them from the relentless shelling. Some of the graves belong to children who used to play there. 
,  
In one corner of the deserted playground is a particularly well-tended grave. It belongs to 11-year-old Ahmad Karjusli, who was killed on 19 October last year. Local residents tell me that the child’s mother spends every afternoon by his grave. Later that day, I find her there – alone and crying. Her mobile phone lay on the grave mound playing religious music. 
,  
“I only had two children and Ahmad was my youngest, my darling,” she tells me. “He was such a good boy. My life is empty without him. Why was he taken from me? I cannot bear the pain.” 
,  
She shows me photographs of him on her mobile phone; he looks very much like his mum. Ahmad was standing by his own front door along with a four-year-old neighbour, Abderrahman Rayyash, when a shell landed in the street and killed them both. 
,  
Everywhere in Deir Ezzour the tragedy the Syrian conflict has wrought on the ordinary lives of its residents is clear. 
,  
Even hospitals have gone underground 
,  
Even the town’s medical facilities have not been spared.  Field hospitals are set up in secret locations, to protect them from attacks by government forces. During a visit to one small and under-resourced hospital, I meet Ahmad, a 30-year-old father of three young children who is paralyzed from the waist down. 
,  
“I went out to buy milk and other things for the children and a shell landed near me in the street in the Jbala area of the city,” he says. 
,  
His spinal cord is fractured in six places. He does not know it yet, but the doctor tells me he is unlikely to ever walk again. 
,  
“There was a huge explosion and a woman standing nearby was killed on the spot. I am a civilian, not a fighter,” Ahmad says. “I used to be a mechanic but now I have not been able to work for a whole year. I cannot afford to look after my family.” 
,  
At the same hospital another doctor tells me about the many victims of the bombardments whom he has treated, and about those he could not save. Among them were his niece and nephew, a girl of 13, Nour, and her 15-year-old brother, Omar: “Two shells struck the room they were sleeping in and killed them both.” 
,  
As well as the continuous indiscriminate bombings, civilians in Deir Ezzour have also come under direct attacks. Witnesses told me how government forces in the al-Jura and al-Qusur districts of the city summarily executed scores of residents last September as they took control of the areas, flushing out armed opposition fighters. Residents, including women and children, were rounded up from the streets or seized from their homes and killed. 
, 	    
, 	On the way out of Deir Ezzour I go to the nearby town of Hatla to investigate an incident of sectarian violence in which several civilians were killed in June. 
,  
Most of the victims were from the small Shi’a Muslim community in this predominately Sunni Muslim town. Children and other civilians not involved in the conflict were among the dead. Following the incident, videos were posted online showing armed opposition fighters referring to those killed as supporters of President Bashar al-Assad. They called them “Shi’a dogs” and other derogatory terms. 
,  
Today there are no Shi’a Muslims left in Hatla. All of them fled to government-controlled areas shortly after the killings. However, the evidence left behind speaks for itself. Every single one of their homes – located in two different parts of the town – was ransacked and then blown up. The Shia mosque was likewise destroyed. Neighbours tell me that immediately after the clashes the homes were looted and some were set on fire. Indeed there is no sign of any furniture in the rubble, only a few clothes and children’s toys. The day before my visit armed opposition fighters returned to the village and blew up all the houses. 
,  
Some of the residents refuse to speak to me about the incident but the ones that do condemn these as acts of gratuitous vandalism and destruction. One tells me that many of the men in the Shi’a community co-operated with the army to plan attacks and ambushes against opposition forces. However, he too condemns the destruction of the homes of his Shi’a neighbours. 
,  
Some of the residents blame the clashes and the destruction on “extremists and foreign jihadists” seeking to incite trouble in the area. “We always lived in peace as good neighbours. Why this now? This is very wrong,” one resident says. Another resident tells me that the leader of an armed opposition group who was wounded in the clashes on 11 June had died of his wounds the previous day and that his fighters came and blew up the Shi’a residents’ homes in revenge for his death. 
,  
Both sides fall victim 
,  
It is impossible to know for certain what happened on 11 June. What seems clear is that armed clashes resulted in deaths on both sides, and that civilians from the Shi’a community were deliberately killed. I am told by residents that among the civilian victims were three elderly men, who had apparently been trying to mediate between the two sides, and at least one woman and her two children. 
,  
A few kilometres west of Hatla in the village of al-Sawa, I find the remains of another three Shi’a holy sites which were also blown up by armed fighters some 10 days earlier. There too residents blame the attacks on “radical Islamists”. These attacks seem aimed at sending a clear message to the now displaced Shi’a residents of the area that they cannot return. 
,  
As happens all too often in the Syrian conflict, it is civilians who bear the brunt of the spiralling violence. In Deir Ezzour, as elsewhere, the suffering is also hardening feeling among a civilian population who feel increasingly abandoned by the rest of the world.  When I mentioned to people in Deir Ezzour that I wanted to investigate what happened in Hatla some expressed disapproval and others discouraged me from going. Many were distinctly unsympathetic to the plight of their Shi’a neighbours and others worried that what I would discover could tarnish the image of the Syrian uprising. 
,  
Pain, loss and anger can make people blind or indifferent to the suffering of others. This is something I have come across all too often in the many conflicts and wars I have worked on over many years and Syria is no different. The longer this increasingly brutal conflict goes on, the greater the damage will be to the very fabric of Syrian society – and the harder it will be for the wounds of this conflict to heal. 
,  
This is why the inaction of the international community is all the more reprehensible. Had world leaders had the political will to overcome their divisions and put pressure on the parties involved in this conflict earlier on to resolve the crisis, many thousands of lives could have been saved. The crisis in Syria has deteriorated so far that it is today infinitely more difficult to address. But looking the other way is not the solution. A referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court by the UN Security Council would send a powerful message to those committing war crimes on all sides of the conflict, government and opposition alike. Perhaps a realistic prospect of being held accountable for their crimes could make many choose a different course of action.

As the threat of military intervention looms over an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus, in a far flung corner of Syria the town of Deir Ezzour offers an insight into the suffering of ordinary Syrians. 
 
Once a thriving hub of Syria’s oil industry, today Deir Ezzour has become a bleak microcosm of the Syrian conflict. The town, on the banks of the Euphrates River, some 450km north-east of the capital, is divided. Half is under the control of Syrian government forces and the other half is in the hands of armed opposition fighters, who also control much of the surrounding areas all the way to the Iraqi border. 
Few outsiders make it to this isolated corner of Syria. No human rights organizations and only a handful of journalists have visited the town. The opposition-controlled section of the town is the only area I can access as the Syrian government has banned Amnesty International and other human rights organizations from areas of the country under its command. The streets are eerily quiet and much of the town is in ruin. Many of the residents have fled. The empty shells of burned and bombed-out buildings line the streets – a testament to the unrelenting air strikes, artillery, mortar and tank shelling by President Bashar al-Assad’s troops. 
The only way in or out of Deir Ezzour is across a bridge which regularly comes under sniper fire from government forces. There is, unsurprisingly, little traffic. A few taxis ferry residents back and forth, driving at breakneck speed to dodge the bullets. 
Those who dare to cross – civilians and fighters alike – are often killed or injured in the process. Within two hours of my arrival in the town, I am at a local hospital, where the reality of that risk strikes home. A young man who was shot while crossing the bridge is brought in and pronounced dead almost immediately. He never stood a chance; a large calibre bullet had had left a gaping wound in his head. 
No one is safe anymore 
Everyone I meet has lost relatives and friends, many in the constant indiscriminate bombardments, while others have been summarily executed. 
Abd al-Wahed Hantush, a 38-year-old firefighter, lost six members of his family last October. His mother, wife and two children were killed when their car came under fire as they tried to cross from a government-controlled area back to the other side of town. His brother and sister-in-law were also killed in the incident, along with dozens of other civilians. 
“They had gone to visit my sister in the al-Jura district of the city, which is under the control of government forces,” Abd al-Wahed told me. “There was no way back except through the hills on the outskirts of the city. There are often government soldiers in that area, but it was the only way.” 
They never made it back. Their bodies – slaughtered and half-burned – were discovered the following day. 
Abd al-Wahed’s eyes well up with tears as he shows me photographs of his five-year-old daughter, Sham, and his three-year-old son, Abderrahman, on his mobile phone. “They were all I had; I’ve lost everything,” he said. 
Abd al-Wahed has cuts and burns on his face, neck, chest and arms. Four days earlier he had gone to put out a fire in a house which was hit by a rocket. 
“When I got there another rocket fell and exploded very near where I was,” he says. He is lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries. Two more rockets struck the area soon afterwards. 
Rockets and shells pound the city day and night, smashing into residential buildings or landing in the streets. For the civilians left in town there is little they can do to keep safe. The nights are punctuated by the thumping sound of incoming artillery and occasionally the sound of outgoing mortars fired by the armed opposition groups reverberates across the town. Everywhere, fragments of the Grad rockets fired by government forces from a hill overlooking the town litter the ground. 
I visit a family with two small children who are now living in their shop in the basement of a building. “There is shelling all the time but sometimes it is unbearable. During the week of 23 May it was relentless. Batteries of 12 rockets would land in quick succession. It went on at that pace for two weeks; it was impossible to go out even to get bread,” the children’s father explained. “We avoid going out as far as we can; here we are a bit protected.” Few families have a basement in which to shelter. 
A children’s playground  in one corner of the town has been converted into a cemetery. Tombstones surround the colourful slides, no longer in use as children are now kept indoors to protect them from the relentless shelling. Some of the graves belong to children who used to play there. 
In one corner of the deserted playground is a particularly well-tended grave. It belongs to 11-year-old Ahmad Karjusli, who was killed on 19 October last year. Local residents tell me that the child’s mother spends every afternoon by his grave. Later that day, I find her there – alone and crying. Her mobile phone lay on the grave mound playing religious music. 
“I only had two children and Ahmad was my youngest, my darling,” she tells me. “He was such a good boy. My life is empty without him. Why was he taken from me? I cannot bear the pain.” 
She shows me photographs of him on her mobile phone; he looks very much like his mum. Ahmad was standing by his own front door along with a four-year-old neighbour, Abderrahman Rayyash, when a shell landed in the street and killed them both. 
Everywhere in Deir Ezzour the tragedy the Syrian conflict has wrought on the ordinary lives of its residents is clear. 
Even hospitals have gone underground 
Even the town’s medical facilities have not been spared.  Field hospitals are set up in secret locations, to protect them from attacks by government forces. During a visit to one small and under-resourced hospital, I meet Ahmad, a 30-year-old father of three young children who is paralyzed from the waist down. 
“I went out to buy milk and other things for the children and a shell landed near me in the street in the Jbala area of the city,” he says. 
His spinal cord is fractured in six places. He does not know it yet, but the doctor tells me he is unlikely to ever walk again. 
“There was a huge explosion and a woman standing nearby was killed on the spot. I am a civilian, not a fighter,” Ahmad says. “I used to be a mechanic but now I have not been able to work for a whole year. I cannot afford to look after my family.” 
At the same hospital another doctor tells me about the many victims of the bombardments whom he has treated, and about those he could not save. Among them were his niece and nephew, a girl of 13, Nour, and her 15-year-old brother, Omar: “Two shells struck the room they were sleeping in and killed them both.” 
As well as the continuous indiscriminate bombings, civilians in Deir Ezzour have also come under direct attacks. Witnesses told me how government forces in the al-Jura and al-Qusur districts of the city summarily executed scores of residents last September as they took control of the areas, flushing out armed opposition fighters. Residents, including women and children, were rounded up from the streets or seized from their homes and killed.	   	On the way out of Deir Ezzour I go to the nearby town of Hatla to investigate an incident of sectarian violence in which several civilians were killed in June. 
Most of the victims were from the small Shi’a Muslim community in this predominately Sunni Muslim town. Children and other civilians not involved in the conflict were among the dead. Following the incident, videos were posted online showing armed opposition fighters referring to those killed as supporters of President Bashar al-Assad. They called them “Shi’a dogs” and other derogatory terms. 
Today there are no Shi’a Muslims left in Hatla. All of them fled to government-controlled areas shortly after the killings. However, the evidence left behind speaks for itself. Every single one of their homes – located in two different parts of the town – was ransacked and then blown up. The Shia mosque was likewise destroyed. Neighbours tell me that immediately after the clashes the homes were looted and some were set on fire. Indeed there is no sign of any furniture in the rubble, only a few clothes and children’s toys. The day before my visit armed opposition fighters returned to the village and blew up all the houses. 
Some of the residents refuse to speak to me about the incident but the ones that do condemn these as acts of gratuitous vandalism and destruction. One tells me that many of the men in the Shi’a community co-operated with the army to plan attacks and ambushes against opposition forces. However, he too condemns the destruction of the homes of his Shi’a neighbours. 
Some of the residents blame the clashes and the destruction on “extremists and foreign jihadists” seeking to incite trouble in the area. “We always lived in peace as good neighbours. Why this now? This is very wrong,” one resident says. Another resident tells me that the leader of an armed opposition group who was wounded in the clashes on 11 June had died of his wounds the previous day and that his fighters came and blew up the Shi’a residents’ homes in revenge for his death. 
Both sides fall victim 
It is impossible to know for certain what happened on 11 June. What seems clear is that armed clashes resulted in deaths on both sides, and that civilians from the Shi’a community were deliberately killed. I am told by residents that among the civilian victims were three elderly men, who had apparently been trying to mediate between the two sides, and at least one woman and her two children. 
A few kilometres west of Hatla in the village of al-Sawa, I find the remains of another three Shi’a holy sites which were also blown up by armed fighters some 10 days earlier. There too residents blame the attacks on “radical Islamists”. These attacks seem aimed at sending a clear message to the now displaced Shi’a residents of the area that they cannot return. 
As happens all too often in the Syrian conflict, it is civilians who bear the brunt of the spiralling violence. In Deir Ezzour, as elsewhere, the suffering is also hardening feeling among a civilian population who feel increasingly abandoned by the rest of the world.  When I mentioned to people in Deir Ezzour that I wanted to investigate what happened in Hatla some expressed disapproval and others discouraged me from going. Many were distinctly unsympathetic to the plight of their Shi’a neighbours and others worried that what I would discover could tarnish the image of the Syrian uprising. 
Pain, loss and anger can make people blind or indifferent to the suffering of others. This is something I have come across all too often in the many conflicts and wars I have worked on over many years and Syria is no different. The longer this increasingly brutal conflict goes on, the greater the damage will be to the very fabric of Syrian society – and the harder it will be for the wounds of this conflict to heal. 
This is why the inaction of the international community is all the more reprehensible. Had world leaders had the political will to overcome their divisions and put pressure on the parties involved in this conflict earlier on to resolve the crisis, many thousands of lives could have been saved. The crisis in Syria has deteriorated so far that it is today infinitely more difficult to address. But looking the other way is not the solution. A referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court by the UN Security Council would send a powerful message to those committing war crimes on all sides of the conflict, government and opposition alike. Perhaps a realistic prospect of being held accountable for their crimes could make many choose a different course of action.

Kathy Price leads AI Canada’s campaigning on human rights issues in Latin America. 
It has come to be known as “the other 9-11” – an infamy that changed the face not only of Chile but of Canada too. 
September 11 marks 40 years since a bloody military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet in Chile overthrew the democratically-elected socialist government of President Salvador Allende. The US-backed coup installed a brutal military dictatorship, unleashing years of vicious repression against anyone suspected of supporting Allende. Thousands were tortured, disappeared or murdered. The persecution, in turn, forced thousands of refugees to seek a safe haven in Canada, enriching the fabric of countless communities. 
I was a communications student at McGill University at the time and a new member of the university’s Amnesty International group. My introduction to the terror that was transforming Chile’s democracy came via an encounter I have never forgotten. As part of a university video project, I interviewed a newcomer to Montreal; Bernabe Videla Torres, a refugee from Chile. 
I remember the gentle dignity in Bernabe’s face as he told me about his work as a trade unionist in Antofagasta and how he had been imprisoned without trial and tortured. I can still hear the urgency in his voice as he explained that thousands of other Chileans were facing the same or even worse treatment at the hands of the military, their belief in social justice viewed as a disease to be obliterated by force. It was a wake-up call for Canadian action to denounce the dictatorship and protect its victims. 
Our government’s initial response was more than disappointing. Canada was among the first countries to recognize the Pinochet regime, just weeks after the military coup. To add fuel to the fire, diplomatic cables sent to Ottawa by Canada’s Ambassador in Chile, were leaked to MPs and the press, igniting concern over the ideology driving Canadian policy. In the leaked cables, our Ambassador referred to grave human rights violations by the Chilean military as “abhorrent but understandable” and described the victims as the “riff-raff of the Latin American left”. 
The uproar that ensued, together with the untiring activism of Canadian churches, trade unions, students and Amnesty members, produced positive results, opening the door to enable persecuted Chileans to find refuge in Canada. 
Thousands of Chilean asylum seekers were granted Canadian citizenship. They helped sensitize Canadian communities about ongoing repression in Chile and create a strong solidarity movement to press for change. They brought beautiful music, inspiring ideals and warm hearts. They enriched Canadian organizations with their commitment to human rights and social justice, and helped to build new ones. In Toronto, where I moved after finishing my university studies, I witnessed the dedicated contributions of exiled Chilean doctors and psychiatrists who became a moving force in a newly created centre to support traumatized survivors of torture. Chile was the poorer for losing the amazing Chileans who were forced to seek refuge in Canada during the Pinochet dictatorship. But our country benefited immensely from the influx of exiles. 
It is a lesson that seems lost on the current Canadian government, which continues to strip refugees of their rights and close the door to victims seeking a safe haven in Canada from persecution in Mexico, Colombia and other places of human tragedy. 
We would do well to reflect on these realities as we mark the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Chile. May it be the occasion to honour those whose lives were stolen from them in Chile, to  support important efforts to achieve truth and justice amidst repressive laws entrenched by the Pinochet regime  , and  to raise our voices forcefully for a Canada that upholds the rights and safety of refugees  .

,  
With over 2 million Syrian refugees having fled to neighbouring countries and well over 4 million Syrians internally displaced within the country, the crisis of displacement that has resulted from the massive human rights violations in Syria over the past 2 ½ years has been termed the gravest humanitarian emergency the world has faced in years. In the face of such a massive crisis, it is vital that Canada play a leadership role in ensuring a strong and effective global response to the pressing needs of displaced Syrians. 
,  
Canada has already made generous financial contributions in response to the crisis. As of 6 September 2013, Canada’s overall contribution of humanitarian assistance since the beginning of this year is reported to be $203 million. This support is vital. The UN has launched an unprecedented $3 billion humanitarian appeal for Syria which is, to date, underfunded by over 50%. Amnesty International encourages Canada to prepare to provide continuing and generous humanitarian support for what has clearly become a prolonged large-scale humanitarian emergency.  
,  
While financial humanitarian support to the region is vital and must continue, there is much more Canada can do in order to directly assist refugees fleeing Syria.  Refugees who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq face enormous hardship and difficulties.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable refugees, including those who have been injured and traumatized by violence and human right violations.  Additionally, the impact on communities, infrastructure and budgets in these neighbouring countries, struggling to cope with such a mass influx, has been overwhelming.  
,  
Canada can and should provide additional assistance by developing a more generous and flexible approach in its immigration and refugee policies and programs in order to facilitate increased resettlement of Syrians to Canada.  The announcement in July that 1300 Syrians would be resettled to Canada – 200 through government sponsorship and 1100 through private arrangements – is a welcome beginning.  However, Amnesty International urges Canada to go further, particularly with respect to the number of Syrians who will be accepted for resettlement through government assistance.

Additionally, Amnesty International affirms the recommendation of the UNHCR that the return of all Syrians to Syria and neighbouring countries be suspended until the country’s security and human rights situation has sufficiently improved to permit safe, dignified and sustainable return.  Canada should make it clear that, in line with the international law principle of non-refoulement, no Syrians will be forcibly returned from Canada to Syria, in any manner whatsoever. 
,  
Amnesty International calls on Canada to demonstrate leadership to other nations by committing to provide ongoing humanitarian assistance throughout the region; providing flexible and generous options for immigration to Canada for Syrians; and demonstrating that Canada has increased and will continue to increase significantly the number of government assisted resettlement spaces for Syrian refugees, above and beyond annual resettlement quotas.   Such leadership will in turn strengthen Canada’s efforts in calling on countries in the region to keep their borders open; as the prospect of borders being closed or restricted would provoke an even greater humanitarian crisis. 
,  
Canadians are deeply troubled by the gravity of the human rights and humanitarian crisis that has devastated Syria over the past 2 ½ years and have been gravely concerned about the political deadlock that has blocked international efforts to bring the crisis to an end.  That political deadlock cannot stand in the way of a generous and robust global response to the plight of Syrian refugees and should, if anything, be impetus for even greater international action.

,  
“We have no women for marriage” is Khawlah’s usual response when Jordanian or other foreign men ask about marrying her 14-year-old daughter when they come looking for a bride. 
,  
	Like other Syrian women refugees I met during a recent visit to Jordan, Khawlah – who lives in the Jordanian capital Amman – complained how Jordanian men constantly bombard her with marriage proposals or requests to arrange marriages with refugee girls.  
,  
	“I do not have work for you, but could marry you if you like,” is what ‘Aisha was told when she went looking for work. A 22-year-old student of English Literature, she complained that one of the reasons her job search in Amman has been futile so far is that she often receives marriage proposals instead of paid work. 
,  
	Other Syrian women refugees I met in Za’atri camp – Jordan’s biggest refugee camp, hosting around 130,000 people – also mentioned that some Jordanian men visit the camp looking for brides. Yet it appears that many of these men end up leaving the camp disappointed. 
,  
	The head of a community-based organization providing relief services to Syrian refugees told me that many men from the Gulf and even Europe approach him and his organization to try to arrange marriages between them and Syrian refugee women. He claims to have refused all of these requests. 
,  
 Stigmatized and harassed 
,  
	Syrian women refugees I spoke to complained that they are exposed to sexual harassment more than Jordanian women simply because of their status as refugees, which is generally associated with economic vulnerability. UN workers as well as human rights and women’s rights activists I interviewed in Jordan backed that point up. 
,  
	Indeed, some of the Syrian women refugees I spoke to mentioned that this stigmatization and harassment is making their husbands overly protective, limiting their mobility. In some cases, ensuing family tensions appear to have led to domestic violence. 
,  
	The story of Farah, a 28-year-old woman refugee from Syria and a mother of three, is an example of the problem. Farah told me that on one occasion she preferred to endure thirst for a whole day until her husband returned from work, rather than contacting the company which supplies drinking water to their neighbourhood – in Jordan drinking water must be purchased – out of fear the delivery men might harass her and her husband’s jealousy would be fuelled. 
,  
	“My husband is jealous because I get harassed all the time. The other day my children and I were followed all the way home by a Jordanian man who was pestering me to marry him. I told him, ‘Can you not see that I am married and have children? Leave me alone!’ He responded that he was willing to divorce me from my husband, if that was what it took,” she said. 
,  
 Myths and reality about early marriages 
,  
	Most of the activists and relief workers I met in Jordan blamed such harassment on media hype about “cheap Syrian brides” or “prostitutes”. Since the beginning of 2013, some news reports have been published speculating about the frequency and nature of early marriages among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Some even spoke of “marriage markets” in the Za’atri refugee camp, or matchmakers who arrange temporary marriages between young Syrian brides and suitors from the Gulf. 
,  
	However, during discussions with activists and aid workers in Jordan, it quickly became evident that the reality is much more complex than the picture that was portrayed by some news reports. 
,  
	It is true that Syrian refugee women and girls in Jordan – most of whom are from the southern Syrian governorate of Dera’a – tend to marry under the age of 18. It is also true that some Syrian refugee women and girls have married men of other nationalities such as men from Jordan and the Gulf. The brides’ young age and the perception of their inferior status as refugees put them at risk of sexual exploitation and other abuse within these marriages, some of which may be temporary. 
,  
	It is important to remember that getting married at a young age is a long-standing practice in Syria, particularly among the rural population. The refugees have simply imported this tradition to Jordan. 
,  
	Syria’s Personal Status Law allows, in some circumstances, for marriages of girls as young as 13. While we were in Jordan, my colleagues and I met a number of women refugees of different age groups who were children when they got married back in Syria. 
,  
	According to a UN Women assessment focusing on early marriages among Syrian refugees in Jordan and which was published in July 2013, social customs and family “honour” still appear to be the main motivation behind Syrians marrying off their daughters when still children – factors which appear to be more significant than their current economic deprivation and poverty. According to discussions I had with UN and aid workers, in the Za’atri camp the almost non-existent privacy due to proximity between tents, as well as widespread gang activity and the lack of security have played a significant role in the continuation of this practice by the families living there. While this reality does not mean the risks associated with the practice are any less serious, it highlights the entrenched nature of the practice and how difficult it is to combat. 
,  
 A wider custom 
,  
	Early marriages are by no means unheard of elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa region. In Jordan itself, women’s rights activists are still battling to amend the current Personal Status Law. The Jordanian law allows for girls below the age of 18 to marry if a Shari’a judge believes that it is in her “best interest”, a clause that activists believe is vaguely worded on purpose to give judges a lot of room for interpretation. 
,  
	Early marriages can violate the international law requirement that marriages be entered into “only with the free and full consent of the intending parties”. They also expose young girls, who may not be able to consent freely, to coercion and pressure from adults, exploitation and abuse and risk of early pregnancy with serious, long-lasting health consequences. 
,  
	According to statistics from the Jordanian government, most registered marriages of Syrian refugees are to other Syrians rather than people outside the refugee community. In fact, Syrian families we interviewed seemed quite offended by the suggestion that they might want to marry off their daughters to men of other nationalities. Most said that the main reason for refusing such marriages is because it is difficult to verify the background and social status of potential suitors. They also prefer to have their daughters living in the same country as them – marrying them off to someone from another country would decrease the chances of this, should they ever return to Syria. 
,  
 Unregistered marriages 
,  
	An additional problem is that many marriages among Syrian refugees, particularly in Za’atri camp, do not get registered officially. This erodes the already limited rights afforded to women in general under the Personal Status Laws in Jordan and Syria. It also seriously impacts their ability to register children and to access some services provided by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. 
,  
	Why is it that Syrian refugees either cannot or choose not to register their marriages? Some simply lack the needed documentation, but others have been so impacted by what they have been through in their flight from Syria that the protection they would gain by officially registering their marriages seemed insignificant in comparison with other more pressing needs. 
,  
	The Syrian women refugees I met had an endless list of grievances. They are traumatized, deprived and stigmatized, yet their ultimate priority remains their and their children’s survival through access to sustainable income, shelter, food and adequate medical care. Whether their marital rights were preserved or not seemed to be a trivial afterthought. 
,  
	When I explained to Huda, a 25-year-old newly wed Syrian refugee in Za’atri camp, the importance of registering her marriage officially, she asked: “Would they give us a caravan if we register our marriage?”

When I first walked into the offices of Amnesty International’s global headquarters in London, the words of the son of a farmer from Derry were written on the wall. 
	Seamus Heaney, the greatest Irish poet of his generation, whose work was acknowledged with a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995, never lost his instinctive feel for the universal rhythms of rural life, his ability to see the extraordinary in the humblest of places, and to express it with an eloquence and beauty that could make your heart stand still.  
	But Seamus was also one who believed it was the role of the artist to give a voice to those who were oppressed and ignored, who never saw a boundary between art and compassion, but rather believed that art was fundamentally driven by empathy, by a bond that links every living person. 
	In 1985 Mary Lawlor, then the chairperson of a local Amnesty International group in Dublin who would go on to become Executive Director, approached Seamus and asked him to write a piece to mark International Human Rights Day. 
	Mary gave Seamus a dossier filled with the stories of Prisoners of Conscience, women and men who had suffered torture, imprisonment and silence, the kind of women and men on whose behalf our movement has worked for the past fifty-two years. 
	Seamus was inspired to write one of his best-known poems, “From the Republic of Conscience”. 
	On my first day with Amnesty International, I noticed the framed copy of the poem in the entrance to our global offices. Nervously waiting for my new role to begin, it steadied me and reminded me of something vital to the nature of the global movement I was privileged to be joining. 
	An activist, outraged and determined, seeks out a neighbour, a poet who might find ways to amplify our demand for respect for the human rights of all. 
	She tells him the stories of other people in faraway places and he responds with a passion equal to her own. They are each inspired to take injustice personally. And they act to inspire others. 
	Seamus’ poem ends with the narrator being told that he is now an ambassador of conscience – a person who has a duty to speak out against injustice – and is warned that this duty will not end, that he will never be relieved. 
	Today, Seamus Heaney died. 
	He was a great friend to Amnesty International. He was generous in giving us his time and his energy, and most especially gifting us the extraordinary beauty and power of his words. 
	Seamus was a magnificent man. He was a true ambassador of conscience, a man whose empathy for the powerless and the marginalized was matched by his magnificent capacity to construct language which demanded a deep reflection on what it means to be human. 
	His words will continue to inspire countless generations to come, and we will miss him. Our sympathies to Seamus’ wife Marie, and his children Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann. 
	It is only fitting that we pay tribute to this legendary man of letters by remembering the words he wrote for us in 1985. 
 From the Republic of Conscience 
	I 
	When I landed in the republic of conscience	it was so noiseless when the engines stopped	I could hear a curlew high above the runway. 
	At immigration, the clerk was an old man	who produced a wallet from his homespun coat	and showed me a photograph of my grandfather. 
	The woman in customs asked me to declare	the words of our traditional cures and charms	to heal dumbness and avert the evil eye. 
	No porters. No interpreter. No taxi.	You carried your own burden and very soon	your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared. 
	II 
	Fog is a dreaded omen there but lightning	spells universal good and parents	hang swaddled infants in trees during thunderstorms. 
	Salt is their precious mineral. And seashells	are held to the ear during births and funerals.	The base of all inks and pigments is seawater. 
	Their sacred symbol is a stylised boat.	The sail is an ear, the mast a sloping pen,	the hull a mouth-shape, the keel an open eye. 
	At their inauguration, public leaders	must swear to uphold unwritten law and weep	to atone for their presumption to hold office- 
	and to affirm their faith that all life sprang	from salt in tears which the sky god wept	after he dreamt his solitude was endless. 
	III 
	I came back from that frugal republic	with my two arms the one length, the customs woman	having insisted my allowance was myself. 
	The old man rose and gazed into my face	and said that was official recognition	that I was now a dual citizen. 
	He therefore desired me when I got home	to consider myself a representative	and to speak on their behalf in my own tongue. 
	Their embassies, he said, were everywhere	but operated independently	and no ambassador would ever be relieved.

,  
As the humanitarian and human rights crisis caused by Syria’s internal armed conflict shows no signs of abating, two important announcements made this week help us to take stock of the enormity of the suffering of those fleeing the fighting, and what can be done to help. 
,  
In the space of 24 hours, the UN announced that the number of refugees from Syria had officially surpassed 2 million and Sweden’s Migration Board stated it would grant permanent residency status to persons from Syria seeking asylum on Swedish territory. 
,  
This is surely a balm for the thousands of Syrians who have fled to Sweden, weary of the war that evolved after the protests of early 2011 and has raged ever since. 
,  
Previously the Scandinavian country had granted permanent residency to around half of the asylum-seekers from Syria on its territory. The other half had been granted three-year temporary residence permits. 
,  
Already, on 30 January 2012, the Swedish Migration Board officially stopped all deportations to Syria. 
,  
Now, as asylum seekers become permanent residents of Sweden, their family members will also be able to apply for family reunification. 
,  
While Amnesty International warmly welcomes Sweden’s move to protect Syria’s refugees, other countries in the European Union, and elsewhere, can and should do much more. 
,  
The organization has long lobbied EU states to take measures to assist the massive numbers of people who have fled Syria – now overwhelmingly found in Syria’s neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. 
,  
In contrast, the 27 countries of the European Union, with a combined population of more than 500 million, provided protection status in 2012 to a combined total of 18,700 refugees from Syria. More than 70 per cent of these were recorded in only two countries – Germany and Sweden. 
,  
It is essential that the international community act with determination to share responsibility for Syria’s refugees. There must be a significant increase in support to the neighbouring countries which receive the bulk of the refugees, and neighbouring countries must keep their borders open to all those fleeing the conflict. 
,  
At the same time, more countries should follow Sweden’s example to ensure that people fleeing Syria are protected and offered paths to begin new lives in safe surroundings. 
,  
On the heels of the Swedish announcement, UK Prime Minister David Cameron stated that his country would “lead the world” in the Syria relief effort. Germany has already agreed to take another 5,000 individuals from Syria via a humanitarian admission programme. 
,  
These initiatives form a crucial part of what will be needed to stem the tide of suffering for civilians caught up in the Syrian conflict. However, two-and-a-half years after the crisis in Syria began, with almost a third of the country’s population displaced internally or in other countries, such offers of assistance must be followed through promptly and replicated widely. 
,  
Amnesty International will continue to urge all states in a position to aid Syrian refugees to do all they can in the face of one of the worst displacement crises in recent history.

Amnesty International will continue to urge all states in a position to aid Syrian refugees to do all they can in the face of one of the worst displacement crises in recent history.

	Capital Pride in Ottawa drew to a close on Sunday, and Amnesty International played a key role in this year’s festivities. 
	A team of members and staff partnered with Capital Pride to organize several events, including a successful and well-attended Human Rights Vigil and an action outside the Jamaican High Commission calling on the Jamaican government to respond to the death of Dwayne Jones last month and work to prevent future violence against LGBTI individuals. 
	Maurice Tomlinson, a leading Jamaican LGBTI rights activist and lawyer, and his partner, Tom Decker, spoke at both events about their work in the Caribbean. Maurice spoke about the impact of anti-sodomy laws in Jamaica, where homophobic violence is common and the laws prevent people at risk from accessing protection. Tom, a pastor and former police officer, spoke about the rise of evangelical Christianity in the region and its negative impact on human rights protection for LGBTI communities. They also partnered with Amnesty to host a screening of the film The Abominable Crime, which tells the stories of LGBTI Jamaicans, including Maurice. It was wonderful to have Maurice and Tom present to share their stories with our LGBTI community here in Ottawa, and it added a valuable dimension that is often missing from our Pride celebrations. 
	The Human Rights Vigil included speeches from Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson on the City’s commitment to protecting the rights of its LGBTQI citizens; local trans activist Amanda Ryan on the struggle for human rights protections for trans people in Canada; and filmmaker Leslie Foster, director of the documentary Until We Have Faces (http://www.travelingmuse.com/current-projects.html). I was also invited to speak on behalf of Amnesty International about the state of LGBTI human rights around the world. 
	The week wrapped up with the parade and festival on Sunday. Amnesty had a large contingent marching in the parade, and our tent at the festival was so popular that we ran out of petitions!

In January, a group of people gathered in St. Petersburg for a snowball fight. The police responded by banning it and dispersing the crowd, calling it an “unauthorized gathering.” 
This is not a joke. This actually happened. 
In May, a group of activists supporting the human rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) community, staged a peaceful protest in Moscow against homophobic laws. They were beaten by counter-protestors while police stood by. And then the victims—the LGBTI activists—were arrested by the police. 
On June 30th, Russia passed a homophobic law, which violates both its own constitution and international human rights treaties, and discriminates against the LGBTI community. Under the law, “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” is banned. What this means is that members of Russia’s LGBTI community are being firmly pushed back into the closet, and risk fines and jail time for such things as promoting sexual health for LGBTI youth, or kissing their partner in public. 
International outcry against this legislation continues to mount—as it should. Sadly, the homophobic law is not the only egregious and rights-violating law to be recently passed. 
Ever since Vladimir Putin returned to office as Russia’s President he has introduced laws that: 
· severely limit freedom of assembly; 
· stigmatize the LGBTI community; 
· criminalize insulting the feelings of believers; and 
· broaden the definitions of treason and espionage so that human rights activism could potentially be criminalized. 
In practical terms this means that the space for freedom of assembly, association, and expression in Russia is rapidly shrinking. You can’t be openly out of the closet. You can’t easily organize a protest or public event of any sort. And it’s incredibly difficult to operate an NGO, and in particular to receive foreign funding. 
The Winter Olympics are being held in Sochi, Russia, from February 7-23, 2014. Amnesty International believes that with the spotlight on Russia, we can bring visibility to the restrictions being placed on civil society, and take action in solidarity with our fellow activists who continue to carry out their work, often at great personal risk, from within Russia. 
Sign our petition and call on President Putin to end the attack on civil society. 
Stay tuned to our website for creative actions that you can take in the lead-up to the Sochi Winter Olympics. 
Take action to help make sure that people can be out and loud and proud both in Sochi and every single day in Russia. Take action to support the upholding of basic human rights—in the meantime, we can assume there won’t be any snowball fights in Sochi…

By Audrey Gaughran, Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International 
I have just left Katanga in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where my colleague Lisa Tassi and I were following up on Amnesty International’s work on mining and human rights in the region. 
In some ways this is easy to do. Besides mining – mostly of copper and cobalt – precious little happens in southern Katanga. But two very different methods are employed to extract these minerals. Industrial mining, involving large multinational companies, is managed from air-conditioned offices and carried out with heavy equipment; small-scale artisanal mining is frequently done in sweltering heat by men (and in some cases boys under the age of 18) working with basic tools. 
Artisanal mining can be a desperate business. On top of suffering harsh work conditions, many creuseurs – meaning “diggers”, as the miners are known locally – are ruthlessly exploited by traders who buy from them along a largely opaque supply chain. In theory the state has some oversight of the system, but the reality is quite different. 
 
Earlier this year Amnesty International published a report exposing the horrendous conditions at an artisanal mining site in Katanga called Tilwezembe. One of the things we tried to unravel on our return visit is where minerals from sites such as Tilwezembe actually end up. Traders are key to that process. 
But the supply chain to take the minerals mined by creuseurs out of Katanga is complex.  It operates with virtually no oversight, and no meaningful paper trail to enable minerals to be tracked from source to export. 
Katanga’s mineral traders include individuals who buy and sell as well as separate trading companies, some of which also process ore. In some cases, creuseurs work at mine sites controlled by these trading companies. The state (or the state mining company, Gécamines) gives these companies control, but seems to impose few safeguards. And so the creuseurs working the site – often through a deal between the trader and an artisanal mining cooperative – are obliged to sell directly to the trading company, with no system in place to ensure they get a fair price. 
Creuseurs, who may work underground for many hours each day, regularly report that they feel cheated by this system where they have to take what they are offered with no way to challenge the traders. Because they must survive, they have no choice but to accept these unfair terms of business. 
There is also very little done to ensure safety at the artisanal mine sites, and every year scores of creuseurs are killed or seriously injured. Although SAESSCAM – the government agency charged with training and assisting artisanal miners – is generally present at these sites, it has insufficient resources and limited power. 
We have been trying this last week to find out what happens to the copper and cobalt that is mined in such terrible conditions. Much of it goes to China, but who buys it and can we talk to them? The answer is no, because Katanga’s byzantine trading pipeline makes it almost impossible to track ore as it changes hands from an artisanal mine site to a trader to a processor and on to export, let alone track it to the final destination. 
In Kolwezi, a centre for much of the copper and cobalt trade, we visited a depot where dozens of traders (Congolese and foreign) buy from creuseurs who arrive with sacks of minerals on bikes. Some of the creuseurs tell us that no questions are asked here – they bring, they sell; no-one who buys from them knows where the ore comes from. They do not, themselves, have any way to measure the concentration of the ore they have mined. And so they accept the price. But they tell us that here, at least, they are free to offer their ore to a range of traders and sell to the highest bidder. 
By contrast, creuseurs working on sites controlled by trading companies face a monopoly. One man we met at the Kolwezi depot told us he worked on a site controlled by a trader and had smuggled out some ore to sell at the depot, as the price on site was too little for the hours of work and he felt he was not getting a fair deal. 
We talked to some of the buyers at one of the depot’s many trading stalls – in this case a group of Chinese and Congolese who had erected a makeshift desk, and had a scale, a calculator and a box of cash. They were none too happy to see us, and they politely – but firmly – evaded our queries about where the ore comes from and goes to. It comes from all over Katanga and goes to various processing companies, they say. There is no paperwork that we can see – and when we ask about a paper trail, the traders will not answer. 
The traders sell to others inside Katanga where the ore is processed (or not) before being sent out of the country, often by the truckload across the Zambian border. Export paperwork gets filled out and filed, but by this stage in the process the origin of the minerals has already been obscured. 
The life of a creuseur is harsh. The Congolese authorities can – and must – do more to protect people from exploitative and harmful working conditions. But those who buy the ore along the supply chain can also make a difference, if they insist on knowing from which sites the ore or minerals come and the conditions on site and the conditions under which it continues to be traded. Key questions need to be asked and information verified. However, this kind of due diligence is impossible if there is no proper recording and oversight, and if traders can buy and export without anyone being able to tell if the minerals are extracted in appalling conditions. 
In other parts of the DRC, including the Kivus, Maniema and northern Katanga, a system has been put in place for tracing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and building documentation. If it can be done in these areas, then why not extend the programme to Katanga’s cobalt and copper sector? 
Efforts to ensure fair work conditions for creuseurs have to take account of the fact that there is practically no other livelihood on offer to many Katanga residents. The answer is not to prevent artisanal mining but to make it a safer and fairer business until longer-term solutions are found.

US President Obama offered a tepid response on government surveillance at last Friday’s news conference in Washington. 
Yes, he pledged his support for efforts to revamp the procedures of the secret court that authorizes the surveillance, and that initiative is important. He also released the government’s legal analysis for its bulk collection of every domestic phone call, and more generally committed to greater transparency in the National Security Agency (NSA)’s work. 
But we need more than just “tightening the bolts,” as the President put it. 
Privacy is a human right. It’s guaranteed by treaties the United States is party to and affirmed in international standards the country helped develop. 
The state can take steps that interfere with privacy if doing so is necessary to protect other rights, but its actions have to be proportionate to the aim it’s seeking to achieve. And it has to justify its actions. 
There’s no question of the breathtaking extent of the government’s surveillance of telephone and internet communication infringes on privacy. 
To start with, there’s the programme that collects records of every domestic phone call. These records don’t include the content of the calls themselves, but the “telephony metadata” that are scooped up reveal a lot about our daily activities: who we call, when, for how long and how often, and where we are when we place those calls, if they go through cell towers. This is already a lot of information about how we each go about our daily lives. 
In addition, earlier last week, the New York Timesreported that the NSA is examining all email messages that come into and out of the United States. The purpose is to locate information associated with terrorism or counterintelligence. That’s a legitimate aim, of course, but the methods the NSA employs apparently mean that it’s conducting a blanket search of every email message that enters or leaves a US-based server. 
In fact, thanks to Edward Snowden’s disclosures to The Guardian and the Washington Post, we know that the NSA’s surveillance programmes allow NSA analysts to search and read nearly everything the typical internet user does online. Emails, video, photos, video and voice calls, chats, file transfers, social networking details, and other information are open for scrutiny. 
One programme, Prism, reportedly gives the NSA a backdoor entry to major social networking, data storage and transfer, and email providers. 
And a leaked NSA presentation of another programme, XKeyscore, states that it allows NSA analysts to search and read the content of emails, Facebook chats, private messages, and other social media activities as well as browser history and “every email address seen in a session by both username and domain,” “every phone number seen in a session (e.g. address book entries or signature block),” and other user activity – “username, buddylist, machine specific cookies.” 
So what’s the government’s justification? The administration defends the bulk collection of telephony metadata by saying that the content of the calls isn’t monitored or recorded. In fact, government lawyers argue – and the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has so far agreed – that warrants aren’t required for this activity because people don’t have a privacy interest in the phone numbers and the other details of the calls they make. 
That’s a convenient conclusion for those who want to conduct surveillance without basic legal safeguards, but it isn’t a reasonable one. Most people probably don’t want the state to collect information that enables it to assemble a detailed picture of their daily activities and network of contacts, at least not without a specific and individualized reason. 
As for the other programmes, which unabashedly do give NSA analysts access to the content of our communications, the government’s rationale is even flimsier. Some of the programmes only target communications that the agency “reasonably believes” – with 51 percent certainty – to involve a “non-US person.” That’s no comfort to those of us who don’t live in the United States. 
Ultimately, instead of attempting to make a showing – in advance and to the public – that its surveillance measures are necessary and proportionate, the government’s explanation boils down to “trust us.” 
That’s true even after President Obama’s recent remarks: “To others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people,” he said. 
In addition to the modest steps he’s backed, we need much more. The Justice Department needs to revisit the facile conclusions its lawyers have reached. 
The surveillance court should release unclassified versions of its decisions. And Congress must act to close the legal loopholes that have enabled such a potentially massive intrusion into our private lives.

Roger Plant joined Amnesty International in 1972 to cover the organization’s work on Latin America. A few months after Pinochet took power by force, he went to Chile to document the arbitrary detentions, torture and disappearances. The result was a groundbreaking report that helped shine a light on the reality of life in the Latin-American country. 
As a young researcher, Roger Plant had only been working for Amnesty International for less than a year when Augusto Pinochet launched his coupe d’état in 1973. With his feet barely under the desk it was a baptism of fire – a seminal moment that would eventually define his career. 
“The day of the coup I was in London. I was at home when I was called and we rushed into immediate action. I remember very quickly contacting the various Chilean friends and contacts trying to get a picture together of what was happening,” he explained. 
A few months later, he was sat on a plane at London’s Heathrow airport bound for Santiago de Chile via New York. Following a phone conversation with Amnesty International’s General Secretary, the late Martin Ennals, he was still unsure if he would be allowed into the country. 
 
 
“Martin Ennals wanted us to go as soon as we could. I remember at Heathrow airport there was a message for me and I called Martin and he said ‘Roger, we heard from the Foreign Minister that the delegation will not be allowed to enter Chile, you will never be able to go ahead.” I got on the plane slightly disturbed and when I got to New York I contacted Martin and he said ‘I’m glad to say that the Chileans have changed their minds and you will be allowed in after all.’” 
This was the first visit to monitor the illegal detentions, torture and disappearances that were taking place in the Latin-American country under General Pinochet’s brutal regime. 
 
Entering unfriendly territory	But entering a country in the midst of a human rights crisis, as thousands of social activists, dissidents, teachers, lawyers and trade unionists were being rounded up, detained, tortured and disappeared was no simple task. 
As part of a team of three, Roger crossed Santiago’s airport doors with Frank Newman, a law professor in the University of California, and Judge Bruce Sandler, presiding Judge of the Supreme Court of Orange County, California. 
While the Chilean authorities had agreed to the visit, it was to be strictly controlled. The security services would try to prevent the team from gaining access to the very places that they wanted to see. Those centres that would later become renowned for the abuses that defined Pinochet’s 17 year rule. Roger and his colleagues gave their minders the slip. 
“It was a terrible situation. Within a couple of days I was inside the National Stadium, which was by then being emptied,” Roger recalls. 
“They tried very hard not to let us go. We [were] ‘guided’ by some Chilean government officials but I remember getting away from them and being able talk to some of the political prisoners. It was a very strange situation. On the one hand, there can be a great deal of control, but on the other there can be a certain amount of chaos in a situation like that. 
 
Victims and abusers	Over an eight day visit, the Amnesty International delegates met with dozens of torture survivors, relatives of activists who had been detained, and even government officials who tried to justify the abuses that were taking place. 
“I remember being shown some very severe signs of torture. I was given a list of people [who had been detained] that we circulated as quickly as we could afterwards. It was all very quick because we were running around getting as much information as we could but knowing that the military was going to be coming along, pushing you, stopping you, moving you along as quickly as possible.” 
“It was a mix of talking to some very brave people who were working directly with the political prisoners and talking to some of the government officials like the Foreign Minister, the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Justice. And we were also talking to a number of the diplomats who were also doing everything they could to intervene on behalf of those who were at risk.” 
The accounts they received from activists and government representatives were completely opposed. 
“It was extremely depressing to meet with the entire general council of the Bar Association which was absolutely denying everything, justifying everything. And as we found out over 90% of the prisoners and prisons were under the control of the Ministries of Defence and Interior. So, what you had was a façade of justice.” 
 
The report	Roger returned to London after eight days in Chile to write one of the first reports that documented the shocking abuses taking place under Pinochet’s rule. 
The document included dozens of testimonies of arbitrary detentions, torture and disappearances and sparked a global call for action. It catapulted an international campaign to help those at risk. 
“Pinochet was getting a fair amount of support in the US at that time but everything in Chile was completely overwhelmed by the military who were keeping a state of siege . There was no rule of law whatsoever – it was just a façade.”

On the morning of July 31st, I woke up to messages of hope and optimism spread across my Facebook feed, my morning news, and my inbox. Many of my friends in Zimbabwe had posted statuses and updates about the elections that day, which would determine the composition of the House of Commons and the Senate as well as the future President of Zimbabwe. 
Very few incidents of violence were reported during or immediately after the elections. The chief of the African Union monitoring mission, Olusegun Obasanjo, stated that although “there are incidences that could have been avoided…we do not believe that these incidents will amount to the results not reflecting the will of the people.” Shortly before the announcement of a landslide victory for Robert Mugabe, who is reported to have captured 61% of the vote, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-T) announced that the election was a “huge farce.” He has since mounted a legal challenge of the election results and is now discussing a boycott of all government institutions. 
While President Jacob Zuma of South Africa congratulated the President on his re-election, many Western nations, including Canada and the United States, added their concerns to those of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN). ZESN, a non-governmental organization based in Zimbabwe, fielded approximately 6,000 accredited observers and has made numerous criticisms of the electoral process. 
For starters, ZESN says, the electoral roll was made publicly available only two days before the poll, meaning that there was little time to verify voters’ names and eliminate duplications. It has been reported that nearly 1 million people were prevented from casting ballots due to irregularities in the voters’ roll. The African Union also reported that more than 8 million ballots were printed, far exceeding the 6.4 million ballots needed to fulfill the needs of registered voters and disregarding international best practice. 
There have been further allegations that many voters, particularly in rural areas, were forced to pretend that they were illiterate or ill, meaning that they were required to cast their ballot with assistance from election officials. Amnesty International has recently issued a press release highlighting the plight of at least six women political activists who have reported fleeing their homes with their families after facing intimidation from village heads in Mashonaland Central Province. The families reported that they were targeted for their support—real or perceived—for the MDC. 
Political harassment has affected many members of civil society as well; Magodonga Mahlangu, one of the leaders of Women of Zimbabwe Arise! (WOZA), the popular grassroots activism movement, was arrested on August 6th in Bulawayo and accused of threatening an MDC-T Ward Chairwoman, Gladys Dube. According to WOZA, a flyer was distributed in a Bulawayo suburb that spoke ill of the MDC-T and was falsely affiliated with WOZA in an attempt to discredit their impartial and apolitical status. It has also been reported by WOZA that Gladys Dube and other MDC-T members went to the houses of three WOZA members to threaten them with retribution before reporting WOZA members to the police. Any kind of politically motivated policing violates the rights of Zimbabweans to freedom of peaceful expression and association. 
Political violence during the 2008 presidential elections resulted in approximately 200 people killed and tens of thousands displaced. Thankfully, this year’s elections have not resulted in the same tragic headlines. However, allegations of vote rigging should be taken seriously and thoroughly examined. Zimbabweans deserve more than hopeful posts on Facebook accounts. Zimbabweans deserve a government that is transparent, accountable, and responsive to their needs.

In her carefully reasoned judgment, Justice Brown affirmed that claims brought by 13 Guatemalan Indigenous people against Canadian company HudBay Minerals and its subsidiaries should be permitted to go to trial. HudBay and its subsidiaries had attempted to prevent the claims from going forward, arguing that a parent corporation can never be held liable for murder, shootings and rapes allegedly committed by security personnel employed by a Guatemalan subsidiary. 
This decision means that four years after her husband’s death, Angelica Choc will be able to tell Canadians her family’s tragic story and seek justice for the brutal killing of her husband, Adolfo Ich.  It means that 11 Maya-Q’eqchi’ women who were allegedly raped by security personnel working for the Canadian company’s subsidiary will be able to have their day in court. And it means that the 13th plaintiff, German Chub, who was shot and paralyzed on the day Adolfo Ich was killed, will be able to tell a Canadian judge what happened to him and how his life has been changed forever. 
Amnesty International had intervened at the hearing in March 2013, when the companies tried to stop the claims from going forward. At the hearing, Amnesty International – represented by lawyers Paul Champ and Penelope Simons – argued that a parent company may owe a duty of care to people who might be harmed by the conduct of its subsidiary companies. Legally speaking, in Canada, individuals and corporations have an obligation to take reasonable care to avoid conduct that entails an unreasonable risk of harm to others. In light of international standards on corporate behaviour, AI argued that a reasonable parent corporation would inform itself of the human rights risks associated with operating in a conflict-affected area such as Guatemala, and conduct itself in accordance with these norms. 
By ruling that cases can proceed, this judgment represents a major victory for these particular plaintiffs – who will have a chance to prove their claims in Canadian court – and also for the larger struggle to ensure that Canadian corporations respect international human rights standards, wherever they operate.

Those were the sad words of a tenacious local human rights defender as we drove past the ruins of the Nahibly displaced persons camp just outside the town of Duékoué in western Côte d’Ivoire in late February of this year.  The Nahibly Camp, which was home to over 2,500 people, had been totally destroyed seven months earlier, on July 20, 2012, in a massive attack by a mob estimated at 1,000, led by local Dozo militias and including members of the national army.  At least 14 people – almost certainly more – were killed during the attack. Hundreds more were injured. Many more were rounded up and ‘disappeared’ as they fled the camp. Six bodies have since been found in a nearby well but many others are still missing.  
I have travelled to the area as part of two Amnesty International research missions – in September 2012 and February 2013 – and have heard firsthand from survivors of this terrible attack and family members of people who have not been heard of since.  They expressed fear, worry and a determination that there be answers and accountability.  Today we are releasing this new report, marking the first anniversary of the Nahibly attack.  With this report we are joining the voices of survivors and families in demanding truth and justice.  In particular we are calling for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to get to the bottom of what happened.  Nature may be reclaiming the site of this human rights tragedy.  But we cannot and will not forget the human rights violations that took place there.

Twelve kilometres south of the border with Syria lies the Za’atri refugee camp in Jordan. Over 130,000 refugees, who have fled the conflict in Syria, live here in a 7km-wide stretch on this otherwise lifeless desert plain, in a mix of makeshift emergency tents and mobile homes or “caravans”. 
In the blinding sunlight, a young woman wearing a black abaya squeezes herself and a baby into a half-metre strip of shade beside a white wall. Dust clouds, kicked up by the wind or passing lorries, sweep across the barren landscape. 
Some show us the battered and broken shoes and sandals in which they made the arduous trek to Jordan. 
	The vast majority of refugees we meet have fled from the southern governorate of Dera’a, where mass protests calling for change in Syria first began more than two years ago. 
“They arrested me because I wanted freedom,” says Ahmed softly, struggling to catch his breath. He is sitting cross-legged in his family’s “caravan”. As he talks, his young son flicks through mobile-phone video-clips of Syrian security forces beating and stamping on handcuffed men. Ahmed has a heart condition, worsened by nearly two years in detention during which he says he was tortured. I ask if I can take notes about his detention and ill-treatment, but his eyes glaze over and his head sinks forward. I decide not to take out my notebook. 
A woman in her 30s in the same caravan, Wafa, says her baby died several months ago in an under-resourced hospital in Dera’a. She is still mourning the loss of her child. “There was only one doctor there, and the baby needed oxygen. There was none. The baby died,” she says. 
While many clearly oppose the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his security forces, others appear indifferent. Abu Hamza, a driver, now lives with his family in a dusty canvas tent. “I didn’t go to protests. I’m not political,” he says. “We left because of the shelling and the sniping”. 
Here the family faces new problems. “There’s not enough water. The toilets are too far away. My children have only been to school two or three times. They’re bored and fed up. Of course there is no work here. I’ve not left Za’atri in our three months here. Where would I go?” 
Za’atri is now the second-largest refugee camp in the world.  However, most refugees from Syria are staying in private, rented accommodation. Many others have fled to other neighbouring countries: Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. 
And the flow is increasing. According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, the number of refugees fleeing Syria has topped one million so far this year – more than the number of new refugees worldwide in the whole of 2012. 
And many are preparing for the long haul. Hundreds of shops are said to have sprung up across the camp, selling phonecards, wedding clothes and Arabic sweets. 
Despite the dire conditions a young family extends their generosity and invites us into their tent. “I wish I could invite you into the beautiful house we had back home,” says Dina, one camp resident with a sad smile. They are making every effort to make this their home. At the end of the tent, brown water swirls in a small washing machine. 
The camp is disorganized and living conditions are clearly challenging. Electricity cables are tapped into, triggering shortages and protests. Many refugees are traumatized, frustrated and angry. Most are young and have little to do. Low-level crime is a growing problem. Fifty-five water taps were fitted one day and within an hour they were stolen, we were told, and even the camp’s police station was dismantled and carried away in parts. 
With no end in sight to the conflict in Syria it seems that the refugees in Za’atri and elsewhere have a long wait ahead before they can return to their country. While Jordan has, to its credit, mostly kept its borders open to the large-scale refugee influx, it is not a resource-rich country. The international community must agree to resettle vulnerable refugees and ensure that Jordan and other host countries have the financial and technical resources to protect and assist refugees from Syria, until they can finally go home.

0,Canadian Test for Exclusion Brought into Line with International Law,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-canadian-test-exclusion-brought-line-international-law/,"On 19 July 2013, Amnesty International welcomed an important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in the case of Rachidi Ekanza Ezokola.  The unanimous judgment, written by Justices LeBel and Fish, brings Canada’s interpretation of the UN Refugee Convention into line with international...","On 19 July 2013, Amnesty International welcomed an important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in the case of Rachidi Ekanza Ezokola.  The unanimous judgment, written by Justices LeBel and Fish, brings Canada’s interpretation of the UN Refugee Convention into line with international law. 
by Anna Shea and Gloria Nafziger 
Mr. Ezokola had a long career with the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In 2008 he resigned from his position at the Permanent Mission of the DRC at the UN in New York and fled to Canada with his family, seeking refugee protection.  He stated that he could no longer work for a government which he considered corrupt, violent and antidemocratic.  
The Immigration and Refugee Board determined that he was prevented from claiming refugee status, because having been employed by a government that committed terrible crimes rendered him complicit in those atrocities. There has never been any allegation that Mr. Ezokola was personally responsible for any crimes, nor that he made statements intended to minimize or camouflage the criminal activity of the Congolese government. Mr. Ezokola’s case eventually made it to the SCC. 
Amnesty International intervened at the SCC hearing in January 2013, and was represented by lawyers Michael Bossin, Laïla Demirdache, and Chantal Tie, with assistance from Anna Shea. Amnesty International argued that Canadian law, which excludes people who are not in any way connected with the commission of international crimes, is unfair, overly broad and out of line with the human rights purpose of the Refugee Convention. 
Exclusion from refugee status is a complex issue. The Refugee Convention is a human rights instrument, designed to protect people fleeing persecution. Therefore, individuals who contribute towards persecution – such as people who commit crimes against humanity – should not be allowed to exploit the refugee protection system to their advantage. Another complicating factor is that exclusion decisions are made in the context of a refugee hearing – not in a criminal trial in which guilt or innocence is determined. The difficulty is how to develop a fair and workable test for determining when someone should be prevented from claiming refugee status. 
In Amnesty International’s view, the SCC has succeeded in doing so, and has brought Canada’s interpretation of the Refugee Convention into line with international law. The decision sends a clear message that Canadian decision-makers have been too keen to exclude refugee claimants. Under the new, stricter test, “an individual will be excluded from refugee protection under art. 1F(a) for complicity in international crimes if there are serious reasons for considering that he or she voluntarily made a knowing and significant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of the group alleged to have committed the crime.” In other words, it is not enough to simply belong to a group that commits criminal offences; it is necessary to voluntarily and knowingly make a significant contribution to those crimes. 
Amnesty International is hopeful that this decision will bring some much-needed clarity and fairness to Canada’s jurisprudence on exclusion, and lend support to a growing international trend towards a more restrictive application of the Refugee Convention’s exclusion clauses.

,  
While the world is focusing on the political fall-out of millions of people taking to the streets in Egypt, with widespread calls for the resignation of President Mohamed Morsi, and the army taking over, other stomach-turning developments have passed virtually unnoticed: Women and girls protesting in the vicinity of Tahrir Square are, time and time again, being sexually attacked by mobs, with authorities remaining idle. 
,  
	This is not a new phenomenon. 
,  
	Testimonies from women caught up in the demonstrations, survivors from previous protests and those trying to help, point to a horrific chain of events: tens if not hundreds of men surround their victims, tearing-off their clothes and veils, unzipping trousers, groping breasts and backsides. Sticks, blades and other weapons are frequently used in such attacks. 
,  
	The mob attacks of the last two days are tragic repeats on a larger scale of similar incidents during previous major protests including against President Morsi’s Constitutional Declaration in November 2012 and protests commemorating the second anniversary of the “25 January Revolution” in January 2013. 
,  
	The repetition of these frightening attacks over the weekend is yet another stark reminder of how successive Egyptian governments, including President Morsi’s, have failed to address gender-based violence and discrimination. 
,  
 Dozens of new attacks reported 
,  
On 30 June, Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault (OpAntiSH), an initiative by a number of Egyptian human rights organizations, groups and individuals set-up to combat sexual harassment and assaults, received reports of 46 cases of violent sexual attacks against women in the vicinity of Tahrir Square. At the Presidential Palace, the “I saw Harassment” initiative reported yet another case. Amnesty International believes the real numbers are likely to be much higher. 
,  
	Attacks in the vicinity of Tahrir Square were first reported around 6pm, continuing late into the night. According to information available to Amnesty International, at least one survivor had to undergo surgery as a result of the attacks, and several more were left in need of medical attention. 
,  
	OpAntiSH activists along with volunteers from Tahrir Bodyguard, another group seeking to put an end to all forms of sexual harassment of women, sought to intervene to get survivors to safety. Their hotlines did not stop ringing into the early hours of the morning; at times their attempts to help were hindered by prank offensive calls. 
,  
	Rescuing women from attacks came at great personal risk as many volunteers were beaten and attacked with blades and other weapons. One of the volunteers was reported to have suffered concussion after receiving a heavy blow to the head, while others received stitches. 
,  
	The attacks were not restricted to the 30 June. By midnight on the second day of the mass protests, OpAntiSH reported 17 further cases of sexual assaults, including elderly women and girls as young as seven. On 03 July OpAntiSH received about 25 reports of attempted sexual harassment or assaults where one needed psychological intervention. The volunteers and bystanders intervened for the rest. 
,  
	Attacks already started in the build-up to the mass demonstrations of 30 June. Two days before, the Nazra for Feminist Studies, a group that aims to build a feminism movement in Egypt, received information on 12 cases of sexual assaults on women in the vicinity of the Square; including cases where women were hospitalized. 
,  
All words, no real action to protect women 
,  
When news of similar attacks started to emerge earlier this year, some officials including the Prime Minister were quick to condemn them with the promise of new legislation on violence against women. Sadly, these steps by the authorities seem to be nothing more than an attempt to deflect criticism, including from the international community. 
,  
	The National Council of Women sent a draft law on violence against women to the President and the Prime Minister in mid-June but nothing seems to have changed. 
,  
	In May, without any consultation with women’s rights groups and activists, it was announced that a special all female unit had been established under the Ministry of Interior to address sexual harassment and violence against women. However, they were nowhere to be seen in the past few days. Meanwhile, volunteers and human rights activists attempted to try to fill the vacuum created by the state’s failure; working tirelessly to get women and girls to safety and provide them with much needed medical, psychological and legal support. 
,  
“They brought it upon themselves” 
,  
The government has also failed to address the deep-seated discriminatory discourse and attitudes reverberating across society that blames women for the attacks they suffered. 
,  
	Following the emergence of testimonies of mob sexual assaults on women, members of the Shura Council, Egypt’s Upper House of Parliament, said in February 2013 women had brought the attacks upon themselves by attending the protests. 
,  
	Women should not mingle with men during demonstrations, they claimed. 
,  
Playing politics with the issue of sexual violence against women 
,  
After the latest horrific incidents, prominent members of the Muslim Brotherhood publicized the sexual assaults on social media. Channels known for their support of the President leapt at the opportunity to “prove” that his opponents are nothing but “thugs” and “criminals”. On 29 June, the Office of the President’s assistant on foreign relations issued a statement in English – clearly targeting the international community – pointing to sexual attacks on women by his opponents compared to the “peaceful” protests held by his supporters. 
,  
	It seems the President’s office is quick to respond to cases which may bring international condemnation. His spokesperson indicated on 30 June that steps are being taken in relation to the rape of a foreign woman journalist. 
,  
	It is a different story for Egyptian women sexually assaulted on the streets. The Muslim Brotherhood’s newfound concern for violence against women is a far cry from its statement in March described a UN declaration calling for an end to violence against women as the destruction of “family life and entire society”. 
,  
	Opponents of the President are also not free from blame. They called for mass mobilization of protests, yet despite precedents, they failed to raise awareness or to speak out against sexual assaults. 
,  
A call to action 
,  
What is needed today is not political score-settling, but real action. Crimes against all survivors must be independently, impartially and fully investigated with a view of bringing those responsible to justice. 
,  
	And past actions speak louder than words. Seven survivors of sexual assaults in the vicinity of Tahrir Square during previous protests in November 2012 and January 2013 lodged a complaint with the public prosecution in March. While investigations were initiated, they have now stalled and nobody has been held to account. A lawyer working on the case told Amnesty International that a prosecutor described the case as “not being a priority” given the other more “serious crimes” he had to investigate. 
,  
	This dismissive attitude, along with attempts to justify the attacks, does nothing but reinforce entrenched society’s attitudes which put women’s lives at risk. Sadly, regardless of what happens in Egypt in the next few days, a long road lies ahead in the struggle for equality.

By Alex Neve, Secretary General Amnesty International Canada 
From all the conversations I had with survivors of human rights abuses and their relatives in the ten days I spent in Mauritania recently, one question has stayed in my mind. 
A woman, whose children cannot access public schools or health care because their father is imprisoned in an unknown location, for reasons of ‘public security’, asked: “this is their view of security?” 
	Her husband and 13 other men have been held in a secret location since May 2011, having been convicted of charges related to terrorism. 
For more than two years they have had no contact with their families nor access to lawyers. Authorities say the men are still alive but they won’t say where they are being held and will not allow visits. 
The men’s children can only be registered for public schools and health care if their fathers have been properly inscribed in the new census (impossible if you are “disappeared”); or if a death certificate is available (impossible if you are still alive). 
This impossible situation seems to be routine in Mauritania, particularly when it comes to trying to justify the fight against terrorism. 
 
Security and anti-terrorism are pervasive themes in Mauritania these days. The country has watched events unfolding in other countries in the region with considerable worry, such as the Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb offensive launched last year in neighbouring Mali. 
Internally and externally they are under pressure to stand firm against possible threats. And of course they should. 
But what is an appropriate response? Serious human rights violations are being committed in the name of security which, in the end, serves only to spread injustice and deepen insecurity. 
We spent many days in the Prison Centrale, interviewing some thirty people who have been convicted on terrorism-related charges, and sentenced to punishments ranging from one year’s imprisonment to the death penalty. 
Among the prisoners are a number of foreigners, including from Canada, Mali and Guinea Bissau. 
All provided us with detailed descriptions of the torture they experienced in police custody, before being transferred to the prison. In terrorism-related cases prisoners can be held by the police for up to 45 days without being charged, and without access to legal counsel or family. 
The list of torture methods grew distressingly long as our interviews progressed. Most frequently it involved painful, wrenching ways of incapacitating prisoners by chaining their hands and feet together, in front or behind their backs, or while being suspended from window grilles, doorways and ceiling fixtures; and then beating them repeatedly, often until prisoners lost consciousness. 
And it would only end when the prisoners agreed to sign a statement confessing to any number of things, a statement that was generally not even read to them before they signed it. That statement then would become the basis, often the sole basis, for the subsequent conviction and prison sentence. 
It is impossible to have any confidence in the convictions, as the abuses that all of these prisoners have endured are so serious. Torture-derived statements in which prisoners will confess to almost anything provide no guarantee that police have the right person. And this is their view of security? 
Mauritanians also continue to suffer the injustice and insecurity of the most iconic global example of human rights sold short in the name of security: Guantánamo Bay.  Two Mauritanians, Mohamedou Ould Slahi and Ahmed Ould Abdel Aziz remain held there.  President Obama’s 2009 and 2013 promises to close the notorious detention camp have not yet made any difference to either of them. 
We met with relatives of both men. It was so impressive to hear of and see photos and videos of the campaigning they have done to draw attention to these two men’s plights. I was particularly struck to see television clips of demonstrations with the orange jumpsuits and black hoods that have been front and centre in so many Amnesty protests around the world over the years, used to good effect here as well. 
Both families were particularly eager to hear me describe the three trips I took to Guantánamo Bay in 2010, even though I had of course come nowhere hear the detention camps in which the two men are held and had not caught even a glimpse of either of them. It seemed to give them something to hold onto; speaking with someone who has been in the place where their loved ones are held. 
The families of Slahi and Abdel Aziz want their government to be their champion. We met with the Minister of Justice, who did confirm that Mauritania is ready to take them back. But what is needed is something more assertive. Mauritania must ask for them back. 
The right way to reply to that haunting query, “that is their view of security?”, would be by seeking that return from Guantánamo; by acting to stop torture; and by ending secret detention and unfair trials.  Because the best path to security comes through protecting human rights.

People are out and loud and proud and celebrating. But in many parts of the world, simply the perception that a person is LGBTI can lead to insecurity, lengthy prison sentences, or worse. This week Amnesty International released a report on rising...","Here are the stories of some of the brave LGBTI activists in sub-Saharan who at great personal risk agreed to be interviewed by Amnesty International for this report: 
 
Your browser does not have the necessary plugin to display this content. 
  
Many of his compatriots would not hesitate to say Dismus Aine Kevin is a criminal, even though he has never actually committed a crime. 
But what the Ugandan authorities object to about this 30-year-old activist is that he is gay – and in Uganda, it is illegal to love someone of the same sex. 
His sexual identity appears so dangerous to the authorities that, last October, the Ugandan police searched the office of his organization, The Rainbow Health Foundation. 
They wanted to know what the group was doing and an investigation followed. 
Not long ago, Dismus was even kicked out of his rented house after a neighbour told his landlord he was gay. 
“If you are openly gay in school you would be kicked out. There will be no questions. They will make you vacate your housing premises. In the small health centres, if they suspect you are [gay], they will throw you out. You are going to be thrown out or you won’t be [seen to]. Even if you have malaria. Everyone has to hide,” Dismus told Amnesty International. 
Being openly gay in a place like Uganda is incredibly dangerous. 
This year, the sub-Saharan country is set to re-introduce the Anti-Homosexuality Bill that seeks to broaden the penalties for ‘homosexual acts’, which are already illegal there. The most recent version of the bill provides for the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality”. 
It also imposes life sentences for consensual same-sex conduct, and criminalizes the “promotion” of homosexuality – a direct attack on the freedom of expression of human rights defenders. 
“If this bill passes, Uganda will need to build bigger prisons. This bill will mean that my father, my mother and my brother will become criminals and face prison terms of up to seven years simply for not reporting me to the police for being a lesbian,” explains Ugandan activist Jay Abang. 
‘Illegal’ love		Uganda is not alone. 
In fact, homosexuality is against the law in 38 African countries yet an increasing number of nations are pushing legislation which will further criminalize lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people. 
According to Amnesty International, in the last decade sub-Saharan Africa has seen a surge in levels of discrimination and violence towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals. 
The rising tide of homophobia means that LGBTI people face increasing harassment, persecution and denigration across the continent, with activists reporting attacks, arbitrary arrests, evictions and blackmail. 
Dismus has seen firsthand the consequences of discrimination against LGBTI people. 
He has witnessed, for example, people not being able to pursue an education because they were disowned by their families and individuals who were turned away from hospitals and health services because they were gay. 
Jackson Otieno, a 29-year-old bisexual activist from Kenya says the level of discrimination and harassment in his country varies from place to place: 
“In some places people wouldn’t care. You can sit holding hands with your partner in a restaurant. But in informal settlements, you wouldn’t dare do that. We have seen cases of people being evicted from home, people being attacked. We had cases that they threaten people and the police don’t know how to deal with them.” 
“For some lesbian women, just after teenage years, their family force them to marry or they lock them in the house and they bring men to have sex with them. That’s how corrective rape happens in Kenya.” 
Facing stigma in Cameroon		In Cameroon the situation is not any better as same-sex consensual relationships are also banned by law. 
“I went to hospital for a test, and the doctor said I had a STI (sexually transmitted infection) and told me to come back with my partner…. My girlfriend and I came to the hospital…. But when we sat down, the doctor told us to go away. When we left, he called his colleagues and they were pointing at us saying ‘lesbian, lesbian’,” said Jo Mandeng, a lesbian activist from Cameroon. 
Jo said lesbian women in her country face such levels of discrimination and stigma many consider resorting to desperate measures. 
“I know friends, gays and lesbians, who attempted suicide. My friends call me and say ‘ I cannot go on’ and I need to comfort them. The most dangerous is the rejection by the family, when you are cut off from any financial support, you get depressed and suicidal,” she told Amnesty International. 
Mental health issues amongst LGBTI people were such a concern for her that in 2009 she joined “Alternatives Cameroon”, an organization that works for equality, tolerance, and respect for people who suffer from social exclusion. 
According to Joseph Achilles Tiedjou from ADEFHO (Association of Defence of Homosexuals), the situation for gay men in Cameroon is just as bad, with many being targeted with arrests and violence ordered or condoned by the authorities. 
He says the backlash against gay men means that many find it hard to find a job and the law puts them at constant risk of arbitrary arrest, denunciation, extortion and blackmail. 
“We have hundreds of cases of people who have been kicked out of hospital because their medical condition was to do with their sexual orientation. Breach of confidentiality, where the doctor says to their assistant, ‘why did you admit this person, he is gay and I don’t want them here.’ Or if you have a problem with your neighbour, your neighbour can threaten to go to the police and say you are gay. Gay people practise a lot of self censorship,” Joseph says. 
Fighting back		Despite the increasing levels of discrimination and abuse against LGBTI people across Africa, many courageous individuals are fighting back. 
Dismus, for example, runs an organization that provides support to LGBTI people in rural areas of western Uganda, where discrimination is particularly high. 
His organization, the Rainbow Health Foundation, shares information on sexually transmitted diseases, identifies friendly health workers, provides small start-up loans and delivers human rights training to security personnel. 
It was set up in 2010 with seven people and now has more than 300 members. 
“We don’t talk about ourselves in the media. We work with a referral system [word of mouth]. I know you, you know your friend. That is how we work within our community.  We call ourselves rural LGBTI activists. Our major focus is to give services to people who live where services don’t easily reach them,” said Dismus. 
“LGBTI people are humans. They don’t come from another planet. They are not asking for special [treatment]. …they are people who live with you, these are your brothers and sisters, all they need is to be safe where they live.”

	It was on a Friday when we gathered in my daughter Fatima’s flat as a family – eating together, talking about politics and human rights or joking and laughing. 
Suddenly we heard a very loud noise. In a matter of seconds the flat door was broken in and burly, masked men burst into the room. I cannot explain how I felt at that moment, because no word in the dictionary, or in any language, can explain it. 
My husband had always said “whenever they come to take me, please do not interfere and I will just go with them”. But he was not allowed to go peacefully. One of them grabbed him by the neck and then pulled him down the stairs by his legs. He was brutally beaten – punched and kicked in front of me and my daughters. When my eldest daughter interfered, they responded with insults and tried to arrest her too. I was torn between begging them not to take her and looking at my husband on the stairs where they were still kicking him and praying that he was ok. As if that was not enough, I suddenly noticed three masked men holding my three sons-in-law by their necks and taking them downstairs. At that point I was furious, sad and helpless. 
My husband was gone, but I could not show how sad I felt because my daughters were suffering after watching the arrest of their husbands and father. 
From that night on, our lifestyle changed. We would stay up all night, just in case the masked men decided to come back, and sleep after sunrise. We always slept fully clothed, just in case. Every sound made me jump and check the apartment was safe. 
Days went by and we were waiting for news – any news. We asked a lawyer to try to get any information about their condition or whereabouts. He told us that that would be fruitless since lawyers weren’t being told anything about detainees. I was praying to God, “Please just keep them alive!” – because after seeing how ‘Abdulhadi was beaten, I was not sure that he had survived. My daughter decided to go on hunger strike. She was getting weaker and weaker every day. 
 
	Weeks after the arrest, my husband called. He could barely speak and the call lasted seconds. He said that the oppression was great but his spirits were still high. All I could think at that point was: “At least now I know he is alive!” I only learned about the extent of my husband’s injuries and his subsequent operation by watching the news. That day I wished I was dead. 
I was very scared and worried about what I would see when I met him again. Then the trial started and I saw him. His face was different but his soul was unchanged. His head was held high, his eyes were sharp, and he was proud as ever. I was so happy to see his soul. Yes, as strange as that sounds, I can see my husband’s soul. 
I have lived with ‘Abdulhadi for 30 years; 30 great years. He is my husband, my best friend, my soul-mate and my everything. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment and I hope that the pressure will be so great on the government that they will be forced to set him free. Until then, I am lucky to have so many good memories with this kind, wise, respectful, truthful and lovely husband of mine. I can go on forever re-living those memories while waiting for him. 
I find myself amused by the fact that, although I am 52 years old, I usually can’t sleep on the nights of our visits. I usually spend the whole night thinking of what I will tell him the following day. During these visits he helps me look on the bright side of life. We talk about all our happy memories together and usually end up laughing about some joke or another. 
I love my husband and I am so proud of him, both as a man and a human rights defender.

				Khadija visited Abdulhadi in January, and noted that he was in good spirits and that he has a gift of adapting to different situations. 
Abdulhadi still suffers from numbness to the face, following from his torture. He was told by the doctor that he had 18 plates in the face and 36 screws – therefore he cannot open his mouth properly, making it difficult when brushing his teeth.

,  
In November 2013, the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) is set to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  Commonwealth countries share a commitment to basic values such as democracy, freedom, respect of human rights, and rule of law. 
,  
Today, June 26, is recognized in and also beyond the Commonwealth as the international day for survivors of torture.  Yet in Sri Lanka, survivors of torture are still vulnerable to human rights violations, and to traumatic feelings of sheer injustice because authorities who committed torture have not even being charged with committing a crime or a human rights violation. 
,  
Thevan (not his real name) is one person who has flashbacks of the impossible days he spent being tortured in a police cell in Sri Lanka’s capital, Colombo.  Thevan and a friend were both abducted 5 years ago in November, 2008, by men who drove a white van, and taken to a detention centre where they were beaten and tortured for three days.  Far worse, Thevan was ill-treated continually until he was finally released in 2011. 
,  
The conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which was an armed opposition group that fought for an independent Tamil state on the island, lasted for 26 years until May 2009.  Yet despite the passage of four years since it ended, the Sri Lankan Government continues to deny the increasing evidence of crimes under international law committed by its armed forces during the conflict. 
,  
Dramatically, even though the Commonwealth of Nations agreed that its leaders will meet in Sri Lanka later this year, Sri Lanka still is a country where human rights violations take place, contrary to the values agreed by the 54 member nations of the Commonwealth. 
,  
Canada and Sri Lanka have a special relationship because Canada has one of the world’s largest Tamil diasporas from Sri Lanka.  However, Amnesty’s stress on human rights is answered merely by the Sri Lanka High Commission’s claim that “separatist elements within the diaspora … still continue to relentlessly disseminate anti-Sri Lanka propaganda.” (High Commission newsletter, April 2013) 
,  
Canada`s prime minister Stephen Harper has made very clear that impartial, international researchers, including from the U.N., have verified that human rights violations still occur in Sri Lanka.  Mr. Harper has also made clear that he will not attend the CHOGM this year unless the Sri Lankan Government improves respect for human rights, and also initiates serious efforts at reconciliation between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority on the island. 
,  
Amnesty International is calling on the government of Sri Lanka to “Tell the Truth” on arbitrary detention and torture, and to institute clear and basic reforms to guarantee respect for human rights, before the Heads of Commonwealth Government’s Meeting (CHOGM) in November.  
,  
We are asking all Canadians committed to human rights to sign a petition urging the Sri Lanka government to improve respect for human rights in basic ways. Sri Lanka should not continue to host the leaders of Commonwealth countries while abusing the values of those same 54 member countries.

Alex Neve,		Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada		Nouakchott, Mauritania		June 24, 2013 
  
–  Canadian national Aaron Yoon, 24 years of age, interviewed in the Prison Civil, Nouakchott, Mauritania, June 2013. 
Over the past ten days, as part of an Amnesty International mission in Mauritania I have spent many days interviewing prisoners in three prisons in the capital, Nouakchott.  For years now, Amnesty International has documented serious and widespread torture in Mauritania and the research mission followed up on those and other human rights concerns.   
Among many prisoners I interviewed in Nouakchott’s Prison Centrale, I heard much about torture from a young Canadian man, Aaron Yoon, who has been held here for the past 18 months.  Aaron’s tale is a complicated and unusual one; which he realizes.  He knows that many Canadians will have questions about the chain of events that brought him to this point.  But he wants all to realize that he has been tortured and has been convicted on the basis of a blatantly unfair trial that gave him no opportunity to defend himself.  As he said to me: “I hope people will not rush to judge me unless they give me a fair chance to respond to what is being said about me.  It is terrible to be tortured.  It makes you say what they want you to say.” 
	  
The concerns about torture in Mauritania are widespread and longstanding, including in the cases of a growing number of prisoners held on charges related to terrorism or national security, but also with respect to minors, women and men detained on ordinary criminal charges.  In fact, virtually no one is safe from torture when in the hands of the Mauritanian police. 
 
An Amnesty International delegation was last in the Prison Centrale in June and July 2012.  At that time a colleague of mine came across Aaron.  Aaron was worried that his family in Canada would be deeply distressed if they learned he was in prison.  He told Amnesty International that he had come to Mauritania to study Arabic and the Koran and he knew that they would have peace of mind thinking that was still what he was doing.  He therefore asked that Amnesty not take up his case; a request that we of course honoured. 
All of that changed dramatically earlier this year.  Media reports, beginning with the CBC, revealed that two high school friends of Aaron’s, Ali Medlej and Xristos Katsiroubas, had been part of an armed group that mounted a terrorist attack at a gas plant in Algeria in January 2013; and that both had been killed when the plant was retaken.  Reporters soon uncovered that Aaron was in prison in Mauritania and sought to make connections between him and his two friends.  For several days in April the story, including the fact that Aaron had requested that Amnesty not work on his case, dominated Canadian news. 
Our Amnesty delegation spoke with Aaron several times over the course of four separate visits to the Prison Centrale.  He recounted the various twists and turns that had ended in a Mauritanian jail cell, beginning with Aaron, Ali and Chris’s leaving Canada in May 2011 to study Arabic and the Koran.  They travelled first to Morocco and then continued on to Mauritania soon after.  They studied first at a school in the capital; but then moved to a school in the small village of Naîm, some 100 kilometres outside Nouakchott.  
 
Amnesty International delegation meets with Cheikh Yacoub, the director of the Islamic school or mahedra in Naîm where Aaron Yoon was studying at the time of his arrest. 
We later had an opportunity to spend some time in Naîm and met with the director of that school or mahedra.  He remembered Aaron and the 2 other Canadians and described them as being students like all others, pursuing a serious course of religious study.  He told us he had been surprised and saddened to hear of what had happened to them. 
According to Aaron, Ali and Chris didn’t stick it out in Naîm; leaving separately for Morocco and Lebanon soon after.  Aaron continued with his studies. 
He was arrested in mid-December 2011, while he was back in the capital carrying out some errands.  He was held first in police custody, before being transferred to prison.  As is the case with so many prisoners, it was while he was in the hands of the police that he was tortured. 
When they first began to question him he asked for a lawyer and a translator; and refused to answer any questions.  He told me: “I couldn’t answer many of their questions without a translator anyway as my Arabic was still pretty basic at that time.  Simply asserting those rights is what unleashed the torture.  They were furious with me.” 
He was beaten repeatedly for what he said seemed an eternity; off and on for close to one hour.  He was kicked, punched and hit with sticks of wood.  Eventually he lost consciousness.  When he awoke he was alone, in the same room; a small cell in total darkness with no windows. 
His tormentors soon returned.  This time they tied his hands and feet behind his back, in an agonizing position that made him feel like his joints were going to pop.  He was laid on the floor, stomach first, and the beating began again.  It was not as long as the first session but the psychological effect was much stronger.  He realized that this would never end unless he told them what they wanted.  So he agreed to sign a statement which confirmed that he had been planning to go to Mali to join al-Qaeda.  The statement itself, written in Arabic, was never read or translated to him.  Prisoners being forced to sign statements without knowing the contents, after being tortured, is a pattern that Amnesty International has documented among the majority of prison interviews we have carried out over the past five years.   
Even now the beatings still haunt him.  He has particular memories of the crushing pain of the ring on the hand of the police officer who meted out the most vicious of the punches and slaps. 
He was left in police custody for three weeks.  There were no further beatings but while held his feet and ankles were cuffed and linked by a chain.  The statement he signed has followed him everywhere since.  Every official and every judge who has reviewed his case has relied on it.  
He has had brief court appearances, for his trial and his appeal.  Each time there have been no witnesses; and no evidence other than his statement (tainted by torture).  He has had a court-appointed lawyer present on one occasion, but Aaron says the lawyer did not actively intervene in the proceedings to defend him.  
When I met Aaron he was awaiting the outcome of an appeal in his case.  Officials have asked that his two year sentence, which would expire in December of this year, be increased to a ten year sentence.   The appeal decision was supposed to be rendered on June 9th but was delayed and has not yet been rescheduled.  Much hangs in the balance.  If the appeal is rejected he should be released from prison this December.  If his sentence is increased that obviously will not be the case.   
Aaron has had many visits from Canadian officials at the consulate in Mauritania and also from the embassy in Morocco.  He appreciates the visits but says that he is not aware of what action has been taken by officials to ensure that his rights are being protected. 
Aaron’s detailed description of the torture he experienced in police custody is consistent with many other testimonies gathered by Amnesty International  over the past two decades, including during this mission.  The names he provided of those responsible for his torture, and his vivid physical description of the officer who took the lead in the beatings, is in keeping with numerous other accounts.  So too is his recounting of the blatantly unfair nature of the trial proceedings. 
I made it clear to Aaron that Amnesty International is in no position to judge the allegations against him, whatever they may be. We aren’t a police or security agency; that is not our role.  I stressed that our focus lay with his allegations of torture and an unfair trial. His parting words to me were along those very lines.  “I am innocent and hope I can prove that one day.  Whatever people may think about me because of what my friends have done; whatever people may think of me because they don’t understand the choices I have made – I hope they do understand one thing.  No one should ever be tortured and I have been tortured.”

	On June 17 health professionals across Canada held rallies demanding the government reverse changes to health care for refugees which were made one year ago. The changes have put the lives of some refugees and asylum seekers at risk in Canada.  Doctors have reported cases of children who can’t get medication for asthma; pregnant women denied medications while in labour; and fathers who can’t get medication for high blood pressure and diabetes.  As a result of the cuts to health care many refugees end up being treated in emergency rooms after being turned away from walk-in clinics. 
 
Denying access to health care for refugees is one of many measures the Canadian government has taken to prevent or discourage people in search of safety from making refugee claims in Canada. In the past year Canada has passed new laws which treat refugees differently according to what country they come from and how they arrive in Canada.  The net result is less protection for people seeking safety and laws which contravene our international obligations. 
European Union countries engage in border management practices that put migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees at risk. In March Greek authorities found the bodies of six Syrian nationals including a 17-year-old pregnant woman and a mother with her young children in the waters between Turkey and Greece.  As border controls become tighter, people take more and more dangerous routes in search of safety. Many others have forced people back to countries where the risk of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detention, is well known. Many of those who manage to enter Europe end up being detained for long periods of time.  Some countries have introduced criminal penalties for those who arrive in an irregular manner and punish people who help irregular migrants. 
 In Mexico men, women and children take one of the most dangerous journeys in the world. They travel on the top of trains across Mexico with the hope of reaching the US border. Each year thousands of migrants are abducted, beaten, raped, tortured and forced to work for criminal gangs which prey on the migrants.  Public officials often collude with these criminal gangs. Most abuses are not investigated adequately and those responsible are rarely held to account.  People working at shelters for migrants have faced threats and attacks for their humanitarian work.  
 Syria’s brutal conflict has forced millions of men, women and children to seek shelter in other parts of the country and abroad.  More than 1.5 million have become refugees, mostly in the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Some are in refugee camps, while others are staying with friends and relatives or in rented accommodation. UN humanitarian agencies have repeatedly expressed concern about the challenge they are facing to raise the necessary funds to look after the growing number of Syrian refugees. The conflict in Syria is being fought with utter disregard for the rules of international humanitarian law and thereby causing so much death, suffering and destruction.  
  Canada’s health care professionals demonstrated that they believe in a country of compassion and justice. They recognize that refugees fleeing rape, torture, exile and trauma need laws that protect and systems that support. World Refugee Day is an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of refugees to our country.  It should also be a day which celebrates the world’s commitment to protect refugees at home and abroad.	  
Some refugees who have come to Canada in search of safety are now being denied basic, emergency, and life-saving medical care. Changes to healthcare introduced in Canada last year means that some refugees cannot see a doctor. And some are denied treatment because it is not clear if they are eligible for care.

The goal of the HRC was to empower and support young activists and to facilitate their active leadership within Amnesty International. We spent the three days building our human rights knowledge, developing skills as activists, preparing for the AGM. Sharing an experience with other individuals who are also committed to standing up against injustice was inspiring. 
 
The college started with the participants sitting in on an Amnesty 101 session. The session provided a great background on Amnesty International and an in-depth introduction to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Participants also had the opportunity to share “what human rights means” throughout the discussion. This session really built the foundation for the rest of the upcoming sessions and activities. 
Amnesty staff led sessions on their areas of focus for the college; Jacqueline Hansen, who does amazing work on women’s rights campaigning, shared with the group the rights that women are entitled to, like sexual and reproductive rights, and the right to decide whether and when to have children. The session also highlighted the “My Body, My rights” campaign, a campaign that focuses on pressuring governments not to backtrack and take away our rights to make choices about our bodies and our lives. 
 
We also had an advocate for art session run by Hilary Holmes, a major campaigner. Participants deconstructed various street art that had a human rights focus and discussed what really is effective protest art. Maria Aman, a participant shared that “the really great thing about art is that it is universal, it’s like a common language between all ages and it’s a great way to get people thinking”. By the end of the session, everyone split into groups to create their own protest art and had to deconstruct each other’s work. Groups picked issues like child soldiers, freedom of expression and gender equality. “It’s really great to have both a knowledge based and skills based sessions, giving us the best of both” participant Monica Petek said. 
The college also included some fun activities. We had a human-rights-speed-dating challenge, where we split into groups and had country and campaign coordinators from Amnesty come talk to us. It was really great to get a one-on-one chance to have them share their own stories with us. Johsa Manzanilla, the Philippines country coordinator told about how she gained insight into her culture and identity through her role. Aubrey Harris, the death penalty coordinator, gave us different perspectives on the issue. Jonah Kanter, the newly appointed Syria coordinator, told the story of how his love of music directed him to Amnesty. It was interesting to hear stories from all the diverse backgrounds, both professionally and personally, that members bring to Amnesty. 
Another activity that everyone loved was called” Meet the Big Wigs”. We were joined by Sarah Beamish, Amnesty International Canada’s President, Bob Goodfellow, the Executive Director, and Alex Neve, the Secretary General. We talked together about the challenges they faced, their journey through Amnesty and the best advice they ever got and would pass on to us. Something that stuck with most people was Alex Neve mentioning the best piece of advice he got, “in whatever you’re doing, never forget the human part”. 
One moment that’s surely stood out for everyone was having human rights defender Nasser El Ras share is powerful story. Nasser is a young Canadian who was detained in Bahrain in March 2011 during a visit to see his family. Over the following year, he spent two periods in jail, was tortured and was sentenced in October 2011 to five years in prison for participating in peaceful protests. Amnesty got wind of this and supported Nasser throughout his suffering. Finally, in February 2012, it was announced that Nasser was free and he returned to Canada. Nasser told us about the abuse he went through, shared openly his emotions, and of his feeling of hope for the future. There was not a person in the room unmoved by his words and courage. He continues to strive for justice in Bahrain. It’s incredible individuals like Nasser that reminded us why we need to keep on fighting for human rights! 
We ended the human rights college with what we call the “warm fuzzy moment thing”. All of participants and leaders came together to reflect on their 2013 HRC experience. Everyone joined in a circle and shared what was their favourite moment, what is their commitment to Amnesty, and something they really liked about another individual. This was done all while passing along string, keeping us all connected. A couple of tears and laughs later, we all cut the one long piece of string and made bracelets to remind us of our special time at the HRC. Finally, off we went to the AGM! 
 
It was absolutely great being a part of the HRC this year. Meeting the HRC participants was inspiring and special. They all showed a great passion and commitment for human rights activism and I can’t wait to see what great things they do in the future! The HRC is good reminder that young people have the power to make a big difference in our world.

This week Canada had the rather unenviable position of chairing negotiations at the UN Human Rights Council on its annual resolution on violence against women. It is something Canada has done for close to twenty years, and Canada’s leadership has been lauded for progressively strengthening this important resolution. 
,  
This should be easy, right? Who wouldn’t want to support actions to combat violence, and in particular sexual violence, against women and girls? Think again. It certainly wasn’t the case this year. 
,  
A handful of countries don’t support strong action to combat violence against women. Egypt, Russia, China, Cuba, the Holy See, and others, all worked behind the scenes to weaken protections to women and girls who are victimized by sexual violence. 
,  
And where was Canada? Canada was dealing with feedback from countries that wanted strong language to protect women, and an assault from countries that wanted to weaken the draft resolution text. This is why I say that Canada was in an unenviable position this week—trying to strike a balance between so many different interests is never easy. 
,  
But the overriding goal shouldn’t necessarily be to strike a balance. We should be looking at how best to protect women and girls from all forms of violence, and we should be looking at how best to ensure that all women have their fundamental human rights, including the rights to health, equality and life, fully respected. 
,  
The final text adopted today does strike a balance. Among other things it includes very good language condemning marital rape and early and enforced marriage. But does it best protect women and ensure their rights will be fully respected? It needed to go further. It fails to include provisions for sexuality education for adolescents, which play a role in promoting gender equality, female empowerment, and reduction of gender-based violence. The resolution does mention the need to provide sexual and reproductive health services to violence survivors, but it fails to list what services must be available, including emergency contraception, safe abortion, post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. The provision of these critical services for survivors of sexual violence is contentious and nonexistent in many countries. That is why referencing these examples explicitly would have added tremendously to the resolution.  
,  
These are contentious issues that are not easy for any state to deal with, but they are not impossible to tackle. This week the United States found the right path and came out strongly in support of including language on sexuality education and services for violence survivors. 
,  
What could  a country chairing this sort of negotiations do differently? It would not have been risky to insert pre-agreed language from the 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. This would have avoided re-opening the battles waged on this text before its adoption in March. 
,  
Compromising on international standards lowers the bar. In this case the bar was lowered because the strong language adopted at the Commission on the Status of Women was excluded. This dealt a victory to the group of states working to erode women’s sexual and reproductive rights, who did not want text on sexuality education and services for sexual violence survivors referenced in the UN Human Rights Council. 
,  
The UN Security Council will pass a resolution in July on sexual violence. The Conference on Population and Development will review its language on sexual and reproductive rights in 2014. At all of these forums, we must advocate for bold leadership that will put the rights of women and girls at the forefront, because we can’t compromise on our rights to make decisions about our bodies and our lives.

I was expecting to have a great vacation in Turkey. I wasn’t expecting to watch history unfold. Fortunately, however, I happened to be in Istanbul between May 26 and June 5. I had rented a room near Taksim Square, and I was in the square or the adjacent Gezi Park for almost 24 hours a day (it’s impossible to stay home when the world seems to be ending…). 
 
For me, the beginning of the protests was the most difficult time, because we all felt forgotten. When I returned to the apartment in the middle of the night on Friday May 31, I anticipated frantic emails and phone messages from my family and friends. But no one had been in touch. This was not surprising, since unless you were directly connected with Turkish protesters on Facebook or Twitter, it was impossible to know what was happening. But the feeling of isolation was nonetheless dreadful. It was such a relief when bloggers and the international media started taking notice. Amnesty – the national office in Turkey and the international secretariat – was one of the first organizations to draw attention to the situation. Simply knowing that people were paying attention – especially people overseas, completely unconnected from the action – was incredibly empowering, much more than I could have imagined. 
 
 
Overall, my experience was both terrifying and marvelous. Frightening, because the government’s response to these peaceful demonstrations has been vicious and relentless. Although the police had been expelled from Taksim within a couple days, and people had erected barricades to keep them out, the security forces were never very far away. Busloads of them waited, armed, at the end of every entrance to the square, and tear gas and pepper spray were constantly in the air. Helicopters circled ominously. I couldn’t leave the apartment without a mask and goggles – if I’d stayed longer I would have bought a helmet, as many people did. My friends wrote their blood-type on their arms – afraid of what might happen to them, yet refusing to be intimidated. I saw lawyers and doctors marching in uniform in the streets, jeopardizing much more than their careers. I saw people with bloodied faces calling for medical help, people with bandages and casts from their encounters with the police, people with eyes reddened and streaming from the tear gas, people running in fear. 
But my experience was also wonderful, because of the creative energy and hope that have been released. In an Istanbul where Kurds perform halay ceremonies in Taksim Square, next to gay rights activists draping a rainbow flag over a statue of the founder of modern Turkey, nothing seems astonishing anymore. My friends expressed their enormous sense of relief:  “Finally, it’s happened!” “We’ve been afraid too long; no more running away.” People were relieved, defiant, and exuberant. The atmosphere of possibility in Gezi Park was contagious. People handed out free food and water, built a library, set up a yoga space. As one friend told me, “If the quiet, stay-at-home yogis are protesting, you know it’s big!” A vet provided free care for the street animals who were injured by the water cannons and tear gas, and I saw food for dogs and cats laid out around the park, as well as dishes of fresh water. A café on the square allowed protesters to take it over in order to set up a coordination centre for medical and other supplies.  
 
Something that particularly struck me about the protests was the cleanliness. Every night, tens of thousands of people would converge on the park and square – eating, drinking, sleeping, smoking, singing, dancing. Although there was barely room to move, I never saw anyone walk on the flower beds. And every morning, small groups of sleep-deprived protesters – gas masks draped around their necks, brooms and bags in hand – would sweep the park clean. By noon, it was virtually spotless. One day, I saw people washing out a dry fountain with buckets of clean water. There was a stark contrast between this respect for public spaces and local businesses, and the anger towards the police and construction vehicles (which had been smashed and burnt out), as well as many internationally owned banks and businesses (which were often covered in graffiti). 
Another remarkable aspect about the protests was their dark sense of humour. Although I could only understand a very small part of the graffiti that appeared all over the city centre, it was easy to gauge by all the laughter that it much of it was amusing. On a store selling cosmetics:  “Pepper spray is good for the complexion.” On a wine shop:  “Şerefine Tayyip,” a sarcastic “Cheers” to the Prime Minister, referring to his restrictions on the sale of alcohol. There were humorous versions of the Prime Minister’s name; for instance, “Erdoğaz,” and “Recop” (“cop” means baton in Turkish). And of course, many stencils, posters and pictures of penguins; on the night of Friday May 31, instead of reporting on the massive, unprecedented protests and brutal police response, CNN Turkey showed…a penguin documentary. 
One thing I learned over the past week is that screams of panic and cheers of joy are almost indistinguishable. It always required a few moments to determine what was actually going on. I think that likewise, it is impossible to know at this point what is in store for Turkey; whether police terror will triumph, or whether peaceful expression and joyful possibility will carry the day. Despite all the repression, I remain deeply hopeful about the outcome. 
I have just returned to Canada, where I will continue raising awareness about the serious and ongoing human rights violations in Turkey. Turkey wields enormous economic and political power in the Middle East, and it is critical to speak out about these attacks on Turkish people’s fundamental freedoms. 
Canadians are paying attention. Help show Turkey and the world that the protesters are not alone:

They criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Orthodox Church officials who supported him. 
 Why did you choose to protest against Putin in this way? 
“Pussy Riot is political art. If you are an artist you can’t help but react to political tendencies in your country, especially the state’s attitude towards civil society and the wide gap between society and the state elite.” 
 What did all the activism surrounding your trial and sentence mean to you? 
	“We wanted to protest against the Russian Orthodox Church, [and its] Patriarch Kirill; against Putin and sexist tendencies. The support we received took this  already ongoing discussion in Russian society to a new level. We didn’t expect it to become so widely discussed around the world – and so acutely in Russia. 
	Besides, the state authorities don’t just use handcuffs and arrests, but also use media attacks. There’s a constant flow of misinformation, of utter defamation. It’s difficult to convince people that it isn’t all true. 
The campaigns supporting us stood against all that. Many people saw Pussy Riot’s supporters and thought: ‘Strangely, despite them being so bad and blasphemous, many people support them. Maybe things aren’t exactly as they say on Channel One [one of the main Russian TV channels]?’ That struggle was very important and truly necessary. 
	It also influenced many people that international organizations, including Amnesty International, declared us prisoners of conscience, and that celebrities, including Madonna, Sting and others, showed their support.” 
 Do the conditions of your suspended sentence restrict you a lot? 
	“In general, no. But I notice that I’m sometimes under surveillance, quite explicitly. Several times on the subway I’ve seen someone clearly doing a video recording. Other Pussy Riot members are also followed. 
	Apparently the authorities fear that we’re planning another protest, and that’s why they’re keeping an eye on us. But this isn’t professional surveillance. They either lack experience or are simply sending us a message: ‘You are being watched’. 
	My phone is tapped, I’m sure of that. So of course I watch what I say.” 
 Are you afraid to continue to participate in protest activities in Russia? 
 “No. Nobody’s threatened me, nothing has happened. I see signs of a different war, a media war. Someone is seemingly trying to supervise us indirectly, without violence, without killing, without threatening. This is a cold war. Direct approaches won’t work; the whole world would be outraged. They’ve chosen a different strategy, at least for now.” 
 Do you think the threats made against Masha Alekhina by her cellmates are part of the media war, or are they real? 
	“I believe it’s a real threat. I read the interviews with inmates in Masha’s unit. It was because of their threats that Masha filed a complaint and was put into a punishment isolation cell. 
	It is unclear how the penal colony administration will keep Masha safe. It also shows the chaos in the colony, because her cellmates are repeat offenders serving their second or third term. It’s prohibited to keep such prisoners in the same cells and units as those serving their first term. Their psychology has been	completely changed, they have a different understanding of where humanity ends.”	  
What key tendencies can you see now in Russia? 
	“Authoritative power and repressive measures are being strengthened. And laws contradicting the Constitution are being easily and quietly adopted, without much resistance. There are also obvious right-wing tendencies. A particular path has been chosen, close to neo-fascism. 
	The tip of the iceberg is the laws prohibiting ‘propaganda of homosexuality among minors’. It’s a little step along the way of limiting rights. Just like the non-profit organizations law, the high treason law, all of these weird laws. 
	Mass media has shut up, so often you can’t see what is actually happening.” 
 What can the Pussy Riot case teach Russian society? 
“It would be good if it taught people some critical thinking. People aren’t used to seeing protest political art – they don’t understand that it’s a critical gesture. They are shocked by it and, under the influence of official propaganda, think that it is anti-Russian and commissioned by the West. Our state authorities will do anything to make people think that [protest] art is some kind of hooliganism. 
	But many people have realized that something is wrong here. They’ve seen what’s happened, read our interviews, see our work. Many have started taking interest in political feminist art. Next time they see someone doing something publicly or posting media work online, they will recognize it as art and not	hooliganism.” 
 Is it scary to be a protest activist in Russia these days? 
	“It depends on what kind of activist you are. We aren’t so hardcore. In my view, being hardcore is having sensitive information. Then your life will be short. Artistic political activity is not that dangerous. What happened to us probably happened because the Presidential elections were coming up in March last year. 
	But the fact that Nadya and Masha are in jail, that they aren’t being released despite the fact that they have children, is a new means of intimidation. After this, will anyone with kids want to participate in such activities? That is a peculiar kind of cruelty – a propagandist cruelty. It’s important to fight this somehow.”

By Jacqueline Hansen, Major Campaigns and Women’s Rights Campaigner 
Twenty-two-year-old Beatriz from El Salvador waited for 14 weeks to receive life-saving medical treatment, knowing that the fetus growing inside her was missing most of its brain and skull and would not survive, and that her own life was at greater risk each and every day due to medical conditions aggravated by pregnancy. 
Beatriz underwent a cesarean section on Monday, June 3, and her infant died not long after delivery. As of midday on June 4, Beatriz remained in hospital in stable condition. 
Amnesty International members from around the world campaigned in support of Beatriz’s right to make the decision to end her pregnancy to safeguard her health. Concerted action over many weeks drew international media attention and kept pressure on the government of El Salvador. 
Beatriz received treatment that ultimately saved her life and this is good news and a cause for celebration at the end of a long campaign. But was justice served? 
The government of El Salvador did not change its laws. Abortion continues to be prohibited under all circumstances, even if the mother’s life is endangered. The next woman in Beatriz’s situation will be forced to suffer through a frightening pregnancy, hoping she lives to see the birth of her child. If she is lucky she will make contact with an organization who will advocate on her behalf, but even then, receiving medical treatment in a timely manner is unlikely. 
With the eyes of the world on El Salvador, Beatriz waited for 14 weeks, was denied an abortion, and was only able to have labor induced after intervention from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. 
Beatriz’s story is good news—concerted action by Amnesty International members from around the world helped to ensure that at long last, Beatriz received treatment. But we have much work to do around the world and in our own region, where countries including El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Chile ban abortion in all circumstances, denying women access to life-saving treatment, and denying women the freedom to make decisions about their bodies and their lives. 
There are many more women in Beatriz’s situation in the Americas, and we need to continue our work to bring about policy changes to ensure that no other women or girls have to suffer such cruelty, discrimination, and horrendous experiences when trying to access medical treatment.

by Kathy Price, Amnesty International Canada’s campaigner on Latin America 
 
More than two years have passed since I met Yolanda but I have never forgotten her or the harrowing story she told me. 
Yolanda’s son Dan Jeremeel, an insurance agent living in northern Mexico and the father of four young children, disappeared in December 2008.  He left the house according to his normal routine. But he never returned. He was never seen again. 
Like any loving mother, Yolanda did all she could to try to find her son. After discovering that a Mexican soldier had been caught with her son’s car and possessions, Yolanda approached the military, asking for their help to investigate, to find her son and return him to his family – all to no avail. Yolanda got no information, no answers. Instead she received dismissals, snide innuendos and even threats.

Yolanda is not the only mother to live this nightmare. According to a new report released by Amnesty International today, at least 26,000 people were reported missing or disappeared in Mexico over the last six years. It is a staggering number. But authorities in Mexico have systematically failed to take the reports seriously and conduct proper investigations, no matter whether they were abductions committed by criminal gangs acting alone or enforced disappearances in which public officials have colluded or participated. This means the fate and whereabouts of the victims remains unknown and virtually no one has been brought justice, perpetuating a climate where such crimes are tolerated. 
It is a deeply troubling scenario. Many victims, like Yolanda’s son, were on routine journeys when they were stopped by armed men or at security force checkpoints. Some had just left their homes briefly to go to a nearby store or to visit a friend but never returned. Some happened to stumble across criminal activity, sometimes involving public officials. Some were themselves police officers and soldiers. Others were stopped by traffic police for spurious traffic offences and handed over to criminal gangs or other security force agencies. 
But the good news, the hope, in this horrendous story is that ordinary yet extraordinary women like Yolanda and other family members of the disappeared are tirelessly, courageously refusing to accept injustice. In many parts of Mexico, they are joining together to support each other and to press for action. Their efforts have forced the government to take notice and make some important promises, such as creating a special unit to search for the disappeared. 
These are as yet small-scale, isolated measures which are insufficient to address the magnitude of the problem, the scale of involvement of public officials, and the consistent failure to conduct proper investigations. 
Canadians have a special relationship with Mexico. Many of us have travelled there on repeated occasions for wonderful winter escapes. Our government cooperates with the Mexican government via the North American Free Trade Agreement and other programs of collaboration. It is crucial that we use our leverage to call for effective action without delay to end the epidemic of disappearances in Mexico. It is imperative that we raise our voices with Yolanda and support her struggle for truth, justice and an end to the suffering. 
Mexican authorities have a duty to investigate these crimes, but they are failing in this duty, perpetuating a climate of impunity which puts further people at risk of being disappeared. 
You can take action for Human Rights: demand Enrique Peña Nieto, President of Mexico, take effective action without delay to confront the nightmare of disappearances.

Seven weeks ago, few people knew who Beatriz was, but over the last weeks the plight of this 22-year-old woman in El Salvador has inundated social media networks and travelled across the globe. 
Beatriz, a 22-year-old seriously ill pregnant woman who is six months into a non-viable pregnancy and has been diagnosed with a number of severe illnesses including lupus and kidney problems, has so far being prevented from having medical treatment that could save her life. 
After a lengthy court case, on May 29, El Salvador’s Supreme Court of Justice issued a ruling which denied Beatriz her appeal for access to a therapeutic abortion, passing the responsibility for any decision on her treatment to the doctors treating her. This decision left the responsibility for Beatriz’s life and health firmly and solely in the hands of the Salvadoran government as the ultimate guarantors of Beatriz’s human rights. 
Following the Supreme Court ruling, on May 30, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued protective measures for Beatriz, ordering the government to provide her with the treatment she needs without further delay. The Salvadoran government is legally bound to comply with this order. 
The Salvadoran Minister of Health publicly stated on May 30 that Beatriz will be given the treatment she needs, which is is a very welcome commitment.

 Take action now for Hamid 
	  
 
Antonella Mega (centre) and members of Amnesty’s Iran Action Circle in Toronto call for the freedom of Antonella’s husband, Hamid Ghassemi-Shall, a Canadian on death row in Iran.	  
Antonella never expected that a tragedy in her life would bring her to the doorstep of Amnesty International. 
	In the first year following her husband Hamid Ghassemi-Shall’s arrest, detention and trial in Iran she believed that justice would prevail for a man she knew to be innocent of all charges. She maintained this belief until Hamid was sentenced to death. But at that point she knew that she must reach out to anyone who would listen, and be a voice for Hamid in her efforts to bring him home to Canada safely. 
	Hamid’s nightmare began in May 2008 when he left his home in Toronto and flew to Tehran to visit his elderly, sick mother. Soon after arriving in Iran, he was arrested. His detention followed that of his older brother, Alborz. Both brothers were held in solitary confinement in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison for the next 18 months. 
The brothers were sentenced to death in December 2008 following an unfair trial. 
	The conviction appears to have been based on an alleged email exchange that the Iranian authorities said was proof the brothers were involved in espionage and cooperating with a banned opposition group. Hamid maintains that he never sent any such email message. Evidence obtained by his lawyer reportedly confirms that to be the case. 
Hamid has told Antonella that while in Evin Prison, and before he had a lawyer, he was under extreme pressure to confess. Confessions made under torture are often accepted as evidence in Iranian courts. In January 2010, the Iranian authorities reported that Alborz died in prison from stomach cancer. Antonella later received information from a post mortem that there was also evidence of head trauma. 
  
Antonella Mega speaking at the Cities for Life anti-death-penalty event in Toronto on November 30, 2012. 
Antonella first contacted Amnesty International in December 2009. Amnesty then began a process of verifying the details of Hamid’s case and agreeing on a strategy that could help him and not put him further at risk. In May 2010, Antonella made the very difficult decision to make Hamid’s case public. She gave numerous interviews and Hamid’s story began to get national and international coverage. In October 2010, Antonella travelled to New York and stood in front of the UN General Assembly pleading for Hamid’s safety and sharing his story with anyone who would listen.	  
In January 2011, Canada publicly expressed concern for Hamid and encouraged the Iranian authorities to show mercy and compassion. Antonella’s efforts have yielded many positive results. In May 2012, the Canadian House of Commons endorsed an urgent appeal to the Government of Iran to grant clemency to Hamid. Amnesty members across Canada have participated in actions calling on the government of Canada not to give up on Hamid, and calling on the Iranian authorities to spare him from execution. 
 More than 15,000 supporters have signed a petition to stop the execution of Hamid. Thousands of letters and postcards have been sent to the Iranian authorities. Antonella has received thousands of solidarity messages, and hundreds of these have been sent to Hamid in Evin prison. 
	In September 2012, Canada ended diplomatic relations with Iran, but the pleas to Canada for continued diplomatic interventions in Hamid’s case have not stopped. Antonella is asking the public to continue to petition Canadian government officials to intervene through all channels available to save Hamid and bring him home.	  
Hamid remains alive today, almost certainly because of the international attention his case has received. He is not home yet, and the death penalty still looms. Antonella has not given up in her efforts to save Hamid, and neither has Amnesty International.

 Get organized for Pride Season – Check Out Amnesty’s Pride Activist Resource Kit 
 Pride season has arrived for most of Canada and Pride events have begun to take place in communities such as BC’s Fraser Valley. One of the world’s largest Pride events begins in Toronto in just a few short weeks. As we begin our events of celebration, gratitude, and activism, we can take a few moments to reflect on the state of human rights for LGBT individuals globally. That we can even have Pride events has been the result of decades of extraordinary efforts by hardworking and committed activists. These individuals faced ignorance, hatred, violence, and legally-condoned condemnation, to stand up for their rights and for the rights of others. 
It was just a few short decades ago that individuals in North America were legally prohibited from expressing their individuality or gender identity. A couple who shared both love and gender faced stiff fines and jail terms. It was a painful and dangerous time for our trans-identifying and homosexual brothers and sisters. Then, following a raid on on the Stonewall Inn (a gay bar in New York City), the community decided to fight back. They demanded their rights in several protests, and communities across the United States and Canada followed suit.	  
Today, in Canada, we have equal protection under the law, the ability to marry our loved ones, more balanced media exposure, and the creation of gay-straight alliances in several schools across the country. This has fostered a sense of inclusion within the community and helped combat negative attitudes and actions. 
The fight, both at home and abroad, is far from over. Homophobic attacks are still far too commonplace, even in our most urban cities. Children are still teased relentlessly and the suicide rate of LGBT youth is three to four times greater than their hetero and gender normative peers.  Transgendered people face challenges in many avenues, from gaining employment to using a public washroom. It may be challenging to notice homophobic and transphobic attitudes while marching in a supportive parade, but they exist and impact the lives of those on the receiving end of these attitudes. Today the country is less fearful and ignorant of LGBT people but work is needed to ensure that social attitudes reflect the reality that all people deserve to live their lives with dignity and grace. 
From the legal acceptance of marriage equality to the strengthening of current anti-discrimination laws to be LGBT inclusive, there are many causes to champion and celebrate during Pride.  However, there are also waves of distressing news and developments.  From the challenges faced by LGBT activists struggling with a burgeoning Pride movement in the Ukraine to the recent arrest and imprisonment of two men perceived to be homosexual in Zambia, Amnesty International still receives a distressing number of urgent cases from all around the world regarding LGBT people.  The murder and suicide rate of transgendered individuals around the world is nothing short of alarming.	  
The fight for dignity and equality, and the social progress resulting from it, are the heart and soul of the Pride movement. It is a time to celebrate with friends, feel proud and included for who you are and how you express yourself, and meet new and interesting people and ideas. Despite its aim for everyone to have fun and enjoy a carefree experience of love and inclusion, Pride has its roots in a political movement and is ultimately focused on its goal of equal rights for all people.  In Canada and around the world, Pride acts as a catalyst for encouraging dialogue.  Simply put, there is no Pride without the foundations of political activism, domestically and abroad. 
We hope that you all enjoy your local Pride celebrations. Take time to celebrate. Enjoy yourself, have fun, meet new people. Most of all, be visible. Be outrageous or mild. Be outgoing or enjoy a quiet weekend. Be proud of who you are, not in spite of those who would judge you, but independent of them.  However you choose to celebrate Pride, we hope it is a great and safe time for everyone. 
Happy Pride Everyone!!!!! Be yourself. Be proud.

Please join us in taking action on this crisis facing 400 families in Kenya. Amnesty is asking activists around the world to mobilize on behalf of residents of City Carton who were forcibly evicted on May 10, 2013 from an informal settlement in the capital, Nairobi. 
On May 17 their homes were completely demolished. They are homeless and in urgent need of food, water and adequate accommodation. Police, who were providing security for the eviction, used live ammunition and teargas. Further evictions are expected in the neighbouring settlement, Opendo. 
Nearly 400 homes were destroyed in a forced eviction carried out at City Carton in Nairobi West.The settlement, established in 1966, is one of the smaller informal settlements in Nairobi. 
The settlement was cordoned off by 170 police officers between 4 and 5 am on May 10 
Residents were woken by groups of young men who burst into their homes and forced them out before demolishing the informal settlement using crowbars and sledgehammers. 
Senior police officers told Amnesty International the demolitions had been carried out by young men hired by the owners of the City Carton land. The police officers also said they had provided security for the eviction on the orders of the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. 
City Carton residents had been given no opportunity to engage in any consultation with the authorities. Rumours of a possible eviction had spread in the settlement but no notice was given to them. They were therefore unprepared. 
Most of those forcibly evicted were now homeless, and told Amnesty International that they feared the police and young men would return to flatten the settlement entirely and fence off the area. 
TAKE ACTION ON BEHALF OF CITY CARTON RESIDENTS! 
1. Add your name to the international online action lead by Amnesty Ireland: Send an appeal to the Nairobi county governor, Dr Evans Kidero 
2. Governor Kidero Evans is active on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/EvansKidero. Write a message on his “wall” reminding him that forced evictions are illegal under international human rights law! You can should call on him to:  
• Stop any further attempt to demolish either settlement.• Ensure that all those forcibly evicted have immediate access to food, water, healthcare services, and shelter.• Ensure that all those forcibly evicted are provided with effective remedies, including adequate alternative housing and compensation for any losses.• Put all necessary safeguards in place to prevent further forced evictions. 
3. Tweet the Governor and raise awareness on Twitter. Here are some sample tweets: 
.@kideroevans No more #forced evictions in Nairobi! Compensate those who have lost their homes! #AmnestyNow

Less than a month ago, few people knew who Beatriz was. 
But over the last few days and weeks the horrific plight of this 22-year-old woman in El Salvador has inundated social media networks and travelled across the globe. 
		Mother-of-one Beatriz is pregnant and severely ill. She is currently in hospital with lupus and kidney problems. Her health situation is so severe that doctors say she could die if she continues with the pregnancy. The doctors have also diagnosed the foetus as anencephalic (lacking a large part of its brain and skull), which in almost all cases results in the baby’s death before or within a few hours or days of birth. 
Beatriz’s doctors haven’t provided her with the life-saving abortion she needs and is asking for, because they fear they may be prosecuted under Salvadoran laws which impose prison sentences on anyone who performs or has an abortion. 
Two months ago, the doctors wrote to the authorities asking for explicit protection from prosecution if they provide Beatriz with the treatment she critically requires. Despite the obvious urgency of the case, no officials had responded. 
In desperation, Beatriz’s lawyers took her case all the way up to the country’s Supreme Court, asking them to uphold her rights to life and health. 
We thought, with a case this clear and urgent, surely the courts would respond quickly to save this young woman’s life. Yet weeks later, the judges have also failed to treat this case with the urgency it merits. Their delays are unconscionable, as is their failure to issue a ruling that would respect Beatriz’s most basic human rights. 
When Beatriz’s story came to light, I was in El Salvador’s capital, San Salvador. 
Amnesty International immediately responded with an urgent action and then a global campaign. 
Our thoughts at the time were like those of many others in El Salvador: surely the state would use common sense and compassion, by guaranteeing this young woman her human right to life. 
We hope that the judges are fully aware of the fact that the world is watching, waiting, and hoping that they do not fail this critical test of their capacity to protect and uphold human rights. Their apparent indifference so far to Beatriz’s suffering has increased concern to the extent that their reputation is now on the line. 
This is a case with discrimination at its heart: Beatriz requires a medical treatment that only women and girls need, and she is poor. It doesn’t take a lot to figure out what would have happened if she had resources or influential connections. 
As the days and weeks have passed, I have been horrified to see Salvadoran officials and judges standing by, watching Beatriz suffer pain and anguish, and not knowing if she will survive the pregnancy. The United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have all demanded that the state immediately ensure Beatriz access to the life-saving treatment she needs. Beatriz herself has made a recorded plea to the president. 
 Listen to Beatriz’s plea to the president 
It is utterly inexcusable for the Salvadoran authorities to deny life-saving treatment to Beatriz. Each official should remember that they have individual responsibility – and potential culpability – for their part in the pain and suffering their failure to act causes. 
Dozens of women and men have taken to protesting outside the Supreme Court, asking for justice for Beatriz.  When I was last there, some were shouting a stark warning to the judges inside. “Indifference kills and silence is its accomplice!”  Others stood with signs which simply asked the question : “Who will guarantee Beatriz’s human rights?” 
Two months on since the request to save her life was first made, we still don’t know the answer to this question. We urge the authorities to act now to save Beatriz’s life. 
Each official and judge who does not do what they can to save Beatriz, or to prevent her suffering severe health damage, risks having blood on their hands. 
	The world is watching El Salvador. Day by day the pressure is mounting on the authorities and judges to do the right thing, and help a young woman who desperately wants to live.

It is utterly inexcusable for the Salvadoran authorities to deny life-saving treatment to Beatriz. Each official should remember that they have individual responsibility – and potential culpability – for their part in the pain and suffering their failure to act causes. 
,  
Dozens of women and men have taken to protesting outside the Supreme Court, asking for justice for Beatriz.  When I was last there, some were shouting a stark warning to the judges inside. “Indifference kills and silence is its accomplice!”  Others stood with signs which simply asked the question : “Who will guarantee Beatriz’s human rights?” 
,  
Two months on since the request to save her life was first made, we still don’t know the answer to this question. We urge the authorities to act now to save Beatriz’s life. 
,  
Each official and judge who does not do what they can to save Beatriz, or to prevent her suffering severe health damage, risks having blood on their hands. 
,  
	The world is watching El Salvador. Day by day the pressure is mounting on the authorities and judges to do the right thing, and help a young woman who desperately wants to live.

Anne Marie Sam of the Nak’azdli First Nation stands near her great-grandfather’s grave on the shores of the Nation River and points to Mt. Milligan, site of a gold and copper mine now under construction. 
Walking up the long dusty road to where the Mt Milligan gold and copper mine is now under construction, Anne Marie Sam of the Nak’azdli First Nation describes the many ways – including hunting, fishing and gathering plant medicines – that her family has lived on the land that is now consumed by the mine’s footprint. 
“This mine,” she says, “means that my children will not have the opportunity to grow up experiencing that same connection to the land.” 
The Mt. Milligan mine, located northwest of Prince George in British Columbia is expected to begin operation this year and to continue production for at least 22 more years. 
The mine affects lands, rivers and streams that are the subject of unresolved legal claims involving four First Nations, including Nak’azdli, which has never entered into a treaty with Canada.  In their traditions, the people of Naka’zdli follow a Keyoh system in which responsibility to care for specific areas of the territory are handed down with the family from one generation to the next. The Mt. Milligan mine development consumes most of Anne Marie Sam’s family Keyoh. 
The mine development was approved by environmental assessments carried out by the provincial and federal governments. The federal assessment acknowledged the importance of Indigenous peoples’ multigenerational use and traditional management of the land. Nonetheless, the assessment concluded that the mine would not cause significant harm because this use could resume some day in the future after mining ends. 
 
 
Over the weekend of May 18th, Anne Marie Sam was one of five women from Nak’azdli who the mining company allowed to enter the construction site to hold a ceremony to honour the land. At each of the four corners of the land, they offered prayers for the water, animals and plants and for the safety and well-being of the mine workers and the company and for the neighboring First Nation of McLeod Lake. 
“We’ve never had to hold a ceremony like this before,” says Anne Marie. “In our language, we don’t say good-bye. We say, we will see you again. That’s what we were saying to the land. In 20 years when they close the mine, we’re the ones who will still be here.” 
While the ceremony was being carried out, I was honoured to join other Nak’azdli members, Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, local Amnesty International organizer Seiko Watanabe, and representatives of many other environmental and social justice organizations in holding a solidarity vigil outside on the mine road. 
The Mt. Milligan story has important lessons for the protection of human rights in Canada. Mt. Milligan is the first new mine to enter production in the region in many years, but it is part of a massive new wave of resource development being promoted by the provincial and federal governments. In northern BC alone, more than 100 major projects in mining, oil and gas, forestry and other industries are currently planned or under development, including the proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline which will also affect the people of Nak’azdli. Across Canada, the federal government predicts that more than 600 major resource development projects will get underway in the coming decade. Almost all this planned development will affect lands and waters of continued importance to First Nations, Inuit and Métis cultures, societies and economies. 
The federal government points to the environmental assessment process as a crucial measure to ensure Indigenous peoples’ rights are protected in resource development decisions. But how effective is this protection, if the assessment process can simply ignore the impact of denying a generation of children and youth the opportunity to practice their traditions? 
 
Roads built on either side of Rainbow Creek 
Talking around the fire I was reminded of another powerful ceremony I had attended just days earlier, and much farther to the south. In the Town of Williams Lake, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission held a powerful, moving ceremony to honour the children taken from their families – and their land – in order to attend residential school. Residential school survivors told powerful, moving stories of the continued loss that is being felt, both because of the terrible individual abuse that was inflicted, and because of the much broader loss of culture and tradition. As part of the ceremony, the town of Williams Lake raised a monument quoting Canada’s residential school apology.

Attempts to hold a Pride in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv have repeatedly run into roadblocks because of very real threats of violence and a police force unwilling to protect participants. 
And in South Africa, homophobic hatred all too often leads to violent attacks and killings which frequently go uninvestigated by police. 
These three countries provide just a snapshot of the types of discrimination and violence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people the world over. In many countries, such a climate of prejudice increases the likelihood of physical attacks and other human rights abuses against people because of their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. 
On 17 May, to mark the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHO), Amnesty International supporters worldwide will take action to highlight the human rights situation of LGBTI people in these three countries and show solidarity. 
 
Around the world, individuals face numerous human rights violations because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. 
LGBTI people face disproportionately high levels of discrimination when accessing healthcare, education, employment and housing. In many countries, consensual same-sex conduct remains criminalized and LGBTI people are often subjected to violence, harassment, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, imprisonment, and torture. Several countries still impose the death penalty for same-sex consensual relations, and it is at risk of being introduced in some others. 
They are also denied the right to freedom of expression and assembly – in some countries, activists organizing Pride events face bans by city authorities or inadequate police protection when the Prides are threatened with violence. 
IDAHO was created in 2004 to draw the attention of policymakers, opinion leaders, social movements, the public and the media to such issues. It takes place on 17 May each year to commemorate the World Health Organization’s decision in 1990 to declassify “homosexuality” as a mental disorder. 
“Simply because of who they are, LGBTI people in many countries face discrimination, violence and fear as a part of their daily lives,” said Emily Gray of the Gender, Sexuality and Identity Programme at Amnesty International. 
  
 “On the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, Amnesty International is calling on thousands of activists to make a strong show of solidarity to help change attitudes and realities in Jamaica, Ukraine and South Africa.” 
  
In Jamaica, consensual same-sex conduct between men continues to be criminalized and punishable by up to 10 years behind bars. While these laws are rarely implemented, the resulting climate of prejudice increases the likelihood of discrimination, physical attacks and other human rights abuses against people because of their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Such discrimination translates into frequent incidents of arbitrary arrests, detention and ill-treatment of LGBTI people. Access to healthcare, housing, employment and other services is also limited by disproportionately high levels of discrimination. 
Major public figures – including popular musicians, religious leaders, politicians and others – have pandered to high levels of homophobia by speaking out in favour of continuing discrimination against the Caribbean island’s LGBTI people. 
During the December 2011 electoral campaign, the current Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, stated that “no one should be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation”, and that the “government should provide protection” for LGBTI people. 
Amnesty International activists are using Twitter to remind the Prime Minister and her government of the urgency to take concrete action to back up this pledge. 
Meanwhile in Europe, LGBTI people in Ukraine face negative stereotyping and discriminatory treatment by members of the public and officials. Religious leaders and elected government officials have been known openly to make discriminatory comments about LGBTI people. 
No Pride march has ever taken place in Ukraine. A march planned in the capital Kyiv last May was cancelled because of threats of violence against participants from members of the public, and a police failure to put adequate security measures in place. 
Other public events by LGBTI groups have been banned for fear of eliciting negative reactions from the public, and LGBTI activists have been prosecuted for exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
There are fears that a Pride planned for 25 May this year may once again be cancelled because of threats and inadequate protection measures from the police. 
Amnesty International fully supports Kyiv Pride. It has been working with the organizers to ensure local authorities allow it to go ahead without hindrance, and will send a delegation to support the march. 
Activists are also focusing on South Africa, where hate crimes targeting individuals because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity are all too common. 
Between June and November 2012 alone, Amnesty International documented seven murders of LGBTI people in the country – though the actual number is likely to be much higher. 
There is an apparent disconnect between South Africa’s progressive laws on LGBTI issues, and practical access to justice for LGBTI individuals who are victims of hate crimes. This is evident in the failure of the police to investigate adequately cases of violence against LGBTI people and the continuing climate of fear they endure, especially in townships and rural areas. On the whole, impunity for such hate crimes pervades. 
On and around this 17 May, Amnesty International supporters will send personal messages of solidarity to LGBTI activists in South Africa, to stand together against hate crimes. 
“Amnesty International believes that all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be able to exercise their full human rights without fear of violence, discrimination and persecution,” said Emily Gray.

The reality of what is happening in Colombia, the spectacularly beautiful and diverse country with whom Canada is now linked via a free trade deal, is hard to take in. The immensity of it is shocking. According to the Constitutional Court of Colombia, at least a third of Indigenous Peoples in the South American country are threatened with physical or cultural “extermination” amidst armed conflict in their territory by third parties and grave human rights violations linked to efforts to take control of their resource-rich lands. 
You can raise your voice for action 
The Embera-Katio are among those threatened with destruction. Some years ago, I had the enormous privilege to spend time in Embera Katio villages on the tributaries of the Sinu River, meeting community leaders of great integrity, watching children frolic joyfully in the river while their mothers wove intricate beadwork, sharing food and conversation with parents dedicated, like parents everywhere, to providing for their families, and learning about a spirituality that values the sharing of the earth’s bounty for the well-being of all. It is horrifying to me that all of this could be wiped out by violence, indifference and greed. 
But you don’t need to have travelled to Colombia to share in the belief that we cannot stand by in silence and allow the destruction of other human beings, their cultures, traditional practices, livelihoods, languages and ancestral knowledge. 
Our sisters and brothers with the National Indigenous Organizations of Colombia (ONIC) have asked for the help of Canadians with an appeal which is impossible to ignore: “The survival of Indigenous Peoples with dignity in Colombia is in all of our hands.” 
With that in mind, today Amnesty International Canada launches a Week of Action for the Rights and Survival of Indigenous Peoples in Colombia. 
The timing is no coincidence. May 15 is the deadline for the Canadian government to report to Parliament on human rights impacts of a free trade deal with Colombia that has opened the doors for Canadian companies to join a resource extraction boom amidst ongoing armed conflict and human rights violations. 
Last year, the Canadian government delivered an empty report that said nothing about the human rights emergency facing Indigenous peoples. This year, it is imperative that grave threats to the very survival Indigenous peoples are acknowledged and addressed. It is imperative that all of us raise our voices to demand such action before it is too late. The Canadian government must make good on its promise to use its special relationship with Colombia to press for solutions. It must also take steps to ensure that Canadian companies are not contributing to or profiting from violations of Indigenous rights in Colombia. 
There are many ways you can get involved this week and beyond. 
Visit www.amnesty.ca to take a look at photo messages from Indigenous women and men in Colombia and the moving story they tell. ACT NOW to add your signature to our online petition. Then take part in THIS IS WHAT WE DEMAND – an exciting new campaign to deliver eye-catching messages of concern about the situation in Colombia. Send your own photo message to makeitvisible@amnesty.ca and be sure to post it on your Facebook page or use your twitter account to encourage your followers to take part as well. Your help gathering support for this campaign is absolutely vital. 
During our Week of Action, we will be hosting a visit by Maria Patricia Tobón Yagarí of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia and taking her to meet with government officials and MPs. Ms Tobon Yagari will share the moving testimony she delivered nine weeks ago to a special hearing of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington. Supporters in Ottawa and Toronto will have the opportunity to hear this courageous human rights defender in person (see details in the events listing below). We’ll be sure to use this blog to share her message to Canadians. 
There are other exciting events taking place during the Week of Action. Join us at one of the events below.

Photo: An Ixil woman is sworn in before giving her testimony in the genocide case against former de facto president Efrain Rios Montt, who listens via headphones in the background. On May 10, Rios Montt was sentenced to 80 years for genocide and crimes against humanity. By Roderico Y Díaz   
I’m still reeling from being in the courtroom last Friday when supporters of justice burst into applause as Guatemalan ex de facto president Efrain Rios Montt became the first former head of state in Latin America to be convicted on charges of genocide.   
More than a hundred witnesses testified during the trial, most of whom brought first hand accounts to build the case that Rios Montt and his military high command enacted policies to exterminate the indigenous Ixil population between 1982 and 1983. During those years, strategic military operational plans were developed and authorized by the government that identified an entire ethnic group as subversive, claiming they formed the support bases for guerilla forces waging a counter-insurgency war against the government. 
	What transpired was a military-led campaign that systematically used scorched earth tactics to try and destroy the Ixil population. These tactics were categorized by extreme sexual violence against women, the elderly and young girls, mass extrajudicial killings including of pregnant women and children, the razing of houses and crops and the killing of livestock. Survivors were forced to flee into the mountains where they were further persecuted by the military and many died from hunger. Those who returned were forced to live in army-controlled model villages and many were forcibly recruited into civil defence patrols. 
	Hearing first-hand accounts of such extreme forms of violence will stick with me for the rest of my life. So too, will the cries of justice and tears that were overflowing in the courtroom when the former president was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison for genocide, with an additional 30 years for crimes against humanity. Although Judge Yassmin Barrios absolved former Head of Military Intelligence Jose Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez of the same crimes, she gave authorization to the Public Prosecutor’s Office to continue to investigate others who may bear responsibility for the genocide in addition to Rios Montt. 
	Here in Guatemala, many people are calling this a turning point for the country, and describing this landmark conviction as an indescribably important crack in the dam of impunity. Despite the ludicrous legal challenges that the defense brought forward and decades of denial by the elite and politically powerful in Guatemala, the plaintiffs triumphed against all odds, achieving both truth and justice. 
	The respect and admiration I have for so many people who have risked everything to bring the case forward is not easily put into words, particularly for the survivors that make up the Association for Justice and Reconciliation. It has been a tremendous privilege to join friends and allies in the human rights community here in Guatemala to salute and celebrate their tireless, courageous work.  
	Today, however, in the public hearing on reparations – essentially the nitty gritty of how Guatemala is going to honour the victims, acknowledge what happened, provide financial compensation and assure that the words “never again” mean something – there was a gaping omission. The judge ordered public apologies, the creation of memorial and cultural centres, the inclusion of this court decision in the public school curriculum, amongst other things. But there was no mention about the vexed issue of access to land. 
	In Guatemala, as in many parts of the world, unequal access to land is the root cause of much disparity. It continues to fuel conflict, struggle for change and violent repression against those who are forcibly evicted off of ancestral land to make way for monoculture plantations used to grow crops for export or biofuels, or for mega resource extraction. 
	For the Rios Montt conviction to truly be a turning point to a more just society, connections need to be publically made between the repression of the past and the repression of the present. 
	In the last few years, attacks against human rights defenders have skyrocketed, particularly those who are resisting transnational resource extraction. The policies of the current president Otto Perez Molina, himself a retired General and an adamant genocide denier, have been to use the force of the military to enact states of siege to suspend the constitutional rights of those resisting the encroachment of mining and hydroelectric companies. 
	Claudia Samayoa from the Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders spoke eloquently when she said, “We really hope that we will have a change in Guatemala. From now, we will start to recognize that what is happening today with … mining or exploration without due consultation is part of the same idea of genocide. It’s the same racism. It’s the same idea that people are not worthy of decision-making. So, if we start learning [from] the lessons of this trial, we will change as a country. And we really hope that we can help move forward our country, not from [a place of] silence but from the truth.” 
	Making those connections between the past and present is incredible important, and the implications of this trial are far-reaching. For now, people are celebrating this historic decision in Guatemalan history, where a national court has finally declared what survivors have been saying all along: Si, hubo genocidio. Yes, there was genocide.

Today I attended the first hearing in the trial of 12 people, including three leading activists, at a Dar Al Qadaa Al-Ali court. They are accused of attacking and burning the campaign headquarters of former presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq on 28 May 2012. 
	Amnesty International fears that the activists are being pursued in a politically motivated case, which comes amid the Egyptian authorities’ crackdown on freedom of expression and dissent. 
During the hearing attended by a number of human rights lawyers, opposition activists, international observers from the EU and other diplomatic representatives, supporters and friends of the accused, the five defendants who appeared in court vehemently denied all charges. The judge postponed the case to 3 September responding to the defence lawyers’ request for access to the entire case file, and calling in witnesses. 
	Among the defendants present today were prominent opposition activists. 
	Two of the activists, siblings Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mona Seif, are known for their ardent opposition to Ahmed Shafiq. They are also well-known critics of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), President Mohamed Morsi, the ruling Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and the Muslim Brotherhood (MB). 
	Both have been harassed and/or arrested previously for voicing dissent and participating in demonstrations. 
	Alaa Abdel Fattah was arrested 13 November 2011 on charges of participating in violence during protests in front of the Maspero television building in Cairo, which led to the deaths of 27 people. He was detained until his release pending investigation in December that year. Amnesty International believes that Alaa Abd El Fattah was targeted by the SCAF because of his leading role as a blogger and activist. No convincing evidence was ever presented to substantiate the charges against him, which were finally dropped in April 2012. 
	More recently, he was summoned for questioning by the public prosecution in relation to protests in front of the headquarters of the MB in Cairo on 22 March. 
	Today, he told the court that he did not participate in the protest in front of Shafiq’s headquarters, and heard the news about the attack after it happened. 
	Mona Seif, one of the founders of Egypt’s “No to Military Trials” movement – and a nominee for this year’s Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders – was arrested and beaten by members of the armed forces during a sit-in in front of the Egyptian Cabinet offices in December 2011. In court, she explained that she was in downtown Cairo during the attack on Shafiq’s headquarters, based in a different neighbourhood of Greater Cairo. 
	Other defendants are also known for their opposition to the current government. Ahmed Abdallah and his 6 April Youth Movement initially supported Mohamed Morsi’s candidacy during the second round of Egypt’s presidential elections last year. But they grew increasingly critical of his policies and in November 2012 escalated their vocal opposition him, the FJP and the MB. 
	A turning point was the killing of Gaber Salah Gaber, a 17-year-old member of the movement, during protests in front of the Ministry of Interior on 20 November 2012- the first killing of an opposition protester during Morsi’s rule. 
	Two days later President Morsi issued a Constitutional Declaration granting himself unrestrained powers. Since then, members of the 6 April Movement have participated regularly in demonstrations against the President and the Ministry of Interior, and several of its members were arrested during demonstrations. 
	In recent months, Ahmed Abdallah has continued to actively denounce ongoing human rights abuses and in mobilizing public support. He told Amnesty International, and the court, that he was not present in front of Shafiq’s headquarters at the time of the attack. 
	Another defendant, Bahaa Abdelazim Bastawissi, a founding member of Democratic Front Party from Damanhour, was also in court today. He was arrested a number of times during Mubarak’s rule, including on 6 April 2008 for participating in protests. 
	Today, he denied the charges against him, stating that he was attempting to stop a fight, apparently in the vicinity of the attack. After being arrested on 28 May 2012, he was detained until 18 June, before being released pending investigations. He told Amnesty International that he was stripped and beaten by members of the security forces in the last days of his detention in Damanhour. 
	On 7 March this year, the North Giza Prosecution referred the activists and nine others to trial on charges of arson, damage to property, theft, and the use of violence in relation to the attack on the headquarters of former presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq on 28 May 2012. To substantiate its claims, the prosecution relied heavily on the alleged eyewitness testimony of seven people who included the police head of investigations. 
This case against the activists comes amid an alarming escalation of politically motivated cases, judicial harassment and arrests targeting opposition activists, journalists, bloggers, protesters and others by the Egyptian authorities. 
	This crackdown sends the message that dissent and opposition continue to carry a heavy price under Egypt’s first democratically elected President since the “25 January Revolution”, in a frightening reminder that the current government is mimicking its predecessors – whether the SCAF or the fallen President Hosni Mubarak.

When I lived in Zimbabwe last year, my friends and I would often talk politics. President Robert Mugabe had ruled the country for their entire lives. Our discussions focused on their frustration— frustration that genuine political engagement with civil society remained out of reach; frustration that public declarations and policy statements amounted to very little in practice; and frustration that the political process involved taking one step forward and two steps back.   
A step forward was taken in March, when a national referendum led to the adoption of a new constitution. Citing a “peaceful, successful, and credible” referendum, the European Union terminated sanctions against 81 Zimbabwean officials, leaving only 10 people on the list, including President Robert Mugabe. The new constitution limits the President to two five-year terms and includes a bill of rights which stipulates freedom of expression and freedom of the press. 
But there’s always the two steps back…accusations of referendum rigging, although not validated, have emerged, and sources have alleged that many individuals in rural areas refused to vote because they had never read or seen the draft constitution. In the run-up to the referendum, there were allegations of politically-motivated attacks on individuals distributing posters, intimidation of journalists, and police raids on the headquarters of non-governmental organizations. As well, prominent human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa was arbitrarily arrested at the office of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai on March 17, and released several days later. Amnesty International launched an urgent action and campaigned ardently for Mtetwa’s release. 
National elections are supposed to take place in the coming months. Voter registration began on April 29, but the election date has not been set. There have already been reports that the voter registration process has been comprised, with Zimbabwe Electoral Commission officials absent from many key registration centres in areas that are strongholds of the opposition party, leaving people unable to register.  
Although the new constitution represents a step forward towards a more decentralized and democratic Zimbabwe, the incidents of political violence surrounding the referendum and the problems emerging with voter registration represent two steps backwards. 
Amnesty International will keep a close eye on developments in Zimbabwe this year. We are concerned that violence could escalate during the election process, but we remain hopeful—hopeful that Zimbabwe can move forward and not take any steps back—hopeful for a just political process where the human rights of all are fully respected.

Here are 10 facts that show why the Central American country’s dark past is still relevant today. 1. Guatemala is located in Central America, bordering Mexico. Around...","1. Guatemala is located in Central America, bordering Mexico. Around half of its population is indigenous, including many Maya peoples. The country is one of the most unequal in the region – with high rates of illiteracy, infant mortality and malnutrition, particularly in the countryside. Organized crime and violence are also widespread. 
2. Between 1960 and 1996, Guatemala was immersed in a bloody internal armed conflict that pitted the army against guerrilla groups. More than 200,000 men, women and children were murdered or disappeared during this 36-year-long war, most of them were indigenous. 
3. General José Efraín Ríos Montt led the country’s military government between March 1982 and August 1983 – one of the bloodiest periods of the conflict when there was an aggressive campaign targeting anyone deemed to be supporting left-wing guerrillas. 
4. The conflict ended in 1996 with the signing of a Peace Accord in which the government pledged to clarify the truth about what had happened in the three decades of violence. In 1999, a report by the UN-sponsored Commission of Historical Clarification concluded that the Guatemalan state was responsible for 93 per cent of abuses. The Commission also said that in 1981 and 1982 genocide was committed by the State in the Ixil, Zacualpa, northern Huehuetenango and Rabinal areas of Guatemala, where between 70 and 90 percent of the communities were wiped out. 
5. This is the first time a former Guatemalan head of state is being tried for genocide. The case against Rios Montt has been ongoing since 2001, but has been subject to a number of obstacles, including numerous constitutional appeals filed on his behalf and his immunity as a member of congress, which he lost in January 2012. 
6. Rios Montt is charged with being the intellectual author of the death of 1,771 people, enforced displacement of 29,000, sexual abuse against 8 women and torture or at least 14. In March 2012, he was also charged with the death of 201 in Dos Erres, Peten, in December 1982 – no date has been yet set for the latest charges to be heard. 
7. The trial against Ríos Montt and General Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez – his former head of intelligence – started on 19 March 2013. On 18 April, in the final phase of the trial, after more than 100 witnesses and experts had appeared, a judge in a separate Court from the trial Court ordered the trial to be annulled and returned to a pre trial phase.     
8. The trial court reconvened on 19 April and refused to annul the trial, but did suspend proceedings until higher courts resolved the matter. After a series of rulings by higher courts, on 30 April the trial resumed. 
9. Former generals Mejia Victores – who was Defence Minister under Rios Montt and then succeeded him as president – and the former Army Chief of Staff, Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, have also been charged but the cases against them were suspended due to their health state. 
10. In August 2011, in one of the most recent trials against those responsible for massacres, four soldiers were sentenced to more than 6,000 years in prison for killing 250 people in the northern town of Dos Erres in 1982.

Guatemala is located in Central America, bordering...",",  
,  
,  
1. Guatemala is located in Central America, bordering Mexico. Around half of its population is indigenous, including many Maya peoples. The country is one of the most unequal in the region – with high rates of illiteracy, infant mortality and malnutrition, particularly in the countryside. Organized crime and violence are also widespread. 
,  
2. Between 1960 and 1996, Guatemala was immersed in a bloody internal armed conflict that pitted the army against guerrilla groups. More than 200,000 men, women and children were murdered or disappeared during this 36-year-long war, most of them were indigenous. 
,  
3. General José Efraín Ríos Montt led the country’s military government between March 1982 and August 1983 – one of the bloodiest periods of the conflict when there was an aggressive campaign targeting anyone deemed to be supporting left-wing guerrillas. 
,  
4. The conflict ended in 1996 with the signing of a Peace Accord in which the government pledged to clarify the truth about what had happened in the three decades of violence. In 1999, a report by the UN-sponsored Commission of Historical Clarification concluded that the Guatemalan state was responsible for 93 per cent of abuses. The Commission also said that in 1981 and 1982 genocide was committed by the State in the Ixil, Zacualpa, northern Huehuetenango and Rabinal areas of Guatemala, where between 70 and 90 percent of the communities were wiped out. 
,  
5. This is the first time a former Guatemalan head of state is being tried for genocide. The case against Rios Montt has been ongoing since 2001, but has been subject to a number of obstacles, including numerous constitutional appeals filed on his behalf and his immunity as a member of congress, which he lost in January 2012. 
,  
6. Rios Montt is charged with being the intellectual author of the death of 1,771 people, enforced displacement of 29,000, sexual abuse against 8 women and torture or at least 14. In March 2012, he was also charged with the death of 201 in Dos Erres, Peten, in December 1982 – no date has been yet set for the latest charges to be heard. 
,  
7. The trial against Ríos Montt and General Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez – his former head of intelligence – started on 19 March 2013. On 18 April, in the final phase of the trial, after more than 100 witnesses and experts had appeared, a judge in a separate Court from the trial Court ordered the trial to be annulled and returned to a pre trial phase.     
,  
8. The trial court reconvened on 19 April and refused to annul the trial, but did suspend proceedings until higher courts resolved the matter. After a series of rulings by higher courts, on 30 April the trial resumed. 
,  
9. Former generals Mejia Victores – who was Defence Minister under Rios Montt and then succeeded him as president – and the former Army Chief of Staff, Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, have also been charged but the cases against them were suspended due to their health state. 
,  
10. In August 2011, in one of the most recent trials against those responsible for massacres, four soldiers were sentenced to more than 6,000 years in prison for killing 250 people in the northern town of Dos Erres in 1982.

0,Guantánamo hunger strikes: Five steps the US government must take to end the injustice,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-guant%c3%a1namo-hunger-strikes-five-steps-the-us-government-must-take-to-end-the-injustice/,"“Given the uncertainty and anxieties surrounding their prolonged and apparently indefinite detention in Guantánamo, it is scarcely surprising that people’s frustrations boil over and they resort to such desperate measures.”  High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on the latest..."," 
“Given the uncertainty and anxieties surrounding their prolonged and apparently indefinite detention in Guantánamo, it is scarcely surprising that people’s frustrations boil over and they resort to such desperate measures.”  High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on the latest Guantánamo hunger strikes 
	In a matter of weeks, the number of detainees recognized by the Guantánamo authorities as being on hunger strike increased dramatically from fourteen detainees in mid-March to one hundred by the end of April. Twenty-three hunger strikers are now being “tube fed” and four of these detainees are in hospital. A number of those being force fed are reportedly detainees approved for transfer years ago by the US authorities.  In the wake of the US Navy sending forty more medical personnel to Guantánamo to respond to the hunger strike, the American Medical Association raised concerns with US Secretary of Defense Charles Hagel about the medical ethics of force feeding mentally competent hunger strikers. 
Hunger strikes – and the practice of force-feeding – began in Guantánamo in 2005 and have contented periodically since then. 
Whatever the initial trigger was for the current hunger strike, there is no escaping the backdrop to it: detainees being held year after year after year with no indication of when, if ever, they will be released or brought to trial. Distress and protest are predictable outcomes of treating detainees as if they have no human rights, essentially cut off from families and communities that are continents away, and their fate left to the whims of domestic politics with no consideration of international human rights law and principles. 
As early as January 2004, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) – the only outside agency with access to the Guantánamo detainees – issued a rare public statement noting that they had “observed a worrying deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of them.” In the intervening nine years, that warning has gone largely unheeded. On April 11, 2013, ICRC President Peter Maurer again went public calling on “the United States, including its Congress, [to] urgently find a way to resolve all pending humanitarian, legal and policy issues relating to the detention of persons held at Guantánamo Bay.” 
International criticism of Guantánamo now also includes many of the US government’s close allies. The UK government’s 2013 human rights report stated that “the indefinite detention without trial of persons in Guantánamo Bay is unacceptable and that the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay should be closed.” 
US President Obama has repeatedly promised to close down the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay and blames the US Congress for blocking the way.  Yet other options are clearly available. 
Here are five steps the US government can take right now to start to address the ongoing human rights violations: 
Review conditions at Guantánamo:	Pending resolution of the detentions, and without delaying that goal in any way, immediately conduct a detailed review of conditions of detention and of policies implemented in response to the hunger strike, including: evaluating cell-search, force-feeding and comfort item policies, and allowing full access to independent medical professionals, UN experts, and human rights organizations, and ensure all policies comply with international human rights law and medical ethics.  
Dedicate resources, ensure leadership:	A high-level White House position should be appointed to drive forward this issue, to coordinate review of all executive options, and to liaise with and ensure pressure on Congress. There should be no more delays, and no more excuses for the USA’s failure to meet its international human rights obligations. 
Expedite safe detainee transfers:	Dozens of the Guantánamo detainees have long been “approved for transfer” by the US authorities. Many are Yemeni nationals, who remain in limbo because of the moratorium on repatriation of Yemeni detainees imposed by the administration over three years ago. The administration should accept Senator Dianne Feinstein’s offer to help resolve the cases of the 86 detainees she has said were approved for transfer in the past and her call on the administration to review the repatriation moratorium. 
Apply a human rights framework:	Even if the US administration meets its commitment to close the Guantánamo detention facility, it apparently intends to hold at least 46 of the detainees indefinitely without charge or trial somewhere else on the basis of its flawed “global war” framework. This is unacceptable, as is the continuing resort to military commission trials that do not meet international standards. Congress and the administration should commit to addressing the detentions under a framework that complies with international human rights law and standards, something that has been missing from the outset. 
Charge and try detainees in civilian courts:	Detainees who are to be prosecuted should be charged and tried in ordinary federal civilian court, without recourse to the death penalty. Any detainees who are not to be charged and tried should be released. 	Any resolution of the injustice of Guantánamo will be incomplete without full accountability for the human rights violations that have been committed against detainees, including the crimes under international law of torture and enforced disappearance. Genuine access to meaningful remedy must be guaranteed to those who have been subjected to violations, and the use of secrecy and immunity to block accountability and remedy must be ended.

Governments and other organizations across the world are perfecting techniques to prevent journalists from shining a light on corruption and human rights abuses. From trumped-up charges, removing work licences to murder, here are 10 ways journalists are repressed and prevented from reporting freely and fairly. 
Physical attacks 
In some countries such as Syria, Turkmenistan and Somalia, governments, military forces and armed groups attack and even kill journalists who are seen to be critical of their policies and practices. 
Take Action Online Stop the targeting of journalists in the Syrian conflict! 
Read Amnesty’s report Shooting the Messenger: Journalists targeted in Syria 
	Last November, Palestinian cameramen Hussam Salameh and journalist Mahmoud al-Koumi, from the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV, were killed by a targeted Israeli missile strike on their car in Gaza City. Amnesty International found no evidence that either was anything other than a civilian journalist, despite claims by military authorities in Israel that both were “Hamas operatives”. 
In May 2012, 18-year-old citizen journalist Abd al-Ghani Ka’ake was fatally shot by a government sniper in Syria while filming a demonstration in Aleppo. Armed opposition groups have also attacked and killed journalists. 
Journalist Miguel Ángel López Velasco, his wife and their son were shot and killed at their home in Veracruz, Mexico, by unidentified gunmen in June 2011. He had previously received death threats. 
Abdihared Osman Aden, from Somalia, was shot dead by unidentified men while walking to work on 19 January 2013. He is one of at least 23 journalists killed in the country since 2011. 
Threat of prison 
Journalists also risk being charged under legislation that criminalizes the peaceful expression of views, or with trumped-up, politically motivated charges (such as possession of drugs and fraud) to stop them from reporting is common.

Take action Libya: drop charges against journalist Amara Abdalla al-Khattabi 
On 12 March 2013, Avaz Zeynali was found guilty of bribery, extortion by threats, failure to implement a court decision and tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in prison in Azerbaijan. He has regularly reported on corruption and criticised the President’s clampdown on the media and activists.   
In Iran, at least 18 journalists have been arrested since January 2013, accused of cooperating with “anti-revolutionary” media organizations outside Iran. Dozens of journalists and bloggers are now behind bars in Iran. 
On 5 February 2013, Abdiaziz Abdnur Ibrahim was sentenced to one-year imprisonment in Mogadishu, Somalia, for insulting a national institution after interviewing a woman who reported being raped by government forces. The case was quashed in March by the Supreme Court. 
In January 2012, journalists Reyot Alemu and Woubshet Taye were convicted of terrorism offences in Ethiopia. During the trial, access to lawyers was restricted, defendants were not provided with effective interpretation and evidence obtained under coercion was admitted. 
Harassment 
Many governments find that threatening journalists or their relatives is effective in silencing them. 
Relatives of the Voice of America reporter Negar Mohammadi, from Iran, have been banned from travelling and the passport of one of them was confiscated in February 2012. 
In Yemen, Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani has been under threat since early 2013 after he wrote articles about secret detention centres and torture by the First Armoured Division. Weapons were twice fired outside his home and he received anonymous phone calls asking him if he could hear the shooting. 
Musa Mohammad Auwal was arrested by the State Security Services in his home in Kaduna, Nigeria, last February, held for eight days and interrogated about his news organization and the whereabouts of his Editor-in-Chief (currently in hiding in fear of his life). He was released on bail.

Monitoring 
In countries including Cuba and China, activists and journalists find it particularly difficult to report on human rights issues because their communications can be monitored by state officials. 
In March 2012, Cuban blogger and journalist Yoani Sánchez was unable to receive text messages or calls during the Pope’s visit to the country.	 	In China many people were sentenced to long prison terms in 2012 for posting blogs or sending information that was deemed sensitive. 
In March 2013, the authorities in Saudi Arabia reportedly threatened to block access to Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and Line, if these telecommunication companies do not enable their encrypted applications to be monitored. 
Banning access to the internet 
Some repressive regimes seek to control internet access in order to regulate journalists’ activities. 
The authorities in China temporarily blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg websites and banned searches for ‘New York Times’ after the news organizations exposed controversial financial details of some of China’s leaders. 
Set up excessive libel laws 
Libel laws in countries can be misused in an attempt to prevent journalists from criticising government officials and powerful individuals. 
In Timor-Leste Oscar Maria Salsinha and Raimundo Oki were accused of “slanderous denunciations” after publishing articles on a District Prosecutor who allegedly received a bribe in a traffic accident case that occurred on 18 October 2011. 
In August 2012, Islam Affifi, editor of Egyptian newspaper El-Dostor, was brought to trial for publishing false information “insulting the President”. The trial is still continuing. 
The Palestinian Authority’s security forces in the West Bank and Hamas’ Internal Security in the Gaza Strip both have a record of interrogating and harassing journalists. In March 2013, Palestinian Mamdouh Hamamreh was sentenced to one year in prison for allegedly insulting President Mahmoud Abbas. He was released after the President pardoned him.   
Removing visas and work permits 
In some countries, including Syria, governments deny or remove visas from foreign journalists to stop them from investigating human rights abuses while national journalists face the same risk to their work permits.   
In 2011, Ayad Shabi’s permit was revoked in Syria after he failed to comply with official guidelines provided by the Ministry of Information on how to report on the protests. 
Andrzej Poczobut is serving a three-year suspended prison sentence in Belarus – imposed in July 2011 – on charges of “libelling the President” for articles about prisoners of conscience in Belarus. Under the conditions of this ruling he has to register with the police regularly and cannot leave the country. 
Last August a BBC journalist who had travelled to Gambia to report on a resumption of executions was held at the airport and told he had to leave the country, despite having authorization to be there.   
In May 2012, Al Jazeera English closed its Beijing bureau in China after the authorities refused to renew the visa of Melissa Chan, whose stories included reports on secret jails and forced abortions. 
Failure to investigate attacks against journalists 
By failing to bring to justice those responsible for attacks against journalists, governments send the message that preventing reporting on what they see as sensitive issues is permitted. 
One of the individuals accused of torturing journalist Nazeeha Saeed after she was arrested in Bahrain in 2011 was acquitted, despite forensic evidence of her torture. Nazeeha was detained and tortured after speaking out about the killing of a protester she witnessed at the Pearl Roundabout. 
In April 2012, Idrak Abbasov and Adalet Abbasov were hospitalized in Azerbaijan after they were attacked by around 25 state employees and police. They had tried to film illegal house demolitions on the outskirts of Baku. The attack was never fully investigated. 
No one has been brought to justice in Pakistan for the May 2011 abduction and killing of Saleem Shahzad. Just two days before his death Shahzad published a story on alleged al Qaeda infiltration of the military, one of the most sensitive and taboo topics in the country. 
Shutting down media outlets 
The authorities in many countries shut down newspapers and radio stations deemed critical of them. 
In the first two months of 2012, the authorities in Sudan suspended three newspapers using laws that allow them to ban any publication containing information considered a threat to national security. 
Last September, The Standard and Daily News newspapers in Gambia were forced to close after plain-clothed men suspected to be intelligence officers, entered their offices and ordered them to suspend all activities. 
In Somalia, in April 2013, the authorities in Puntland banned three radio stations in what is seen as the latest in a string of attacks on the media ahead of local elections. 
Promote smear attacks 
In many countries, governments promote smear attacks against journalists critical of the authorities. 
In Sri Lanka a state-sanctioned smear attack forced Gnanasiri Kottegoda to flee his home in 2012 and go into exile as his safety was compromised. 
Venezuelan Rayma Suprani has been receiving threats and insults via text message and social media sites. She thinks this is a coordinated attack due to her work as a political cartoonist and journalist.

Equal marriage is an important step for the LGBTQ community on the path towards equality, freedom from discrimination and the right to live with dignity. 
The path towards marriage equality has been a challenging one and the courageous and determined work of equal rights activists should be acknowledged.  LGBTQ individuals have faced many challenges, even within the activist community.  It is important to realize that the loving relationship between two individuals of the same gender is just as deserving of the legal and social recognition that comes with the term marriage as every other relationship. 
Dignity… It is such a powerful concept. It is so crucial to our well being and it is something that far too many people in the world have to fight for. The ability to walk down the street with our loved ones, free from fear of attack, free from leers and insults.  Marriage equality doesn’t negate these things entirely, but it does become a tool against the demonization of LGBTQ individuals. 
There is still so much work to be done. In many countries LGBTQ people face discrimination, violence, and legalized and systemic persecution.  In recent weeks Amnesty International has worked on cases involving such terrible things as the corrective rape and murder of a lesbian activist, helping a grieving mother find justice for her murdered son, and working to protect individuals in Eastern Europe as they organize a rights movement.  In many countries it is still illegal to be homosexual, with sentences ranging from high fines to the death penalty. Even in countries with strong human rights laws, transgendered people face legalized discrimination and are often excluded from human rights progresses.  With the passing of these marriage equality laws in Uruguay, New Zealand, and France, the global LGBTQ community is given something very important; hope. Hope that one day everyone can live their lives with dignity and equality. 
Arundhati Roy once said “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.” Pride season is upon us. It is a time where we can reflect on the battle for equality that has been fought and continues to be fought for. It is a time when we can celebrate our successes and embrace the wonderful diversity that is our community.  Take a moment during these celebrations to reflect on this coming world. A world that you are helping to create. Take a moment to welcome her. 
Congratulations again to Uruguay, New Zealand, and France.

	by Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada 
 It is so crucial that Amnesty International makes sure that we will not forget this terrible crisis; because many would like it to be forgotten. 
We have heard that sentiment numerous times over the past few days as we have been in and out of the offices of governments that are members of the UN Security Council, and various UN officials and experts.  I have been in New York for three days this week, with Amnesty colleagues from our offices here and in London, pushing and prodding for international action to bring the grave human rights crisis and humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan’s Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States to an end. 
 Amnesty report on Sudan reveals deadly indiscriminate bombing of civilian population 
Specifically, we have come to New York to launch our new report, Sudan: Civilians Caught in Unending Crisis in Southern Kordofan.  The report lays out the grim and troubling findings, as well as recommendations for action, coming out of our research mission to South Sudan and to Sudan’s  volatile Southern Kordofan State in January of this year.  
The report makes it clear that Sudan’s campaign of indiscriminate aerial bombings, underway for close to two years, has led to overwhelming numbers of civilian deaths and injuries.  The wrenching accounts range from two young brothers cut down by shrapnel while playing under a tree to a 90 year old grandmother who was so badly torn apart by a Sudanese bomb that her neighbour had to gather up her body parts. 
Beyond death and injury the report also highlights the deep crisis of inescapable hunger, as well as lack of water and proper health care, that has been unleashed through the combination of the relentless bombing campaign and the Sudanese government’s refusal to allow humanitarian assistance into the ravaged area. 
Be it from hunger, from bomb attacks that have occurred or fear of bomb attacks that might be coming, around 300,000 people are now displaced either within Southern Kordofan or in remote refugee camps across the border in harsh and isolated corners of South Sudan.  They are particularly vulnerable amidst the continuing violence and hardship. 
 Sudan crisis needs response from United Nations 
This is not new. This is a crisis that began in June 2011.  But it is a crisis that has governments stalemated.  That is why we have come to New York.  The UN Security Council has a key role to play.  Yet divisions and politics take precedence over rights and safety.  In much the same way that China and Russia have blocked strong UN action on Syria; they and a few allies have stood up for the government in Khartoum rather than people suffering on the ground in Southern Kordofan. 
We are here to help build the pressure for action.  We need to see the Security Council finally condemn the aerial bombardments and blocked humanitarian aid for what they are – clear violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law – which must end; now.  We need to see the Security Council establish an independent inquiry into the abuses.  And we need to see the Security Council extend the Sudan arms embargo that currently only applies to Darfur, to the whole of Sudan. 
 Amnesty International is pressing for action 
That is why we are here.  That is what the scores of people whose stories we heard in villages, towns and displacement settlements throughout Southern Kordofan demand.  Every meeting I have been in and out of, I have remembered the words of feisty Khadija, after she described gathering up her neighbour’s body parts.  She sent us off with the exhortation that we had to find a way to ‘stop the planes.’ 
We haven’t done so yet.  But our information, including Khadija’s story, has been helpful and timely for many members of the Security Council who are concerned about this crisis.  And it has certainly strengthened their resolve to find a way forward. 
We will now build on that resolve.  Our three days at the UN will now be a springboard for pressure from around the world, some directed at the Security Council, much concentrated on the governments and armed groups at the heart of the conflict, and certainly a great deal focused on the African Union, which has assumed a leadership role in responding to this grievous situation, but has failed to date to deliver much progress. 
With targets for our lobbying spread across the globe, the global strength and presence of Amnesty International is obviously incredibly valuable.  Voices will speak out from Canada, Chile, Thailand and the Netherlands, but also from across Africa – all demanding that the indiscriminate bombings end and the humanitarian aid begins. 
 Support from Amnesty members gives hope for civilians in Sudan 
Thank you for your support of this work.  Through your generosity and concern I have been able to be on the ground twice in the past year to hear directly from Khadija and countless others.  I have been able to follow up at the UN and in various world capitals, pressing our demands.  I know that without those efforts, made possible through your support, there is a very real risk that this crisis would have been forgotten.  But it hasn’t been.  Governments are feeling increasingly uncomfortable.  And that can be, must be the beginning of change. 
I cannot yet report to Khadija that we have stopped the planes.  But I am sure that we are getting closer.

“We can start with our future, our children, teach them love instead of hate… Violence, it’s easy to teach violence and hate. Turn that around and teach love, empathy, and we wouldn’t be here today grieving.” 	– Glen Wilson, Father of CJ Morningstar Fowler, a 16-year-old member of the Gitanmaax First Nation, whose body was found outside Kamloops, British Columbia, in December 2012.	  
This week upwards of 500 people from across Canada—women and men, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, survivors of violence and their allies—came together in Edmonton, Alberta, for a national meeting on ending violence against Indigenous women in Canada. Participants rejected complacency and discussed ways in which to move toward concrete action to end the violence. I was honored to participate in this important meeting on behalf of Amnesty International. 
Meeting participants recognized that the causes of violence are many and include the inter-generational impacts of the residential school system, poverty, a lack of adequate housing, the high percentage of Indigenous children in care, the growing number of youth and adults in the correctional system, the lack of adequate funding for women’s shelters…and the list goes on… There was talk of some of the creative and innovative Indigenous-led grassroots programs to prevent violence and provide services to victims of violence. 
Some of the most challenging discussions surrounded the work of the newly created Parliamentary Committee tasked with studying the issue of violence against Indigenous women in Canada. What became clear is that how the Committee carries out its work is just as important as what it does. Requests were made to include elders at the core of the Committee’s work, and to make sure that the families of missing and murdered women and other survivors of violence are front and centre. Young people raised their voices, and asked that youth voices be part of the Committee’s work. Perhaps the clearest message is that people need time to speak, to grieve, to share, and to heal, and that this may need to take a different form and a different time commitment than is usual for other similar committees. 
Committee members will need to provide a space for survivors of violence to raise their voices, and it will need to do so in a way that is attuned to the cultural practices of those it is listening to. The Committee will then need to look at how to take action based on the testimony it hears. To honor those who have died, and those who continue to live with grief, nothing less than a national action plan to combat violence is needed. 
Survivors of violence shared their stories in Edmonton this week. From this sharing came strength and solidarity. In the words of Josie Nepinak, Executive Director of the Awo Taan Healing Lodge Society in Alberta, and a woman who has lost family members to violence, “I feel the love and the power of all of you. There are no easy answers but together we will keep this issue alive and move forward.” 
We will keep moving forward, and Amnesty International will continue to stand with the families of those who have gone missing or been murdered, and other victims of violence, on the walk forward to justice.

By Lamri Chirouf, Amnesty International’s delegate in the Occupied Palestinian Territories 
Last month we drove northwest from Ramallah to visit the small village of Budrus, which gained international attention a decade ago when residents started protesting against the fence/wall erected by Israel. 
Regular protests there against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank continue, and clashes between village youths and members of the Israeli army have become a weekly, if not daily, occurrence. 
The main reason behind the protests is still the wall, described by the Israeli government as a security fence and by Budrus residents, and Palestinians throughout the West Bank, as an ‘apartheid wall’ and a way for the Israeli government to annex more Palestinian lands. 
The majority of the wall is located inside the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). In Budrus, it consists of rolls of barbed wire, multiple fences and sensors, and a road on the other side patrolled by Israeli military jeeps, all of which work to separate villagers from their farming lands. 
There are no Israeli settlements or towns nearby, but Israeli troops regularly enter the village.  The encounters between them and Budrus residents can be fatal. 
We visited the fresh grave of a 16-year-old boy, Samir ‘Awad, buried in the cemetery next to his school in the west of the village, about half a mile from the wall. 
Scattered between the graves were different kinds of tear gas canisters shot by the Israeli army during confrontations. 
Witnesses and village authorities told us that Samir’s life was cut short on 15 January 2013, when he was shot by Israeli soldiers with live ammunition, after he went through an opening in the first barbed wire fence while hanging out with his friends after finishing their exams. 
“We used to go down to the fence and throw rocks at the sensors and try to cut parts of it. It is our way to protest the occupation,” Samir’s friend told Amnesty International. 
Witnesses we spoke to claimed that the soldiers had ambushed the youths before shooting Samir in the back and head from close range without giving him a chance to get out of harm’s way. An inquiry by B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organization, found that the soldiers were not in any danger and shot Samir ‘Awad in contravention of open-fire regulations. This would mean that it was an unlawful killing. 
The Israeli authorities’ first obligation is to conduct a thorough, independent, prompt and effective investigation, but Israel’s military investigations consistently fail to meet these international standards. Even though Israel’s military police have opened an investigation into Samir’s death, village residents believe that those responsible for killing him will not be held to account, as in so many other cases throughout the OPT. 
This climate of impunity allows for daily abuses by Israeli forces in the OPT. 
Villagers in Budrus told us that the whole population suffers from the effects of tear gas every time there is a confrontation with the Israeli army. The soldiers use it extensively, including inside the village, often firing directly at villagers and their homes even though this is against army regulations. Villagers choke on the gas and some have been hit by gas canisters and injured. 
We had a taste of this ourselves. That afternoon in the cemetery, we had a panoramic view of a confrontation between several youths and a number of soldiers. 
Three youths started walking towards four army vehicles parked behind the wall, throwing stones. However, before they got close to them they were intercepted by two soldiers fully equipped with weapons who entered the village through a gate in the wall, followed by a military vehicle. The soldiers began firing large amounts of tear gas. 
My colleague filmed the beginning of the confrontation. As the tear gas reached us, many of the children around me started running away from the gas towards their homes. 
My eyes started to water and burn with a stinging irritation, and I started to find it difficult to breathe.  My colleague who was filming had made good use of a scarf to cover his mouth and nose, but he was also suffering. His eyes were visibly watery and red and he could barely keep them open. I suggested he move away but he insisted on continuing to film as the soldiers descended on the four youth while firing more tear gas at them. 
I decided to move away as the pain in my eyes was worsening, as were my breathing problems. I planned to walk as far away as possible until I could find an area in the village free from tear gas, then wait for my colleague to join me. 
As I walked through the village I came across a group of children who had been playing football when I passed them earlier. They had stopped their game, covered their faces, and were rushing to their homes. 
One of the children turned to look at me on the threshold of his house and said: “The gas affects us indoors too”. 
I continued walking eastward, but the tear gas drifted in the same direction. When I reached the easternmost end of the village I realised that it was wishful thinking that I could escape its effects. 
As I stood there waiting, my eyes were still in pain and the banging of the tear gas launchers could still be heard. The launcher was still shooting canisters when my colleague finally joined me about 40 minutes after the beginning of the incident. He had left the scene soon after I did, going to a home to interview a boy who had been injured in a previous confrontation with the army, but even inside, he said he could still feel the gas. 
This persistent use and abuse of tear gas doesn’t make the headlines, but nobody should have to live day after day in such conditions, and the soldiers responsible for these daily abuses should be held accountable.

	My Neighbour: Hamid Ghassemi-Shall 
 
I live in Toronto’s east end, a neighbourhood known as Leslieville. It’s between The Beach and Riverdale (where Degrassi was set). My neighbourhood is typically urban. There are a lot of streetcars, buses and older houses. The local elementary school is old enough to have an honour roll of former students who paid with their lives during the Great War and World War II. I didn’t grow up here (I grew up in London, ON) – but I quite like this neighbourhood – and I’ve lived in a few around Toronto. 
	A few years ago I had the honour of taking on a role with Amnesty International Canada, as the English-Speaking Branch Coordinator for the Campaign to Abolish the Death Penalty. If I hadn’t taken on that role I would probably have continued my main contributions to Amnesty International – a small donation each month and writing faxes, emails and letters to support Urgent Actions for people at risk of execution or other violation of their rights. 
	Taking on the role I knew I would take on a liasion job. I would be the connection for many Canadian members and the International Secretariat in the UK. I would have to reach out to connect with other Canadian NGOs who also work on the death penalty and justice issues. I would be a subject matter expert for some things. What I did not anticipate though, was finding out that a neighbour would be facing the death penalty. 
	As far as I know, I never met Hamid Ghassemi-Shall – but I never shopped for shoes in The Beach. The Beach is one of the most popular regions of the city though – little boutiques make it one of those places everyone walks their dog, pushes strollers, enjoys the sun on a patio and runs into old friends. Hamid could pass you on the street today and you would probably not think anything unusual. If you had gone into his shop you would have found a guy with a broad smile offering to help you find a pair of shoes. 
	Like many of us, Hamid came to Canada from another country. He met and fell in love with Antonella Mega. They have a house just a few blocks from where I live. But when I say they, one half is missing. Hamid has not been home with his wife for nearly five years. Instead Hamid has faced the horror of a politically set-up death sentence. A Canadian, a neighbour, facing execution on trumped-up charges. 
	Whether you are for or against the death penalty, if you are Canadian, Hamid’s story must strike a chord. Hamid is a Canadian citizen who worked in a small business. His elderly mother had health issues. Like any dutiful son he visited his mum when she was sick. In Hamid’s case, that meant traveling to Iran, where he was born. While on that visit to his mother, his brother was arrested and charged with ‘espionage.’ The Iranian government couldn’t charge espionage without someone to send information to – so they picked-up Hamid and his own horror began. 
Iran’s record on human rights abuse is extensive. Amnesty International’s annual 2012 report on human rights found that in Iran political suspects were “frequently convicted, sometimes in the absence of defence lawyers, on the basis of ‘confessions’ or other information allegedly obtained under torture during pre-trial detention. Courts accepted such ‘confessions’ as evidence without investigating how they were obtained.”  At trial Hamid was convicted on the basis of an “email exchange” – the evidence of which was tested and analysed by his lawyer and shown to be a complete fabrication. In January 2010 Hamid’s brother died in prison, reportedly of stomach cancer. Despite reviews by Iranian courts Hamid`s death sentence has not been lifted. His life is quite literally at risk of being taken by a regime known for secret executions (and public executions), the execution of minors and of countless political opponents. 
	Not long after Hamid’s conviction I met Antonella, his very brave wife. Antonella gets limited communications from her husband. As you can imagine, an Iranian prison is not a place where phones are provided to each “guest” – it is a hard place where torture and deaths in custody are routine and a country which is second only to China in the total number of executions in recent years. 
Amnesty International has just released our Annual Report on the death penalty. The new report covers statistics and important developments over 2012. The Statistics from 2012 on Iran are not good. There were at least 314 officially recognised executions in Iran in 2012 – of which 71% were for ‘drugs offences’ (which like political crimes, are not lethal crimes and outside of international law in terms of crimes that may be capital. 
	The continued existence of the death penalty is what enables regimes like that in Iran to literally exterminate political opposition and to keep citizens in fear for their lives from the government. Execution of a human being is not an authority anyone should have – whether individual or the state. This is why international efforts to abolish the death penalty are so important. 
Canada has fallen surprisingly short on such efforts since 2006. When the United Nations General Assembly first held a call for a universal moratorium on executions with a view to abolition, Canada was widely expected to not only vote in favour, but to join all other long-term abolitionist countries in co-sponsoring the document before the vote. In 2012, the fourth of these calls was made. Again Canada, while voting in favour, refused to co-sponsor. An important gesture of support that costs nothing for the Canadian government to endorse. 
	A recent Angus-Reid opinion survey of Canadian opinion on the death penalty reveals that many hold conflicting opinions of capital punishment and the majority hold beliefs that are not supported by the facts. While a majority appeared to support hypothetical reintroduction, a strong majority also preferred life without parole over a death penalty. The reasons cited supporting reintroduction also fail to concur with the facts: “deterrence” (58%)and “saving money” (57%) – yet in decades of study, the death penalty has not been proven to have any deterrent value greater than a prison sentence and in practice the death penalty has been found to be grossly more costly then even life without the possibility of parole. 
	The true face of the death penalty is exposed in the annual report from Amnesty International.

What I did not anticipate though, was finding out that a neighbour would be facing the death penalty. 
,  
	As far as I know, I never met Hamid Ghassemi-Shall – but I never shopped for shoes in The Beach. The Beach is one of the most popular regions of the city though – little boutiques make it one of those places everyone walks their dog, pushes strollers, enjoys the sun on a patio and runs into old friends. Hamid could pass you on the street today and you would probably not think anything unusual. If you had gone into his shop you would have found a guy with a broad smile offering to help you find a pair of shoes. 
,  
	Like many of us, Hamid came to Canada from another country. He met and fell in love with Antonella Mega. They have a house just a few blocks from where I live. But when I say they, one half is missing. Hamid has not been home with his wife for nearly five years. Instead Hamid has faced the horror of a politically set-up death sentence. A Canadian, a neighbour, facing execution on trumped-up charges. 
,  
	Whether you are for or against the death penalty, if you are Canadian, Hamid’s story must strike a chord. Hamid is a Canadian citizen who worked in a small business. His elderly mother had health issues. Like any dutiful son he visited his mum when she was sick. In Hamid’s case, that meant traveling to Iran, where he was born. While on that visit to his mother, his brother was arrested and charged with ‘espionage.’ The Iranian government couldn’t charge espionage without someone to send information to – so they picked-up Hamid and his own horror began. 
,  
,  
Iran’s record on human rights abuse is extensive. Amnesty International’s annual 2012 report on human rights found that in Iran political suspects were “frequently convicted, sometimes in the absence of defence lawyers, on the basis of ‘confessions’ or other information allegedly obtained under torture during pre-trial detention. Courts accepted such ‘confessions’ as evidence without investigating how they were obtained.”  At trial Hamid was convicted on the basis of an “email exchange” – the evidence of which was tested and analysed by his lawyer and shown to be a complete fabrication. In January 2010 Hamid’s brother died in prison, reportedly of stomach cancer. Despite reviews by Iranian courts Hamid`s death sentence has not been lifted. His life is quite literally at risk of being taken by a regime known for secret executions (and public executions), the execution of minors and of countless political opponents. 
,  
, 	Not long after Hamid’s conviction I met Antonella, his very brave wife. Antonella gets limited communications from her husband. As you can imagine, an Iranian prison is not a place where phones are provided to each “guest” – it is a hard place where torture and deaths in custody are routine and a country which is second only to China in the total number of executions in recent years. 
,  
,  
Amnesty International has just released our Annual Report on the death penalty. The new report covers statistics and important developments over 2012. The Statistics from 2012 on Iran are not good. There were at least 314 officially recognised executions in Iran in 2012 – of which 71% were for ‘drugs offences’ (which like political crimes, are not lethal crimes and outside of international law in terms of crimes that may be capital. 
,  
	The continued existence of the death penalty is what enables regimes like that in Iran to literally exterminate political opposition and to keep citizens in fear for their lives from the government. Execution of a human being is not an authority anyone should have – whether individual or the state. This is why international efforts to abolish the death penalty are so important. 
,  
,  
Canada has fallen surprisingly short on such efforts since 2006. When the United Nations General Assembly first held a call for a universal moratorium on executions with a view to abolition, Canada was widely expected to not only vote in favour, but to join all other long-term abolitionist countries in co-sponsoring the document before the vote. In 2012, the fourth of these calls was made. Again Canada, while voting in favour, refused to co-sponsor. An important gesture of support that costs nothing for the Canadian government to endorse. 
,  
	A recent Angus-Reid opinion survey of Canadian opinion on the death penalty reveals that many hold conflicting opinions of capital punishment and the majority hold beliefs that are not supported by the facts. While a majority appeared to support hypothetical reintroduction, a strong majority also preferred life without parole over a death penalty. The reasons cited supporting reintroduction also fail to concur with the facts: “deterrence” (58%)and “saving money” (57%) – yet in decades of study, the death penalty has not been proven to have any deterrent value greater than a prison sentence and in practice the death penalty has been found to be grossly more costly then even life without the possibility of parole. 
,  
	The true face of the death penalty is exposed in the annual report from Amnesty International.

Amnesty’s Egypt researcher Diana Eltahawy blogs from Cairo 
On Sunday I attended the Cairo funeral of four Coptic Christians killed on Friday night in Khousous, a small town north of the city. 
	I had been planning to travel to Khousous to find out more about the sectarian violence which led to the deaths there. 
	Instead, I found myself caught up in more violence at the funeral itself — with mourners on one side, and unknown assailants and, later, security forces on the other. 
	Before the clashes erupted, feelings of grief, anger and injustice were palpable inside Saint Mark’s Cathedral in Cairo, which was filled with mourners. Tears, prayers and wailing were drowned out by chants against the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, and vows to avenge the dead. 
	Shortly after the caskets and funeral procession made their way out of the cathedral, violence broke out nearby between some of the mourners and assailants reported to be residents of the area. 
	The small number of security forces present when I entered the cathedral about two hours earlier were no longer to be seen. 
	Confusion reigned inside the cathedral, with hundreds of people including priests, the elderly and children in attendance. A rumour spread about a mourner killed outside, increasing tensions further. 
	Attempts to restore calm and halt the violence were not heeded by some of the youth, as stones and fireworks kept flying just outside the main entrance. 
	The violence was temporarily contained as riot police arrived at the main entrance of the cathedral. But the situation quickly degenerated as some of the mourners, exasperated with what they saw as the failure of the authorities to protect them, started throwing rocks at the security forces. 
	Security forces responded with heavy teargas, which filled the cathedral grounds, nearly creating a stampede inside with mourners fleeing deeper into the cathedral compound to seek shelter. 
	When the teargas settled a bit, I exited through the back door of the cathedral. Some mourners chose to stay, saying that they wanted to protect the cathedral from further attacks. Violence re-erupted again later in the day. 
	The latest media reports quoting Ministry of Health officials have said two people died and at least 89 were injured in the violence. A journalist from the Shorouq online portal  is among the injured. 
	The authorities condemned the violence in Khousous and at the cathedral – a welcome step, but not nearly enough. Time and time again, the Egyptian authorities have failed to protect Coptic Christians from sectarian violence and favoured “reconciliation” over prosecution of offenders. 
	For decades the Egyptian authorities have repeatedly failed to protect Coptic Christians and churches from attack. 
	Under Hosni Mubarak, at least 15 major attacks on Copts were documented, and the situation didn’t improve under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces which ruled the country between the downfall of Hosni Mubarak and the election of President Mohamed Morsi. 
	In 2013, under Mohamed Morsi’s rule, Coptic Christian activists reported at least six attacks on Churches or affiliated buildings, in the Governorates of Aswan, Beni Suef, Cairo, and Fayoum. To date, despite promises from President Morsi, no adequate investigations have been conducted, no measures put in place to avoid further violence, and nobody has been punished. 
	This pattern of inaction contributes to the sense of injustice, discrimination and vulnerability felt by Christians in Egypt, and leads perpetrators to believe that they can carry on attacking Christians and get away with it. 
	These failures also violate Egypt’s obligations under international human rights law to effectively protect members of minorities from abuses, and to bring perpetrators to justice. 
	There are numerous versions about what sparked the tragic sectarian violence in Khousous, which led to the deaths of four local Christians and one Muslim by gunshots. 
	The only way to avoid repetition of similar violence is to ensure that investigations into the violence in Khousous and the Saint Mark’s Cathedral are prompt, thorough, independent and impartial and that those responsible, regardless of their faith and affiliation, are brought to justice. The mere promise by Mohamed Morsi of an investigation will not be enough and Egyptians will be looking to see whether he upholds this promise unlike his earlier one to appoint a Coptic vice-president. 
	The authorities must recognize that ignoring this latest round of violence will only give rise to more anger and polarization among the religious communities in Egypt. 
	When some mourners brought in a member of the riot police inside the cathedral grounds, others intervened to protect him shouting that he must not be ill-treated regardless of whether he was a Christian or a Muslim. 
	Voices like these risk becoming silenced, if the authorities fail yet again to protect religious minorities from violence.

At that time Mr. Yoon very clearly indicated that he did not want Amnesty International to take up or campaign on his case.  Amnesty International respects the wishes of prisoners with respect to what action they do or do not want the organization to take on their behalf.  As a result we have not campaigned on Mr. Yoon’s case in any way. 
Amnesty International has since confirmed that Mr. Yoon was brought to trial on terrorism-related charges in the summer of 2012 and sentenced to a two year prison sentence, beginning from the time of his arrest in December 2011.  As such he should be slated for release in December 2013. 
While Amnesty International has not taken action on Mr. Yoon’s case the organization has reported and campaigned extensively with respect to serious human rights concerns related to arrests and trials of individuals on counter-terrorism charges in Mauritania, including that many such arrests are arbitrary, trials do not meet international fair trial standards, and torture and ill-treatment is commonplace.

Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird’s current trip through the Middle East offers a tremendous opportunity to press a strong message that increased respect for human rights – by all governments and by all parties to the region’s various conflicts – provides the road map for lasting peace and security. It is also an opportunity to restore Canada’s standing in the region as a determined champion of human rights; a reputation that has been considerably strained in recent years.  
Canada has staked out a clear human rights position in the Middle East, marked by unflinching reticence to criticize the Israeli government.  Along the way Canada has come to be seen as intensely partisan and even polarizing.  This is the Minister’s chance to demonstrate that the only side that Canada will take in the Middle East is the side of human rights.  
In Jordan that includes the immense difficulties the country faces coping with a flood of Syrian refugees.  There are mounting concerns that the Jordanians have been turning away Palestinian refugees coming from Syria.  Canada’s announcement over the weekend that it will provide increased aid to Jordan to assist in easing the burden was very welcome.  
In the United Arab Emirates an ongoing trial of 94 prisoners on state security charges has been marked by concerns about torture and unfair proceedings; part of an increasingly repressive campaign in the country that has targeted Islamists, liberals, activists, and scholars. 
In Qatar the arrest of two human rights activists who were among signatories to a letter protesting France’s intervention in Mali, has sent a chilling message.  The government has also been slow to embrace reforms to tackle human trafficking and forced labour of migrant workers, looking down the road to the 2022 World Cup. 
Bahrain has faced a full blown human rights crisis.  Hundreds of thousands took to the streets and to social media in 2011, inspired by the peaceful protest movements in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere.  The Bahraini government’s crackdown was harsh and swift.  Two years later prisoners of conscience remain behind bars and activists continue to be jailed. 
While in Bahrain it is crucial that the Minister takes up the case of Canadian citizen Naser al-Raas who was imprisoned and badly tortured for a month in 2011.  Naser al-Raas is back in Canada; but there has been no justice for what he endured.  There has been no effort to identify the individuals responsible for his torture.  Canada should demand a full investigations leading to accountability and redress for Mr. al-Raas. 
In Cyprus there is growing alarm about the country’s approach to refugees and migrants, who are often detained for months and years in abysmal conditions.  Many are held even after court orders that they be released.  
It is of course during the Minister’s visits to Israel and the West Bank that his words about human rights will be most closely scrutinized.  It is so essential that this time there be a strong message to the Israeli government that Canada, which has consistently demonstrated it is a close friend and ally, expects real change when it comes to respect for the rights of Palestinians. 
And there is nowhere better to start than underscoring the necessity for justice, truth and reparation for past human rights violations, including war crimes, committed by both parties.  The years of impunity, be it for war crimes during the 2006 South Lebanon War, the 2008/2009 Gaza War or, most recently, the eight-day military escalation in Gaza and southern Israel in November 2012, build on each other. 
When there are no consequences for the rockets fired into Israel by Palestinian militants, the rockets continue.  But equally true, when there is no accountability for war crimes committed by Israeli forces, documented by numerous international experts and organizations, those violations repeat.  Canada can and should press the Israeli government and Palestinian officials to commit to a justice agenda. 
Insecurity and instability in the Middle East is rooted in deeply-rooted disregard for human rights.  At every stop, and to all governments, the Minister should lead with the expectation that human rights must now come first.

Once upon a time, treaty negotiations literally took place behind closed doors. Unless you had some good friends among the delegates, you had to wait until the very end to know the results.  Much of this month’s Arms Trade Treaty negotiations have not been covered by the media. But in the internet age I could virtually be there monitoring Amnesty delegates’ Twitter accounts while tuning into the live feed from the United Nations. 
After two decades of work to develop a treaty, the procedural delays around just getting the delegations into the room were nerve-racking. Would we or would we not finally have an Arms Trade Treaty?  Hurry up and vote! Once things got underway, however, it wasn’t long before Iran, Syria and North Korea blocked the consensus needed to finalize the treaty.  Though several states argued for adoption anyway, UN procedure means a return to another venue on another day, most likely the General Assembly itself. 
Why was I so anxious to see a result today? Because the world really can’t wait any longer.  We desperately need effective global regulation. Without it, the human cost is simply too high.  Every minute at least one person loses their life because of the poorly regulated arms trade. Every year, half a million people die from armed violence. Millions more are injured, brutally repressed, raped or forced to flee from their homes as a result of abuses and atrocities committed with conventional arms and ammunition. 
Each time I met with a Member of Parliament over the past year, they asked me what an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) would do. Will it prevent another Syria? Another Congo? How will it save lives? 
In the words of my AI Mexico colleague Irma Pérez Gil “This treaty, like all treaties, is not a magic formula but if it is strong it will create a safer world.” 
A single treaty can’t be expected to end all wars – the factors involved in preventing and reducing conflict are many. What an ATT can do is help protect civilians by keeping weapons out of the hands of forces likely to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. But this isn’t just about international or internal armed conflicts. 
Effective arms control also means that states that routinely crackdown on peaceful demonstrations will find themselves without rubber bullets, tear gas and other security equipment to deploy. Armed groups and organized criminal elements hoping to take advantage of illegal trades or diversion of poorly stored weapons will find their supplies drying up. Brokers working outside the law will be out of business.  
Even states not signing on to an ATT will nonetheless be well aware of what the new rules are for the arms trade. A treaty becomes a powerful tool for diplomacy. 
By stigmatizing and taking away some of the means to commit violations and create insecurity, space can be opened up to get out of a “conflict mentality” in which the only resolution is escalation until one side or the other is defeated and/or popular movements for reform are brutally crushed. 
After two unsuccessful treaty conferences in less than a year, can the ATT be salvaged? Should it? The answer is a resounding yes. Each round of negotiations has produced a more comprehensive text and brought more states on board, including key players such as the United States – by far the biggest arms dealer in the world. We must keep fighting for the creation of a strong global standard to rein in irresponsible arms trades. 
Listen to the words of Marren Akatsa-Bukach, the Executive Director of the Eastern African sub Regional Support Initiative for Advancement of Women, an organization working with survivors of violence: “We really need to control the flow of arms. In Africa, we don’t even know where the arms come from. We really need to prevent countries where there’s real potential of sexual violence from accessing small arms. You don’t need a hundred guns to abuse women’s rights. One man with a gun can rape a whole village.” 
Imagine a world in which AK-47s are no longer put in the hands of child soldiers, refugee camps can enjoy genuine security, activists can raise their voices, and journalists can tell their stories without fear of losing their lives. We can and will make that a reality. 
Amnesty’s campaign for the Arms Trade Treaty is far from over.

Armed groups and organized criminal elements hoping to take advantage of illegal trades or diversion of poorly stored weapons will find their supplies drying up. Brokers working outside the law will be out of business.  
,  
Even states not signing on to an ATT will nonetheless be well aware of what the new rules are for the arms trade. A treaty becomes a powerful tool for diplomacy. 
,  
By stigmatizing and taking away some of the means to commit violations and create insecurity, space can be opened up to get out of a “conflict mentality” in which the only resolution is escalation until one side or the other is defeated and/or popular movements for reform are brutally crushed. 
,  
After two unsuccessful treaty conferences in less than a year, can the ATT be salvaged? Should it? The answer is a resounding yes. Each round of negotiations has produced a more comprehensive text and brought more states on board, including key players such as the United States – by far the biggest arms dealer in the world. We must keep fighting for the creation of a strong global standard to rein in irresponsible arms trades. 
,  
Listen to the words of Marren Akatsa-Bukach, the Executive Director of the Eastern African sub Regional Support Initiative for Advancement of Women, an organization working with survivors of violence: “We really need to control the flow of arms. In Africa, we don’t even know where the arms come from. We really need to prevent countries where there’s real potential of sexual violence from accessing small arms. You don’t need a hundred guns to abuse women’s rights. One man with a gun can rape a whole village.” 
,  
Imagine a world in which AK-47s are no longer put in the hands of child soldiers, refugee camps can enjoy genuine security, activists can raise their voices, and journalists can tell their stories without fear of losing their lives. We can and will make that a reality.

Mtetwa was arrested on Sunday 17 March when she responded to a client whose home was being searched by police in Harare. She remained in custody despite a High Court order for her immediate release being issued at around 1am Monday morning. 
“Beatrice Mtetwa is the unfortunate victim of arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention and must be released immediately,” said Noel Kututwa, Amnesty International’s southern Africa director. 
“It’s staggering that while Zimbabwe is in the process of adopting a new constitution which provides a stronger bill of human rights, lawyers in the course of their lawful duty are being so blatantly harassed and intimidated.” 
Beatrice Mtetwa responded to the call of a client, Thabani Mpofu, who is a staff member in Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s office, on Sunday morning during a police search of his home. When she arrived at the premises police were already conducting the search. 
She asked to be shown the search warrant and when police failed to produce it she told police that what they were doing was “unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and undemocratic”.  Police arbitrarily arrested her accusing her of shouting and “obstructing the course of justice”. Ms Mtetwa was handcuffed and detained in a police vehicle. 
Following her arrest, Beatrice Mtetwa’s lawyers obtained a High Court order for her immediate release on the grounds that the arrest was unlawful. Police did not comply with the order and she remained in police custody. During the night, two male police officers entered her cell and attempted to remove her blankets. 
On Tuesday 19 March Beatrice Mtetwa was brought to the Magistrate’s Court in Harare and she applied for bail.  At the hearing Ms Mtetwa’s lawyers reported that she was ill-treated while in custody.  She was denied access to her family and was denied a bath while in police custody. 
The bail hearing concluded today with the denial of bail. Beatrice Mtetwa has been remanded in custody until 3 April. 
“Beatrice Mtetwa’s arrest and detention is an attack on the legal profession in Zimbabwe and in particular on lawyers who have fearlessly defended human rights defenders and political activists,” said Kututwa. 
“The Zimbabwean authorities must ensure that lawyers are able to perform all of their professional duties without intimidation, hindrance, harassment and improper interference.” 
Amnesty International has observed an increase in attacks on the rights of freedom of expression, association and assembly in the run up to the just ended referendum and to Zimbabwe’s 2013 general elections.

Even if you didn’t listen to the words, the video images spoke volumes at the hearing on Colombia on March 14, 2013, at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington.  
,  
Maria Patricia Tobón Yagarí, of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC), sat alone but with enormous dignity and strength of purpose as she spoke out about the ongoing violence and denial of human rights which threaten the very survival of Indigenous peoples in Colombia. 
,  
The situation is so desperate that an increasing number of suicides by Indigenous women are being reported, testified Ms. Tobón, underscoring the risks posed by a lethal mix of armed conflict and the imposition of resource extraction on Indigenous lands. 
,  
On the other side of the room was a phalanx of government officials, representing different ministries of the South American country that is now Canada’s free trade partner. Each official repeated eloquent commitments to the human rights of Indigenous peoples. Yet the Colombian government, despite public promises and all the resources of the state, has so far failed to implement the safeguards ordered by its own highest court in order to protect endangered Indigenous peoples. 
,  
 
,  
In 2009, the Constitutional Court of Colombia issued a landmark ruling, identifying 34 Indigenous peoples at risk of physical and cultural extermination amidst the devastating consequences of armed conflict and forced displacement from resource-rich territory. It called for action without delay to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. Yet Indigenous peoples remain under attack and without protection of their rights. 
,  
Ms Tobón appealed, amongst other measures, for an international verification mission and for the suspension of mining and exploration activities in Indigenous territory, echoing an unprecedented court order in Chocó earlier this year to protect the rights of Embera Katío inhabitants of Alto Andágueda. 
,  
Pressure from Canada, in support of the rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, would make a significant difference, particularly given the special relationship our government has with Colombia’s government. 
,  
The government of Stephen Harper has invested enormous energy over the past 5 years to achieve a free trade agreement with Colombia, and asserted repeatedly that this would give Canada more influence to press for human rights. 
,  
It is crucial that Canada delivers on that promise, particularly as Canadian companies move in to Colombia to exploit natural resources there. 
,  
We must insist that Canada is part of the solution not the problem. We must show the deep concern of Canadians for the survival of Indigenous peoples in Colombia.  We must demand effective action, without delay!

Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada from Duékoué, Côte d’Ivoire, 2 March 2013 
“Nature is growing back, making it look like nothing ever happened here.” 
Those were the sad words of a tenacious local human rights defender as we drove past the ruins of the Nahibly displaced persons camp just outside the town of Duékoué in western Côte d’Ivoire. 
The Nahibly Camp, which was home to about 5,000 people, was totally destroyed on July 20, 2012, in a massive attack by a mob estimated at 1,000, led by local Dozo militias and including members of the national army (FRCI).  
At least 14 people – almost certainly more – were killed during the attack. Hundreds more were injured.  Many more were rounded up and ‘disappeared’ as they fled the camp.  Six bodies have since been found in a nearby well but many others are still missing. 
We carried out extensive research in the area last September and heard harrowing stories of the ferocity and brutality of the attack. People were killed and injured by guns, machetes, axes, and clubs and by being burned alive. At that time, about eight weeks after the attack, the signs of the violence were still everywhere. Plastic sheeting, torn and burnt, still hung from wooden frames.  
Charred and abandoned clothing and possessions were everywhere. I remember a haunting pair of flip-flops, lying along a pathway, one slightly ahead of the other, as if they had slipped from the feet of someone as they fled. I wondered whether she or he had reached safety; or not. Touring through the site the clamour and terror of the attack still echoed. 
Our local human rights colleague was right, though, five months later it has all faded away. In fact, driving past, if you did not know what had once been there, you would not even take notice.  
The remnants of shelters and tents have been dismantled, likely carted away for firewood and other uses. And this area’s lush vegetation has certainly rebounded. What still looked like a scarred battlefield in September is abundant and green in March. 
But the human rights defender wasn’t really talking about plants and bushes. What he was pointing out was that the very memory of the Nahibly attack is itself fading away. Like so many other serious human rights violations that have devastated the west of the country in recent years: time passes, there is no justice and impunity only deepens and grows over. 
It is the same with respect to massacres in Duékoué’s Carrefour neighbourhood in which as many as 800 people may have been killed at the end of March 2011.  On previous missions to the area we have paid quiet respects at a field which is a mass grave in which many of those killed have been buried.  
In the past there was something raw and solemn about the site. This time it too was a jumble of grass and weeds and strewn with litter. Nothing solemn. No sign or plaque to mark the tragedy. 
We spent time as well in the village of Diahiba, hearing from some of the survivors of a terrible attack here on March 28, 2011- the day before the Duékoué massacre – in which 48 people were killed.  
One woman showed us the recently erected tombs in which her mother and younger brother are buried.  Her aunt’s body is buried nearby. Two years on they still grieve and try to rebuild their lives; but wonder why there is no justice. 
Time passes. Soon after the Nahibly attack, reports emerged, including from a survivor, that people who had been rounded up while fleeing the camp had been summarily executed and disposed of in a number of wells in the area.  
It took two months for families and activists to convince the authorities to investigate one of the wells. Six bodies were recovered. At least three of them – two male and one female – were positively identified by family members on the basis of clothing and jewellery. The badly decomposed bodies were then taken to Abidjan more than 600 kilometres away, for autopsies.  
Four months later the bodies have not been returned and autopsy results have not been shared. 
Meanwhile, one intrepid local activist lowered himself by rope into some of the other nearby wells and was able to determine that there are more bodies to be found. Hard to say how many.  
Out of fear that whoever is responsible for the killings might want to tamper with the wells, quite extraordinarily, a UN military and police contingent has been stationed in the area on a round-the-clock basis the past four months. 
But that is the extent of what has happened. Officials say that they are trying to figure out the best way to excavate the wells and determine what equipment and material is needed. Meanwhile families in the area still clamour for news of their loved ones. 
And time passes. Nature grows over the sites at Nahibly and Carrefour. Corpses deteriorate in the water deep down the well holes. No sign of justice. 
There was ironically much talk about justice while we were in the country because the pre-trial hearings in the case of former president Laurent Gbagbo at the International Criminal Court were wrapping up.  
Of course there should be full accountability for any human rights violations for which his administration – and all parties to the conflict – are responsible.  
Amnesty International documents are replete with the details. But it was striking to hear so much about justice on that side of the conflict and hear and see absolutely nothing on the other side; justice for the violations that forces aligned with the current government have committed. 
All of this plays out against a backdrop of continuing insecurity. It is not just about the past. In the west, tensions remain high particularly in rural areas beyond the main towns and villages. Farmers are too fearful to return to fields in more remote areas; because they face threats and attacks from Dozo militia at barricades and on patrols. 
Illegal, arbitrary arrest and detention continue to be a major problem in Abidjan and elsewhere. And the cases of former associates Laurent Gbagbo – including his wife Simone who we visited in the house where she has been imprisoned in a remote northwestern corner of the country awaiting trial for close to 18 months – languish and do not proceed. Justice is one-sided, yes, but even then it falls far short of international norms. 
In the midst of this we launched a major new Amnesty International report at a well-attended and widely-reported national press conference, stemming from research last fall. The title, “The Victors’ Law,” captures concerns about one-sided justice at what is a critical juncture for Côte d’Ivoire. 
This is the time of reconciliation and rebuilding. But unless the country begins to see accountability for all perpetrators of human rights violations and justice for all victims, insecurity will continue to undermine reconciliation. 
Grass will grow over and well water will wash over the past. But the past will not be forgotten. 
Grieving family members in Diahiba will not forget. Local human rights defenders will not forget. We spoke also with relatives of two of the men whose bodies were recovered from the first well hole. They will not forget. 
And Amnesty will not forget. We will continue to stand with Ivorians in the struggle for justice for all.

He or she can be returned to Mexico within months. 
Mexico was not safe for Miriam López. 
On 2 February 2011, Miriam was detained and tortured by Mexican soldiers. In order to get Miriam to implicate herself and others in drug trafficking offences, the soldiers subjected her to electric shocks and near asphyxiation, then raped her three times. 
Miriam was eventually released without charges. She has been brave enough to file a formal complaint. Yet nobody has been brought to justice. 
Miriam Lopez is not the only one. In the last few years, thousands of Mexicans have reported torture and ill-treatment at the hands of soldiers and police. In the vast majority of cases, those responsible are never held to account. 
For years Amnesty International has described a severe public security crisis in many regions of the country.  During the Calderón administration, at least 60,000 people were killed and more than 160,000 internally displaced.  Much of this violence occurs during inter-cartel territorial disputes, but also as a result of security force operations. Gender-based violence is widespread, with official figures of killings of women rising rapidly in the last three years. Community leaders, journalists and social activists who advocate for human rights have come under attack because of their work highlighting human rights violations.  Impunity for these crimes and others persists, fuelling insecurity. 
In its own reports the Mexican government has estimated that 26,122 people have gone missing since December 2006 
Amnesty International is deeply concerned by Canada’s decision to name Mexico as a safe country.  Mexico hasn’t been a safe country for tens of thousands of people, and no one is being held to account.	How will Canada be held to account if failed refugees are returned to torture, rape or death?

Last May was by no means a high-point for individual Canadians and organizations working to protect human rights domestically and globally.  In fact, many of us hung our heads in embarrassment. 
The UN human rights expert who focuses on food security, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, had just wrapped up a ten day visit to Canada.  It had been a busy visit as he made considerable effort to reach out to and engage with Canadian food security and human rights groups everywhere he went. 
Such visits are a common occurrence.  UN Special Rapporteurs regularly visit countries around the world and offer recommendations for improving human rights protection in their areas of specialty.  There have been similar visits from several other UN experts in past years. And the visits are always at the agreement of the country concerned. 
As he was making final public statements and holding government meetings at the end of his visit the Special Rapporteur, Olivier De Schutter, came under stunning and unprecedented attack from the government.  He was insulted personally, he was blamed for his own government’s opposition to the Canadian seal hunt, and he was ridiculed and derided for having wasted his time in coming to an affluent country like Canada.  It was insulting to the millions of Canadian who face food insecurity.  It was a complete gutting of the meaning of Canada’s universal obligations with respect to economic, social and cultural rights.  And it undermined the integrity of the international human rights system, suggesting that it is appropriate to attack and insult UN human rights experts when in disagreement. 
The government claimed they were upset about the timing of comments Mr. De Schutter had made to the press.  That did not come even remotely close to justifying the personal, inflammatory and legally inaccurate and misleading nature of the government attacks on him. 
Today in Geneva, the report from Olivier De Schutter’s report was officially presented at a session of the UN Human Rights Council.  Following his presentation, the Canadian government, represented by the Ambassador at the Canadian Mission in Geneva, took to the floor to respond. 
Amnesty International and many other Canadian human rights groups hoped that we would hear a more constructive tone.  We listened closely.  While there were no personal insults this time, we were sorely disappointed. 
We heard boasts about Canada being one of the most affluent countries in the world, with numerous programs in place to respond to food insecurity among vulnerable groups such as Indigenous peoples and immigrant communities.   The fact that food security is one of Canada’s five international development assistance priorities was also highlighted. 
The bulk of the presentation, however, focused on criticizing the Special Rapporteur’s work.  He was chastised for his “attempt” to analyze relevant Canadian laws, the suggestion being that he didn’t get that right.  Civil society groups in fact were impressed by his sophisticated and thorough analysis.  He was reprimanded for exceeding his mandate by commenting on such matters as the constitutional status of Indigenous peoples and trade policy.  He was also criticized for widesweeping conclusions about Canadian agricultural policy. 
Most frustrating however was the very pointed rejection of Mr. De Schutter’s concerns about the ways that Canada’s federal structure, and relations between various levels of government, get in the way of strong protection of the right to food.  His concerns reflect the consistent experience of Canadian human rights groups.  It is a concern that has been highlighted several times by the Canadian Senate’s Standing Committee on Human Rights.  And it has been noted with mounting frustration by virtually all of the independent UN expert committees charged with overseeing the UN’s major human rights treaties. 
However today the Canadian government slapped Mr. De Schutter’s wrist for even raising the topic, concluding that he simply didn’t understand the nature of federalism in Canada.  And then to my astonishment the government asserted that Canadian federalism has a “multiplier effect” when it comes to protecting human rights, as there are multiple levels of government involved in delivering the goods. 
That stands completely contrary to the years of deep frustration that Canadian groups across the country have faced in working to protect human rights within a federal Canada.  Rather than multiplying protection, the consistent experience is one of federalism as a source of confusion and inaction; and an excuse for no one level or department within any government in the country to take leadership. 
Perhaps the biggest disappointment – surprising or not – came at the end.  That was the lack of any imaginative or inspirational vision of the way forward.  It was an opportunity for a prosperous country to reaffirm that human rights are truly universal; and that economic, social and cultural rights absolutely must be protected within affluent states.  It was a chance for leadership; in a world that needs ever more human rights leaders, not more human rights detractors. 
It was not to be.  The only vague promise made was to “examine” the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations; nothing more.    Certainly no commitments, not even to take up the very constructive, overarching recommendation to develop a comprehensive, national, rights-based strategy for protection of the right to food in Canada.  And not a word about consulting and engaging with the active and very engaged organizations across Canada who are at the frontline when it comes to responding to food insecurity in Canada. 
Bruce Porter from the Social Rights Advocacy Centre had a 2 minute speaking slot on behalf of Canadian NGO’s.  He made it clear that food insecurity is indeed a very real human rights problem in Canada – for 4 million people.  He reiterated how shocked we were when the government attacked De Schutter last May.  And he expressed our hope that we will still see a more constructive response from the government on this important report about an important human rights concern. 
In his final comments, responding to a question from our NGO group, Olivier De Schutter noted that Canada’s approach to implementing international human rights obligations is “ineffective” and that there is a notable lack of meaningful remedies for violations of economic, social and cultural rights. How true. 
Sadly, the disappointment felt in May 2012 was not lifted by what we heard today.  All the more reason to redouble two important campaigns: stronger protection of the right to food in Canada; and to press Canada to once again become a leader in the crucial effort to strengthen (not undermine) the international human rights system.

The lives of Indigenous women and girls count. These are some well-document facts and figures about violence against Aboriginal women in Canada: 
	According to the most recent study by Statistics Canada, in more than 60 percent of homicides in Canada police never identify whether or not the victim was Aboriginal.	The fact that this information is not being recorded has serious consequences for understanding of violence against Indigenous women and for allocating resources to address this violence. 
Although Amnesty International and Indigenous women’s organizations have been raising this concern for a decade, most police forces in Canada still do not have guidelines or training to ensure that they record this information correctly. As stated in our original 2004 Stolen Sisters report, some police never identify whether or not the victims of violent crime are Aboriginal because they fear that doing so would expose them to allegations of racism or racial profiling. Other police inaccurately identify the victims of violent crime only if the persons “looks Aboriginal” to them. 
The problem of police not consistently or accurately recording the Aboriginal identity of victims of homicide and other violent crimes is not the only problem. As a new report by Human Rights Watch powerfully illustrates, the wide gulf of mistrust and misunderstanding between police and Indigenous communities means that Indigenous women may never come forward to report crimes such as sexual assault and other violence. We also know that the knowledge that child and family service agencies are more likely to take away Indigenous children than non-Indigenous children creates additional reasons for Indigenous women to fear coming forward. 
What we do know with certainty is that Indigenous women and girls face widespread and severe forms of violence, that this violence targets Indigenous women from all walks of life, and that not enough is being done about it. 
The best available data that has been analyzed by Statistics Canada suggests that the homicide rate for Indigenous women in Canada is at least seven times higher than for non-Indigenous women. 
Saskatchewan, which to our knowledge is the only jurisdiction to have conducted a thorough review of all its long-term missing persons files to examine possible patterns of disappearance of Indigenous women, found that 60 percent of missing women were Indigenous, even though at the time Indigenous people made up only 6 percent of the provincial population. 
It’s time for police and governments to act on the information they already have, rather than making excuses for inaction. The lives of Aboriginal women and girls matter. Nothing less than a national action plan is required.

Syrian activist Bassam Ahmed Al-Ahmed recalls his time as a detainee alongside his friend, doctor Ayham Mustafa Ghazoul, whose family was recently informed of his death while in the custody of Syrian security forces in November 2012. Both men were among a group of people detained in a raid on the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression on 16 February 2012. 
What more can I say about Ayham than that he was a human being before anything else? 
What was most striking to me about him was that he was so self-sacrificing and strongly believed that every person should give up what’s most precious to them – their work, their studies, or even a lover or family members – for this revolution. 
He was a very peaceful person who would always say, “Don’t carry a weapon, just go protest and if you die, you die a martyr”. 
When they arrested us last February and brought us to the Air Force Intelligence we were all too scared to get off the bus. 
They called out for Mazen Darwish, the director of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression. 
After he went down they asked for another person to come out and Ayham volunteered. I was shocked, thinking to myself, “How is this possible? How? Is he afraid of nothing?” 
He was very cheerful during our imprisonment, always coming over and lessening our burden. He took on the role of our doctor, caring for us and our wellbeing, diagnosing our illnesses and telling us how to manage them. 
The Fourth Division’s detention centre’s doctor was an idiot, so he would give Ayham medicine to give to heart patients regularly. 
Ayham was subjected to the most abuse and beating in the Fourth Division. 
Firstly it was because he was a doctor and they hated seeing someone more knowledgeable than themselves. Secondly, as he was from Deir ‘Atiyah, the man beating us would say “Deir ‘Atiyeh is the most beautiful area in Syria, why are you protesting?” Ayham would respond saying, “But my charge isn’t demonstrating,” and the man would go back to beating him. 
Among my fellow detainees, he was the one I would talk to most – I would cry and say, “Is it possible that a day will come when we leave this grave?”. 
Ayham would tease me, saying that our fellow detainees Hani [al-Zitani] and Mansour [al-Omari] would leave before me and I would remain in custody for another five months, and I would just cry some more. 
After 33 days of imprisonment in the Fourth Division, and 33 more at the Air Force Intelligence detention centre, the assistant came and called for Ayham Mustafa Ghazoul. Though I was extremely tired, when I heard his name, Ayham, it rang in my ears and gave me hope to be reborn far from here. 
Then they called for [another detainee] Joan Fersso I instantly began packing my clothes, for God had sent my soul a sign: Bassam, they will call you next. 
Sure enough, they did. 
Because of this, when they called out my friend’s name – Ayham Mustafa Ghazoul – it made me feel reborn, and gave me the sense that I was heading towards a new life. 
After his release Ayham Mustafa Ghazoul was rearrested and subsequently died in custody.

	Azza Hilal Suleiman became known internationally last year as the “red-hooded woman”. Video footage* showed her helping another woman whose underwear was exposed as Egyptian soldiers dragged and beat her during a demonstration. Then Azza too was attacked, so viciously that she almost lost her life. 
	I spoke to Azza at her home in Cairo about her life-changing experiences since the Egyptian uprising began. 
	This vibrant 49-year-old woman was brought up in a military family – her father, two uncles and two brothers are all army generals. She led a pretty conventional life until the “25 January Revolution” turned her life upside-down.   
	“I was so innocent,” she said. “I went to the Day of Anger demonstration on 28 January 2011 by bus. I saw the demonstration, so asked the driver to stop. As we walked, our numbers kept growing. I was very happy.” 
	She soon witnessed the security forces using unprecedented violence against protesters, gunning people down and beating them. She was overwhelmed by the fog of tear gas. 
	“But we all had great courage,” she said. “I kept pushing past the riot police, who seemed smaller than me. I tried to save a young boy carrying his shopping who had been grabbed by the riot police.” 
	The fearlessness and anger she felt that day has never left her. 
	She joined another protest on 17 December 2011, near Cairo’s Cabinet Offices. That’s when she saw troops assaulting the young woman, exposing her underwear. She threw herself over the woman to protect her. Then, she too was attacked by soldiers, and her ruthless beating was captured	on video. 
	The next thing Azza remembers is waking up in hospital. She had a fractured skull and her swollen face left her barely recognizable. She had been in a coma for a week and doctors told her family to prepare for the worst. 
	“At the beginning, the pain was so bad that I would wake up screaming, and I fainted a lot. But lots of friends and relatives helped me.” 
	One of those friends was a man who soon became her fiancé. “He really supported me, and we held the same views on the revolution and justice,” she smiled, “so I melted with love for him.” 
	On 2 May 2012 he was shot dead at a sit-in at the Ministry of Defence in Abbaseya, Cairo, by “thugs” she says the army used “to do its dirty work”. “It was this that made me take up the battle for justice for the many crimes committed by the military,” she said, “much more than my own case”. 
	She submitted a complaint about her assault to the public prosecution, but nothing happened. She is determined to get justice, and vows to take her case before international bodies if necessary. 
	Like other women activists I interviewed in Cairo, Azza was far more interested in talking about getting justice for others, rather than for herself. She wants justice for the Coptic Christians killed in Cairo, on 9 October 2011. And for all those killed and injured during the uprising – and since then. 
	Does she remain optimistic, I asked. “Of course,” she said. “It was depressing before the revolution. There was so much injustice and so many things imposed on you. I used to despair and think there was no escape. Now I am full of hope.” 
	Her words still resonate: “Don’t give up on your rights. You only have rights if you fight for them. And the more we support each other, the stronger we are and the more we will achieve.” 
	Throughout 2013& 2014, Amnesty International supporters around the world took action in support of Azza, urging justice. Azza thanks Amnesty members for their solidarity and work on her case.

Amnesty International members across Canada have responded enthusiastically to the call to “Have a Heart” for First Nations children. 
“Have a Heart” is an annual campaign organized by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada that takes place on and around Valentine’s Day, February 14th. 
The campaign’s message is simple: First Nations children have the right grow up safely at home, get a good education, be healthy, and be proud of their cultures. And getting involved can be as easy as sending a card or letter with this message to the Prime Minister or your Member of Parliament. 
Amnesty members across Canada are already writing letters, on their own, with family and friends, and in larger public events. 
In the Toronto area alone, 11 Amnesty International community and campus groups are getting together to hold letter-writing events. This includes a public event at the Amnesty International office in Toronto on February 13th organized by the Action Network on Women’s Human Rights. 
Amnesty International is encouraging all its members, supporters and allies to take part in this important action. 
Independent studies, including reports by the Auditor General of Canada, have confirmed that government support for crucial services in First Nations communities is simply not adequate to meet basic needs. For example, funding allocated in the critical area of family services is more than 20 percent lower on a per child basis for families on reserves. 
Government officials often talk about the money being spent on services on First Nations but lack the political will needed to ensure that this funding is equitable and meeting the real needs of First Nations children and families. 
That’s why it’s so important that Canadians from all walks of life taking this opportunity to express their support for the clear and simple message at the heart of this action.

Almost every girl and woman – regardless of age, social status or choice of attire – who has walked the streets or taken public transport in Cairo, has experienced some form of verbal or physical sexual harassment. 
This isn’t new. For years, Egyptian women’s rights activists and others have called on the authorities to recognize the seriousness of the problem. 
There needs to be a fundamental shift in institutionalized attitudes that discriminate against women. 
The Egyptian authorities must introduce legal reforms, prosecute perpetrators and address root causes, because the plight of women who have experienced sexual violence has been ignored. 
Blame is placed on the victims for being dressed “indecently”, or for daring to be present in “male” public spaces. 
The horrific testimonies emerging following protests commemorating the second anniversary of the “25 January Revolution” have brought to light how violent mob sexual attacks against women have happened, but have rarely been brought to public attention. 
Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault (OpAntiSH) is an initiative by a number of Egyptian human rights organizations and individuals set up to combat sexual harassment of women in the vicinity of Tahrir Square. It received reports of 19 cases of violent attacks against women on 25 January 2013. 
Activists leading the group “I saw Harassment” told Amnesty International that they managed to intervene in a further five cases before violence escalated. Four women were assaulted inside the Sadat Metro Station and one behind the Omar Maqram Mosque. 
Testimonies from victims and those attempting to save them paint a frightening picture: tens if not hundreds of men surrounding the victims with countless hands tearing-off clothes and veils, unzipping trousers and groping breasts, nipples and backsides. 
In some cases these attacks meet the definition of rape, including penetration with fingers and sharp objects. Frequently, fights with knives, metal rods and sticks breakout amid scenes of chaos, where the lines between those trying to help and those participating in the violent attack become blurred. 
Activists co-ordinating rescue efforts are often exposed to physical and sexual assaults. One from the “I saw Harassment” initiative told Amnesty International that upon receiving a report of an alleged ongoing attack, she rushed to the scene with another female activist. 
She describes what happened: “I ran inside the circle of men to try to save her; the men let me through. Once I was in the middle of the circle, I realized that the person being attacked was my colleague and that the reported attack was a ruse to get us to the scene to intimidate and assault us… Suddenly hands were on my breasts, inside my bra, and squeezing my nipples… I was trying to defend myself and heard my colleague screaming. Her chest was bare and they cut her bra down the middle… In the middle of this, they were insulting us and calling us whores who were asking for this by squeezing ourselves in the middle of men… At some point I could feel 15 hands on me… Someone grabbed me by my clothes and was dragging me on the ground… Another guy put his hand down my trousers.” 
The incident took place in Tahrir Square at about 8:30pm on 23 November 2012, during protests against President’s Mohamed Morsi’s Constitutional Declaration. 
Fortunately, other protesters managed to get the two to safety in a nearby field hospital. They brought one of the attackers they had caught to a police station and eventually the Qasr al-Nil Public Prosecution office. 
The woman activist recounted that police officers and the prosecutor handling the case pressured her to drop her complaint, and only reluctantly agreed to file a report when she insisted with the help of her lawyers. 
This type of response is typical and reflects a culture of denial, inaction and in some cases complicity by law enforcement officials who not only fail to protect women from sexual harassment and assaults, but also fail to properly investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice. As perpetrators get off scot-free,  violent attacks continue as seen on 25 January 2013. 
One survivor of a violent assault on 25 January in Tahrir Square, a volunteer with OpAntiSH, broke the wall of silence and shame surrounding such attacks publishing her testimony on Facebook. 
Her heart-wrenching account was very similar to the one above. 
As she and a female friend rushed to intervene in a reported sexual assault on a woman, they were attacked. 
She described numerous hands ripping her clothes, touching her all over her body including her breasts and backside, and reaching inside her trousers. They eventually managed to escape into a restaurant. 
What is particularly shocking is that these mob sexual assaults are happening in public spaces, sometimes in broad daylight, with thousands of onlookers who do either do nothing, feel helpless, or try to help – exposing themselves to violence. 
I was in the vicinity of Tahrir Square between 6pm and 10pm on 25 January, the time when most of these attacks were happening. 
It was a surreal landscape, moving between the strange normality of people drinking tea and joking in cafes around the Square and the field hospital shrouded in a cloud of teargas near the site of violent confrontations behind Omar Maqram Mosque. 
One protester called warning me not to approach Talaat Harb Street as he had just witnessed two women being surrounded by a vicious mob. I asked some of the doctors in the Square if they received cases of survivors of sexual assaults. They denied it, such cases claiming the reports were exaggerated. 
Now the tear gas has dissipated and the brave women have spoken out, it is clear that they were wrong. 
Activists involved in addressing the phenomenon provide various explanations for its occurrence: a culture of impunity when it comes to violence against women; opportunism by criminal elements in the current climate of political instability; systematic attempts to exclude women from public spaces and deny them their right to participate in the events shaping Egypt’s future and the lack of interest of political movements, officials and in the media. 
The authorities announced a new sexual-harassment law in October, but never implemented it. It does not seem to have been a priority for the authorities. Instead, a new constitution passed in December refers to women’s role as homemakers, and does not explicitly ban discrimination against them. 
Despite the violence, Egyptian women resiliently continue in their participation in protests. 
Regardless of the reasons, it is high time for the Egyptian authorities address sexual harassment and violence against women as well as the chronic and systematic discrimination women in Egypt face every single day of their lives.

Fortunately, other protesters managed to get the two to safety in a nearby field hospital. They brought one of the attackers they had caught to a police station and eventually the Qasr al-Nil Public Prosecution office. 
,  
The woman activist recounted that police officers and the prosecutor handling the case pressured her to drop her complaint, and only reluctantly agreed to file a report when she insisted with the help of her lawyers. 
,  
This type of response is typical and reflects a culture of denial, inaction and in some cases complicity by law enforcement officials who not only fail to protect women from sexual harassment and assaults, but also fail to properly investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice. As perpetrators get off scot-free,  violent attacks continue as seen on 25 January 2013. 
,  
One survivor of a violent assault on 25 January in Tahrir Square, a volunteer with OpAntiSH, broke the wall of silence and shame surrounding such attacks publishing her testimony on Facebook. 
,  
Her heart-wrenching account was very similar to the one above. 
,  
As she and a female friend rushed to intervene in a reported sexual assault on a woman, they were attacked. 
,  
She described numerous hands ripping her clothes, touching her all over her body including her breasts and backside, and reaching inside her trousers. They eventually managed to escape into a restaurant. 
,  
What is particularly shocking is that these mob sexual assaults are happening in public spaces, sometimes in broad daylight, with thousands of onlookers who do either do nothing, feel helpless, or try to help – exposing themselves to violence. 
,  
I was in the vicinity of Tahrir Square between 6pm and 10pm on 25 January, the time when most of these attacks were happening. 
,  
It was a surreal landscape, moving between the strange normality of people drinking tea and joking in cafes around the Square and the field hospital shrouded in a cloud of teargas near the site of violent confrontations behind Omar Maqram Mosque. 
,  
One protester called warning me not to approach Talaat Harb Street as he had just witnessed two women being surrounded by a vicious mob. I asked some of the doctors in the Square if they received cases of survivors of sexual assaults. They denied it, such cases claiming the reports were exaggerated. 
,  
Now the tear gas has dissipated and the brave women have spoken out, it is clear that they were wrong. 
,  
Activists involved in addressing the phenomenon provide various explanations for its occurrence: a culture of impunity when it comes to violence against women; opportunism by criminal elements in the current climate of political instability; systematic attempts to exclude women from public spaces and deny them their right to participate in the events shaping Egypt’s future and the lack of interest of political movements, officials and in the media. 
,  
The authorities announced a new sexual-harassment law in October, but never implemented it. It does not seem to have been a priority for the authorities. Instead, a new constitution passed in December refers to women’s role as homemakers, and does not explicitly ban discrimination against them. 
,  
Despite the violence, Egyptian women resiliently continue in their participation in protests. 
,  
Regardless of the reasons, it is high time for the Egyptian authorities address sexual harassment and violence against women as well as the chronic and systematic discrimination women in Egypt face every single day of their lives.

Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada’s Campaigner for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples will be making a presentation on February 1, the final day of these hearings. 
Amnesty International takes no position either for or against oil and gas development, mining, logging and other resource development per se. However, we do call for the rigorous protection of international human rights standards in every phase of the decision-making process. Meeting these standards means that some projects must be substantially amended or rejected altogether. 
International human rights standards require governments to protect the right of Indigenous peoples to use and benefit from their traditional lands, and to be full and effective participants in all decisions affecting those lands. When it comes to projects that could have a significant impact on those lands, the standard of protection that is required is that of free, prior and informed consent. 
In the case of the the Northern Gateway project, such consent clearly does not exist. The majority of First Nations whose traditional lands would be crossed by the pipeline have opposed the project, as have First Nations who depend on the downstream rivers and coastal waters. Amnesty International has previously said that a project of this magnitude should not go ahead without the consent of the affected Indigenous peoples. 
Canada has made a clear and explicit commitment to uphold international human rights standards. 
International standards for the rights of Indigenous peoples are set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and in a large and consistent body of interpretation by expert international human rights bodies. In Amnesty International’s view, these standards are consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation of the Constitutional protection of Aboriginal and Treaty rights and help clarify and strengthen these domestic legal standards. 
This public hearings into the proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline are wrapping up at a crucial moment in public debate. 
The Northern Gateway Project is one of approximately 600 major resource projects proposed to be developed over the next decade. Last year, the federal government rewrote key environmental protection laws to “streamline” the approvals process, making it less likely that these projects would be subject to full scale public environmental impact assessments. 
These changes, made without consultation with Indigenous peoples — whose lands are at the centre of much of the planned development — helped ignite unprecedented nationwide protests under the banner of the Idle No More movement. 
The federal government has said it will not repeal or amend these laws. But the obligation to respect, protect and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples has not gone away. All Canadians should expect their governments to live up to those obligations. We encourage the public to remind government of those obligations at every opportunity.

First Nations children have the right grow up safely at home, get a good education, be healthy, and be proud of their cultures 
It’s an obvious truth but it’s far from being a reality. 
	As the Auditor General of Canada and many others have noted, the Federal government provides less funding per child for many services for First Nations children on reserves than the Provinces provide for children in their jurisdictions. This is despite often higher costs of delivering such services in small and remote communities, and the greater need experienced by many First Nations communities. 
	The result of the denial of basic rights that most people in Canada take for granted. 
	The annual Have a Heart Day campaign is about involving ordinary people across Canada in demanding an end to this fundamentally unjust situation. The campaign is led by the First Nations Child and Family Caring, a dynamic non-profit organization led by Dr. Cindy Blackstock which advocates for the rights of First Nations children. The Caring Society says, “Have a Heart Day is about caring Canadians working together to ensure First Nations children have proper services that make them feel proud of who they are.” 
	Amnesty International has worked alongside the Caring Society for years to raise awareness of the ongoing discrimination in the funding and quality of basic government services available to First Nations children. Also in February we will once again standing alongside Dr. Blackstock and the Caring Society as the long awaiting Canadian Human Rights Tribunal hearing into the Society’s discrimination complaint against the Federal government is finally heard. 
	The Caring Society has made joining the Have a Heart Day campaign easy. You can take part by sending a Valentine’s Day card or letter to the Prime Minister and your Member of Parliament, hosting a Valentine’s Day party to raise awareness in your school or community, or by spreading the word through social media like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. 
	Last year, people across Canada celebrated Have a Heart day in all sorts of energizing and creative ways. Southeast Child and Family Services in Manitoba collected over 5000 Valentine’s Day cards to send to Parliament. Students at Carleton University held a bake sale, and community members in Saskatchewan celebrated with an educational puppet show. 
	Visit the Have a Heart Day website at www.fncaringsociety/have-a-heart for more information, to send an e-Valentine, or to order Have a Heart Valentine’s cards, posters, bookmarks, and buttons! 
	To find the contact details for you Member of Parliament, visit the Parliament of Canada website.

Take action > Send a letter to Prime MInister Harper demanding that the Canadian government commit to upholding its legal and moral obligations to Indigenous peoples. 
Grassroots rallies across Canada under the banner ‘Idle No More’ have put the spotlight on a federal legislative agenda that is trampling the rights of Indigenous peoples set out in  domestic and international law. 
Bill C-45, the omnibus budget bill, introduced changes to the Indian Act, including measures that would make it easier for First Nations to ‘surrender’ their lands, even without the support of the majority of their members. The omnibus bill also further narrowed the scope of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, and numerous related laws, so that resource development projects on the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples will be much less likely to be subject to a rigorous public environmental impact assessment. These changes are on top of dramatic restrictions on environmental assessments already passed in the previous budget bill. 
These are not the only legislative changes that raise concerns. For example, as Amnesty International has previously highlighted, a Senate bill to regulate First Nations water services asserts the power to unilaterally disregard treaty rights. 
These changes in legislation have the potential to profoundly affect the rights and lives of Indigenous peoples. In each case, these legislative changes have been brought forward without adequate or meaningful consultation with Indigenous peoples – and in many case, over their clearly expressed opposition. 
International human rights standards, such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, require that decisions affecting the rights of Indigenous peoples be made only with their full and effective participation. And when the decisions concern the lands and resources of Indigenous peoples, the appropriate standard is generally, if not always, free, prior and informed consent. 
The rushed adoption of new laws affecting the rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples not only violates these international human rights standards, it falls far short of the legal requirements established in Canadian law. 
In Canada, the rights of Indigenous peoples are enshrined in the Constitution and set out in nation to nation Treaties.  The Supreme Court has clearly said that Parliament cannot ignore these rights. There must be “reconciliation” between the power of the state and the prior sovereignty of Indigenous peoples. Laws passed by Parliament must be balanced against the laws, customs and perspectives of Indigenous peoples and “equal weight” must be given to each. Any infringement on Indigenous rights must be strictly justified. The government must deal “honourably” with both the established and the asserted rights of Indigenous peoples. And in every case, in order to uphold the “honour of the Crown”, there must be good faith consultations to ensure that Indigenous peoples’ concerns are at least “substantially addressed.” 
The Idle No More movement is a vital, grassroots response to the blatant disregard for the rights of Indigenous peoples that is being demonstrated by Parliament. Amnesty International members are encouraged to learn more about the movement and to get involved in rallies in their own communities. Many have already done so.

In the midst of the 2012 holiday season, three local Vancouver artists took their talents to the stage in support of International Human Rights Day. On December 6th, at the fabulous Roundhouse Community Centre in Yaletown, Sam Alviar, Tough Lovers, and special guest Vince Vaccaro rocked the Roundhouse to an eager crowd waiting in anticipation for the fantastic show they had been promised over the previous three weeks. 
The bands delivered, and then some. Sam Alviar and company were the first to win over the crowd with their charming performance, by the end of which, they had many people in search of their debut album at the merchandise table (they are currently recording and expecting to have album out by Spring 2013). The quartet featured back-up vocalist and bass-slapper Myles Keoble, lead guitar shredder Adam Baldwin, the relentless and ruthless Jonathan Mitchell on the drums, and the swooning lead vocalist Sam Alviar – with his catchy acoustic guitar riffs and the occasional sweet sounds of his endearing harmonica. By the time the band had finished their thirty minute set which included favourites “Evelyn” and “I Lie Awake” among many others, the bar had been set. 
After the crowd had returned from a quick break to sign petitions, write postcards, and pick up some Amnesty gear, the stage was set for the second act of the night. The audience was immediately blown away by the sound emanating from the musical geniuses of Tough Lovers. The band proved their worth of every vote they received in solidifying their place in the top 20 list of artists from the 2012 Peak Performance Project. With lead singer Jamie Smail’s enthusiastic, dynamic vocal range, Dane Stevens’ slick bass hands, Graham Madden’s ‘madd’ lead guitar skills, and the powerful, pulsating, beat producing machine that is Ryan Stephenson, Tough Lovers’ set “Started With a Spark” that turned into a full blown ball of fire “Before the Sun Set” on their performance for the night; The crowd, once again, had been sold on the talent they had just witnessed before their very eyes. 
By the time the crowd had returned to their seats and settled in following a brief break, it was finally time to introduce our special guest performer. The final act of the night consisted of a mandolin, an acoustic guitar, and non-other than 2010 Peak Performance Project top 3 finalist Vince Vaccaro, who instantly won the crowd over with his soulful, heart-warming, and captivatingly memorable melodies. But for the exception of clapping and cheers of appreciation after each song, the audience remained silent, awe-struck at the sound of Vince’s breathtaking vocals as he performed popular hits such as “Costa Rica” and “Catch a Fire”. His performance of “Brother” was incredibly moving and noteworthy. With the backdrop behind him displaying pictures of hope for human rights, Vince’s voice rang out to the words of the chorus: “when you come to me I promise I won’t lie. I promise I won’t turn you away”. The forty minute set flew by all too quickly for the crowd, who were all enthralled by Vince’s performance. 
Some of the audience had the opportunity to interact with all the artists after the show, who were happy to have a quick chat and sign some autographs. 
	As successful as the evening was on the musical front, it also turned out to be a fantastic night of activism. With the vehicle of music being the driving force behind the event, many friends, family, and members of the greater community gathered to rally around this truly important global day. It was a great way to fuse people’s love for music with their drive to help people around the world emerge from the darkness of human rights abuses. 
Human rights belong to all of us, not only you and me. Through events like RightsRock 2012 and the many others that took place both nationally and internationally in light of human rights day, we have been able to celebrate all the progress we have made on the matter since 1948. However, these events also remind us that there is still a lot of work to do ahead. You can be a part of this very important movement by taking action today. You never know, you could help save a life. 
A big thank you to all of our volunteers and everyone who helped make this event possible. Check out some sweet photos from our event taken by our amazing photographers Stefany Mailhiot and Ludivine Lecat here!

Arriving in Cairo a few days before the constitutional referendum held on Saturday 15 December, I couldn’t remember a more bitterly divided and polarized Egypt. 
During my last visit to the country as part of an Amnesty International delegation to document human rights violations committed during the 18 days of the “25 January Revolution”, there was a palpable sense of unity among protesters despite the suffering and violence. 
Egyptians from all walks of life – women and men, Christians and Muslims, young and old, liberal and Islamist, affluent and poor – stood together against the government and its tactics to crush the uprising. They put aside their political, religious and ideological differences to fight for a common cause, and they were successful.   
Today, these differences have pitted regular Egyptians against each other and led to bloody clashes in the streets which left at least 12 people dead in the last few weeks. Protesters – who just months ago stood side by side to confront the security forces and the army – found each other on opposite sides of violent clashes. 
Against this backdrop of violence and division, millions of Egyptians in 10 governorates took to the polls on Saturday to cast their votes in the first phase of the highly controversial referendum on the country’s new Constitution. 
Fears that recent unrest will spill over and disrupt the voting luckily failed to materialize, although some incidents of violence and other irregularities were reported. Throughout the day, Amnesty International delegates visited about a dozen polling stations in Cairo and Gharbiya governorates – where boredom and (mostly) cordial chatting characterized the proceedings. 
On Saturday, Amnesty International delegates also visited the family of 24 year-old Khaled Taha Abdel Min’im Abou Ziyad, who was fatally injured in the 5- 6 December clashes between supporters and opponents of President Mohamed Morsi in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Khaled travelled to the capital with other supporters of the President from his small village of Miniyat al-Bandara in Gharbiya governorate. His relatives told Amnesty International that he went to defend the President’s legitimacy and the proposed Constitution. He never returned, receiving a gunshot wound to the neck at around 2am on 6 December. He died five days later. 
On 12 December, we were sitting with the brother of freelance journalist al-Husseiny Abu Daif, when he received an urgent call and rushed out. Later that day,the journalist passed away. He had been shot in the head just after 2am on 6 December in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace, where he was documenting the violence from amongst the President’s opponents. According to his friend Mahmoud Abdel Qader, who was standing by his side, al-Husseiny Abu Daif was showing him his footage when he was shot. 
Tragically, while the factions share similar grief over the loss of loved-ones, there is essentially no meaningful dialogue between them. Each side lays blame and accuses the other of inciting the unrest. 
The one thing they seem to agree on is the failure of the security forces to prevent the violence and protect the protesters. It is indeed shocking that security forces stood by, not only when protesters clashed, but also when President Morsi’s supporters detained and beat dozens of people by the Presidential Palace. 
This failure on the part of law enforcement officials only seems to deepen the distrust of victims and relatives of those who died or were killed in protests since the “25 January Revolution”. 
The night before the referendum took place, Amnesty International delegates went to the working class neighbourhood of Imbaba to meet a number of relatives whose loved-ones were killed during the “25 January Revolution”. 
Sayed Ibrahim Abdel Latif, whose son Mohamed, aged 23, was shot dead in protests on 29 January 2011, recounted his relentless struggle for justice, and the pain of seeing those accused of killing his son not only walk free but also be promoted within the ranks of the Ministry of Interior. 
While he is determined to escalate his fight for accountability, other victims’ relatives at the meeting expressed their frustrations with the failure of the courts to bring those responsible to justice. They threatened to take the law into their own hands to exact revenge, since they have been unable to obtain justice. They placed little faith in the proposed Constitution and referendum to address their concerns.

,  
Arriving in Cairo a few days before the constitutional referendum held on Saturday 15 December, I couldn’t remember a more bitterly divided and polarized Egypt. 
,  
During my last visit to the country as part of an Amnesty International delegation to document human rights violations committed during the 18 days of the “25 January Revolution”, there was a palpable sense of unity among protesters despite the suffering and violence. 
,  
Egyptians from all walks of life – women and men, Christians and Muslims, young and old, liberal and Islamist, affluent and poor – stood together against the government and its tactics to crush the uprising. They put aside their political, religious and ideological differences to fight for a common cause, and they were successful.   
,  
Today, these differences have pitted regular Egyptians against each other and led to bloody clashes in the streets which left at least 12 people dead in the last few weeks. Protesters – who just months ago stood side by side to confront the security forces and the army – found each other on opposite sides of violent clashes. 
,  
Against this backdrop of violence and division, millions of Egyptians in 10 governorates took to the polls on Saturday to cast their votes in the first phase of the highly controversial referendum on the country’s new Constitution. 
,  
Fears that recent unrest will spill over and disrupt the voting luckily failed to materialize, although some incidents of violence and other irregularities were reported. Throughout the day, Amnesty International delegates visited about a dozen polling stations in Cairo and Gharbiya governorates – where boredom and (mostly) cordial chatting characterized the proceedings. 
,  
On Saturday, Amnesty International delegates also visited the family of 24 year-old Khaled Taha Abdel Min’im Abou Ziyad, who was fatally injured in the 5- 6 December clashes between supporters and opponents of President Mohamed Morsi in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Khaled travelled to the capital with other supporters of the President from his small village of Miniyat al-Bandara in Gharbiya governorate. His relatives told Amnesty International that he went to defend the President’s legitimacy and the proposed Constitution. He never returned, receiving a gunshot wound to the neck at around 2am on 6 December. He died five days later. 
,  
On 12 December, we were sitting with the brother of freelance journalist al-Husseiny Abu Daif, when he received an urgent call and rushed out. Later that day,the journalist passed away. He had been shot in the head just after 2am on 6 December in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace, where he was documenting the violence from amongst the President’s opponents. According to his friend Mahmoud Abdel Qader, who was standing by his side, al-Husseiny Abu Daif was showing him his footage when he was shot. 
,  
Tragically, while the factions share similar grief over the loss of loved-ones, there is essentially no meaningful dialogue between them. Each side lays blame and accuses the other of inciting the unrest. 
,  
The one thing they seem to agree on is the failure of the security forces to prevent the violence and protect the protesters. It is indeed shocking that security forces stood by, not only when protesters clashed, but also when President Morsi’s supporters detained and beat dozens of people by the Presidential Palace. 
,  
This failure on the part of law enforcement officials only seems to deepen the distrust of victims and relatives of those who died or were killed in protests since the “25 January Revolution”. 
,  
The night before the referendum took place, Amnesty International delegates went to the working class neighbourhood of Imbaba to meet a number of relatives whose loved-ones were killed during the “25 January Revolution”. 
,  
Sayed Ibrahim Abdel Latif, whose son Mohamed, aged 23, was shot dead in protests on 29 January 2011, recounted his relentless struggle for justice, and the pain of seeing those accused of killing his son not only walk free but also be promoted within the ranks of the Ministry of Interior. 
,  
While he is determined to escalate his fight for accountability, other victims’ relatives at the meeting expressed their frustrations with the failure of the courts to bring those responsible to justice. They threatened to take the law into their own hands to exact revenge, since they have been unable to obtain justice. They placed little faith in the proposed Constitution and referendum to address their concerns. 
,  
This absolute loss of confidence in the judiciary to provide redress to victims was echoed by 16 year-old Mahmoud Mohamed al-Sayid, a member of the 6 April movement and an avid participant in most opposition protests for the past 20 months. We got to his home in the working-class neighbourhood of Dar al-Salam, an informal settlement housing about a million Egyptians, after taking a long ride in a tok-tok, a motored tricycle.

When he took office just a few months ago Mohamed Morsi promised to be the president of all Egyptians. 
But hopes that he would take steps to resolve the current situation and give up the wide-ranging powers that triggered this latest crisis have been dashed after a bitter and bloody night of clashes between the president’s opponents and supporters. 
The clashes followed an attack by the president’s supporters – believed to be largely made up of members of the Muslim Brotherhood – on a sit-in staged by his opponents outside the Presidential Palace in Heliopolis. 
Sahar Mohamed Talaat, a Radio France International worker, was attacked by pro-Morsi men in plain clothes who punched and kicked her on the ground and beat her with batons. 
As a result she suffered bruises to the back and chest and potentially a fractured nose. Several female activists were also reportedly beaten or slapped in the clashes. 
Last night we watched as the two groups confronted each other at Roxy square by the palace, separated by a thin buffer zone of riot police. Both sides hurled insults, stones and Molotov cocktails. 
On several occasions, the riot police fired tear gas into the packed crowds, triggering panicked stampedes but doing little to defuse the situation. We also heard the sound of gunshots. 
Later, we visited a field hospital set up in the nearby Evangelical Church. 
In just a couple of hours, a place of worship had been transformed into a working medical support centre, with doctors on hand to provide first aid and emergency treatment to the injured. 
Volunteers were keeping records of those admitted and handing out food and drinks. 
A spokesperson told us they had received 30 cases of injuries, mostly cuts, but also some more serious injuries, including broken bones and wounds caused by shotgun pellets. 
One was trainee reporter Ahmed Abdel Badei, who we met while he was being treated for shotgun wounds to his right eye and face. He told us he had been watching the events from the side of the president’s supporters when he was shot, apparently by the other side. 
We also found Tamer Mourad, a tourist guide who said he had earlier tried to intervene to defuse the situation and stop the clashes. Instead, he found himself caught in the middle of the two groups and was hit by a stone. The cut needed eight stitches. 
It was a scene reportedly played out in several cities across Egypt last night. At the time of writing, five people are understood to have died and about 500 were injured in Cairo according to the Ministry of Health. 
Several offices of the Muslim Brotherhood and Freedom and Justice Party were set on fire in Port Said, Ismailia, Alexandria and other cities. 
It was hard to imagine that only the night before the same streets had seen a peaceful demonstration. 
On Tuesday night we had joined the thousands of protesters as they marched on the Presidential Palace, chanting “peaceful, peaceful” as the riot police withdrew before them. We saw Egyptians of all ages, men, women and children. 
They were calling on the president to give up a new decree which gives him wide-ranging powers, and to reject a draft constitution rushed through the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly, despite the fact that the assembly has been boycotted by many political parties and groups. 
As more protesters entered the surrounding streets, we saw the riot police return to fire tear gas to try and disperse them, before melting away once more, this time abandoning equipment and even an armoured truck as they went. 
Yet despite Tuesday’s massive peaceful protest and last night’s violent unrest, there is no sign that the authorities are prepared to take steps to calm the situation, or to avoid further confrontation. 
Instead, the vice-president has announced they are preparing to press ahead with a constitutional referendum on 15 December, a move likely to increase tensions further. 
Today, the presidential guards’ tanks are back on the streets of Cairo. The army has been deployed outside the presidential palace, an ominous and deeply worrying sign of things to come. Few expected this crisis to be resolved quickly. 
But the authorities have not given any indication that they are willing to budge at all, and, today, the divisions seem more entrenched than ever. 
More anti-Morsi marches were organized today to the Presidential palace in reaction to the events yesterday, while further mobilization is expected on Friday.

0,Canada: Surveillance of Indigenous protests and rule of law,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-canada-surveillance-indigenous-protests-and-rule-law/,Reports published this week in the Toronto Star and on indy media sites reveal that a special RCMP unit was formed in 2007 to produce intelligence updates on potential Indigenous protests “incited by development activity on traditional territory.” The RCMP shared this information with...,"Reports published this week in the Toronto Star and on indy media sites reveal that a special RCMP unit was formed in 2007 to produce intelligence updates on potential Indigenous protests “incited by development activity on traditional territory.” The RCMP shared this information with other police forces, with government and with “industry partners.” 
	Many of the communities under surveillance by the RCMP had been subject of reports by Amnesty International and by United Nations human rights bodies. These include the Lubicon Cree in Alberta and Grassy Narrows and Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug in Ontario. 
	The latest revelations about surveillance of Indigenous activists raises serious concerns about the complicity of police and government in defining legitimate defense of human rights as “threats” requiring a law enforcement response – and the consequence that this has had for the rights and safety of those activists. 
	RCMP scrutiny included protests in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory. In 2007 and 2008 the Ontario Provincial Police deployed hundreds of heavily armed officers, including snipers, in response to road blockades and land occupations. The OPP have never explained how this preparation to use lethal force could be justified or how it was consistent with police policies requiring use of force be kept to the minimum and used only when strictly necessary. 
	Amnesty International’s own research has shown that the OPP response was vastly out of proportion to any demonstrated threat to public safety from the protests themselves. In fact, in one incident, the police decision to arrest selected “protest leaders” by force, rather than simply asking them to turn themselves in for arrest, escalated the situation to the point that police pointed automatic rifles at protesters and bystanders. 
	Amnesty International has repeatedly called for the province to carry out an independent probe into police actions at Tyendinaga to determine what went wrong. The information that Tyendinaga was the subject of RCMP intelligence at the time of these incidents raises additional questions about whether specific information supplied by the RCMP contributed to this dangerous over-reaction, or whether the simple fact of the protests being discussed as a potential threat to security contributed to an unwarranted escalation of the OPP response. 
	The deeper question being asked by Indigenous peoples is why so time and money being spent on keeping tabs on Indigenous activists rather than addressing the violations of Indigenous peoples’ land rights that lead to protest. After all, Indigenous peoples’ rights to the land are also part of the structure of the law, affirmed in Canadian constitutional law and in international human rights treaties and standards. As Ontario’s Ipperwash Inquiry observed, land rights protests arise out of frustration with the ongoing failure of governments in Canada to respect and uphold these legal rights. 
	One of the most notorious cases of land rights violations in Canada is the situation of the Lubicon Cree. United Nations human rights bodies have repeatedly condemned Canada’s failure to protect Lubicon land rights in the face of massive oil and gas development on their land. The federal government has not held any talks with the Lubicon since 2003. We now know however that the RCMP was keeping an eye on the Lubicon and keeping “industry partners” informed.

Community member Judy DaSilva says of the blockade, ‘It was the last thing we could do because everything around us was disappearing. The clean water, the clean air, our way of life, our traditions, like the wild rice picking and even blueberries were disappearing.’ 
The blockade catalyzed one of the most  successful campaigns in recent Canadian history for the recognition and protection of the human rights of Indigenous people rights. But the campaign is not over. 
The logging has stopped, for now. And Grassy Narrows is in high level talks with the province over the future of the forest. But there is still no guarantee that their rights will be upheld. 
The people of Asubpeeschoseewagong Anishinabek (Grassy Narrows First Nation) have shown a steadfast determination to maintain and restore their lands and way of life, often in the face of overwhelming odds. Amnesty International has been proud to stand alongside them through our reports and letter-writing appeals. 
Watch our interview with Judy DaSilva about the way that the blockade transformed the community and its struggle.

“Today is a bright day for First Nations children. The evidence of discrimination in the delivery of basic child welfare services, and the terrible consequences for First Nations children will finally be given the serious consideration that it deserves.” – Cindy Blackstock, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society 
The Federal Court has ruled that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal was in error when it refused to examine evidence of whether a well-established pattern of federal underfunding of child welfare and child protection services in First Nations reserves is discriminatory. 
In doing so, the Court firmly rejected the federal government’s arguments that the issue was effectively outside the scope of the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
This may finally clear the way for a full hearing into this landmark case. 
In a decision released today, the Court called the Tribunal’s handling of the complaint unfair. The Court also said that Tribunal should not have accepted government interpretations of the Human Rights Act that the Court said were “inconsistent with the search for substantive equality.. and Canada’s equality jurisprudence.” 
The Court has ruled that the substance of the discrimination complaint must now be examined by “a differently constituted panel of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.” 
The Court also affirmed that the interpretation of Canadian laws, including the Canadian Human Rights Act, should reflect the values and principles of international human rights laws and referred to instruments such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
The original discrimination complaint was filed more than five years ago by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations. 
The Federal Court decision summarized the case in this way:“The Government of Canada funds child welfare services for First Nations children living on reserves. The provinces fund child welfare services for all other Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations filed a human rights complaint … in which they allege that the Government of Canada under-funds child welfare services for on-reserve First Nations children. They say that the result of this under-funding is that the level of some of the services provided for these children is inadequate, and that other child welfare services otherwise available to Canadian children are not available to First Nations children living on reserves. The complainants allege that this amounts to discrimination in the provision of services customarily available to the public on the grounds of race and national or ethnic origin.” 
The Federal Court has instructed the Tribunal to begin hearings as soon as possible into the substance of this complaint.

In an...,"Thousands of Canadians have asked for the opportunity to express their views to a public review of the proposed Enbridge oil sands pipeline across central British Columbia to the Pacific Coast. This extraordinary display of public interest has caught the attention of the federal government. 
	In an open letter posted to his department’s website – just as the public hearings were about to begin — the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources, Joe Oliver, defined the export of oil sands crude to new markets in Asia as “an urgent matter of Canada’s national interest” and complained that opponents are “stacking public hearings… to ensure that delays kill good projects.”	While the Minister is careful to state that the regulatory system must be “fair, independent, and consider different viewpoints including those of Aboriginal communities,” the clear implications of his letter are a) that the government had already made up its mind to support the proposed pipeline and b) that the government believes that hearing from everyone who has concerns about the pipeline will simply delay a project that would otherwise get under way much sooner. 
	In a joint response from the BC First Nations Summit, the BC Union of Indian Chiefs and the BC Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Ed John states, “Federal politicians advocating for and promoting the proposed Enbridge project before the environmental review commences puts the entire review process in jeopardy. We question how the three National Energy Board panelists, who were appointed by the federal government, can fairly review this proposal when the Prime Minister and Minister of Environment openly promote what they perceive as the necessary outcome?”	The Natural Resources Minister has been saying for some time that his government wants to streamline the review process to “get these projects approved.” This quotation is from a Globe and Mail article from November.	What about projects that should never be approved? In every instance, the government has a clear obligation to ensure that fundamental human rights are protected before any project is approved. A thorough public review process is meant to provide credible public assurance that projects will only proceed if the potential social and environmental harms have been appropriately weighed and addressed . But the government’s obligations don’t end there.	In any project with the potential for serious impacts on the rights of Indigenous peoples, the free, prior and informed consent of those peoples is an essential, indispensable prerequisite. Without this consent, the projects should not go ahead. 
	The standard of free, prior and informed consent is now well-established. So well established, in fact, that the private investment arm of the World Bank has adopted a policy not to lend to projects like pipelines that do not have the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples whose rights would be affected. The Supreme Court of Canada has also recognized that there instances where projects should only proceed on the basis of consent in order to protect Constitutionally protected Aboriginal and Treaty rights. 
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is necessary to ensure that Indigenous peoples can engage in decision-making on the basis of genuine collaboration — and to end the long history of ignoring or dismissing Indigenous peoples in decisions that deeply affect them. 
	Upholding this right is a cornerstone to the long overdue reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. And that most certainly is an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is also necessary to fulfill Canada’s obligations under an international human rights system that needs the support of countries like Canada. This is also an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
	In the case of the Enbridge pipeline proposal, it’s clear that the project does not have the consent of large numbers of First Nations communities whose rights are affected. Back in March 2010, more than 28 First Nations in British Columbia called for a halt to the Northwest Gateway pipeline project.

This extraordinary display of public interest has caught the attention of the federal government. 
,  
	In an open letter posted to his department’s website – just as the public hearings were about to begin — the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources, Joe Oliver, defined the export of oil sands crude to new markets in Asia as “an urgent matter of Canada’s national interest” and complained that opponents are “stacking public hearings… to ensure that delays kill good projects.” 
, 	While the Minister is careful to state that the regulatory system must be “fair, independent, and consider different viewpoints including those of Aboriginal communities,” the clear implications of his letter are a) that the government had already made up its mind to support the proposed pipeline and b) that the government believes that hearing from everyone who has concerns about the pipeline will simply delay a project that would otherwise get under way much sooner. 
,  
	In a joint response from the BC First Nations Summit, the BC Union of Indian Chiefs and the BC Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Ed John states, “Federal politicians advocating for and promoting the proposed Enbridge project before the environmental review commences puts the entire review process in jeopardy. We question how the three National Energy Board panelists, who were appointed by the federal government, can fairly review this proposal when the Prime Minister and Minister of Environment openly promote what they perceive as the necessary outcome?” 
, 	The Natural Resources Minister has been saying for some time that his government wants to streamline the review process to “get these projects approved.” This quotation is from a Globe and Mail article from November. 
, 	What about projects that should never be approved? In every instance, the government has a clear obligation to ensure that fundamental human rights are protected before any project is approved. A thorough public review process is meant to provide credible public assurance that projects will only proceed if the potential social and environmental harms have been appropriately weighed and addressed . But the government’s obligations don’t end there. 
, 	In any project with the potential for serious impacts on the rights of Indigenous peoples, the free, prior and informed consent of those peoples is an essential, indispensable prerequisite. Without this consent, the projects should not go ahead. 
,  
	The standard of free, prior and informed consent is now well-established. So well established, in fact, that the private investment arm of the World Bank has adopted a policy not to lend to projects like pipelines that do not have the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples whose rights would be affected. The Supreme Court of Canada has also recognized that there instances where projects should only proceed on the basis of consent in order to protect Constitutionally protected Aboriginal and Treaty rights. 
,  
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is necessary to ensure that Indigenous peoples can engage in decision-making on the basis of genuine collaboration — and to end the long history of ignoring or dismissing Indigenous peoples in decisions that deeply affect them. 
,  
	Upholding this right is a cornerstone to the long overdue reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. And that most certainly is an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
,  
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is also necessary to fulfill Canada’s obligations under an international human rights system that needs the support of countries like Canada. This is also an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
,  
	In the case of the Enbridge pipeline proposal, it’s clear that the project does not have the consent of large numbers of First Nations communities whose rights are affected. Back in March 2010, more than 28 First Nations in British Columbia called for a halt to the Northwest Gateway pipeline project. This includes First Nations whose traditional lands would be crossed by the pipeline as well as First Nations concerned about the potential impact on the downstream rivers and the coastal waters on which they depend. 
, 	The Yinka Dene Alliance, a group of five First Nations that have strongly opposed the pipeline, have also reacted to the Minister’s suggestion that opposition to the pipeline is being financed and manipulated by foreign interests. 
,  
	“We’re not foreign – these are our lands,” Chief Larry Nooski of Nadleh Whut’en First Nation said in a public statement. “First Nations people are so opposed to this pipeline that we’re pulling money out of our own pockets and community members are doing everything that we can so that our voices are heard.”

Egyptians have returned to Tahrir Square many times since Hosni Mubarak fell, but rarely in these numbers. 
After the massive protest on Tuesday 27 November, some are even beginning to talk of a second uprising, a “November revolution”. 
Meanwhile President Morsi’s supporters are planning their response – a gathering in Tahrir on Saturday raising fears of clashes between the different camps. 
Not long ago, protesters were calling for an end to military rule. Today, large numbers are chanting against President Mohamed Morsi – the country’s first elected president and the man many had hoped would finally restore the rule of law. 
But instead, President Morsi has trampled on it – decreeing his decisions can’t be challenged by the courts, and that Egypt’s Constituent Assembly can’t be dissolved. The body is facing an imminent ruling on its legitimacy by Egypt’s constitutional court, and is striving to submit the draft constitution to the President today. 
Mohamed Morsi has also fired the Public Prosecutor and allowed for new investigations to be opened – if new evidence or circumstances came to light – into police officers and officials the courts have acquitted of killing protesters, as well as enacting a new law to “protect the revolution” that would allow for a pre-trial detention period of up to six months for press and media offences, strikes, protests and “thuggery”. 
Many have told us that they felt they had no choice but to return to the streets. But the days ahead are full of fear and uncertainty. Clashes between the president’s opponents and supporters have already been reported in cities across Egypt, and both camps plan more marches in the next two days. 
While Tahrir Square itself has been largely peaceful when we’ve visited, the streets leading to the nearby parliament and US embassy have become the scene of a tense and prolonged stand-off between protesters and the riot police. 
There we’ve seen the police repeatedly firing tear gas into the crowd. Some protesters have replied with Molotov cocktails. But they are the few – behind them stand the vast, irrepressible majority of peaceful protesters. 
On Tuesday, as the gas dispersed, we found one young boy sitting on a pavement, holding an empty gas canister in his hands. US-made, it had written first-aid instructions in a language the boy couldn’t read. 
Walking through the area, we saw protesters holding similar canisters. All were wondering what to make of them – why objects made so far away were once again being used on the streets of Cairo. All tear gas canisters we examined had the manufacturing date of March 2011 and had therefore been sold to Egypt after the uprising. 
The truth is tear gas has become just another fact of life for many here. As we fled another tear gas shot, we saw one of Cairo’s street vendors stoically pushing his heavy cart through the stinging fumes – determinedly following protesters back towards Tahrir Square. As the gas began to disperse, a fast-food delivery man tried to navigate the crowds on a motorcycle, beeping impatiently. Protesters chatted on their phones and tried to fend off street vendors selling tissues to offset the effects of the now dispersing gas. 
Some have died here. At Cairo’s al-Hilal hospital a doctor told us that one of the protesters, Ahmed Negib, had been left brain dead on 25 November after he was hit by glass marbles, apparently fired from a shotgun in unclear circumstances. Another protester, Fathy Gharib, admitted to the hospital on 27 November died after suffering a stroke at the massive Tahrir protest. 
The deaths have fuelled the rising anger at the authorities. Many who spoke of the president’s decree referred in the same breath to Mohamed Gaber Salah, a young teenager shot on 20 November at a protest on Cairo’s Mohamed Mahmoud Street. 
Like many, he had gone to remember the 51 people killed across Egypt, many on that the same street a year earlier. He paid with his life. Islam Masoud, another young teenager, was also killed in Damanhour, north of Egypt, while supporters and opponents of Morsi’s latest decree fought in the streets. 
Back in Tahrir Square itself we found an old friend – Azza Hilal Ahmad Suleiman. Last December, she had been targeted by soldiers after she tried to protect a woman protester. Now, grinning cheerfully, she asked us what the outside world must think of the new demonstrations. 
Sipping tea with her in Tahrir on Tuesday evening, we watched march after march pour into the square – thousands of people from all walks of life, all chanting against a president who many of them must have voted for just months ago. 
Egypt’s judges have reacted to President Morsi’s decree with outrage, denouncing it an attack on their independence. A strike called by the Judges Club has paralyzed courts around the country, including Egypt’s highest court of appeal, the Court of Cassation. 
Walking past a shut court, it was deeply unsettling to realize that a President who was once arrested while protesting for the independence of the judiciary has now become their bitterest opponent. 
And then there is the process towards a new constitution. On Wednesday, as we were speaking to leading housing activist Manal Tibe, the news broke that the Constituent Assembly had been given just a day to finalize this vital document. Months of work, and perhaps the future of generations to come, were now being condensed into a few hurried hours. 
Manal, herself a former member of the assembly and one of only seven women in the 100-strong body, spoke of her incredulity and anger at the decision. 
She’d resigned after it failed to protect key human rights such as women’s rights, freedom of religion and expression, or banning unfair trials of civilians before military courts and forced evictions. 
Like many other Egyptians, she’d long ago given up hoping that the process of writing the new constitution would be inclusive and consultative. But this latest decision was a further blow to a process that was supposed to mark Egypt’s return to human rights and rule of law. 
The latest decision was a further blow to a process that was supposed to mark Egypt’s return to human rights and rule of law. As we looked over the articles approved by the assembly this morning, our disbelief grew. Very basic provisions that would have enshrined human rights are vague or missing; there are no articles which explicitly ban discrimination against women. 
Instead, reform has been replaced with repression. The draft bans criticism of religion, and explicitly allows for the military trials of civilians – a last minute concession to the army that has written injustice into the very cornerstone of Egyptian law. 
In one tumultuous week, Egyptians have been forced in disbelief and anger back into the sidelines. Days ago, the protesters made it clear that President Morsi’s only way out was to strike down his own decree. But the botched constitutional process has only fanned the flames of the protesters’ anger. 
One thing is certain: the protesters will not accept a return to rule by decree, or accept a constitution written by a committee that doesn’t speak for them.

The government knows you are watching what happens to us. That’s why today they are being a bit more careful. Because they know you are watching.” 
This is the heartfelt, empowering message to Amnesty Canada activists from Dora Tavera, a Pijao Indigenous woman who works with the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia.

In the video, Dora speaks out courageously about the epidemic of conflict-related sexual violence against Indigenous women by all of the warring parties in Colombia, a reality that has been invisible for far too long. Given the traumatic impact on women and vulnerable Indigenous communities, this is a scourge that all who care about human rights must work to end.

It was dawn when we arrived in Israel to begin our investigation into rocket attacks from Gaza which by the end of the latest flare in violence had left six Israelis, including four civilians, dead, at least 40 injured and 300 more treated for shock. 
Up in the sky oddly shaped vapour trails made us wonder if these were the remnants of the “Iron Dome” missiles – used to intercept the rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups which this time reached as far north as Tel Aviv. 
One of the rooms in our apartment was the obligatory mamad – a bomb shelter which all new builds in Israel must have. Windowless, with reinforced walls, it’s there to protect residents during rocket attacks. 
Sleeping in its claustrophobic confines brought home to me the constant fear of rocket attack Israelis have lived with since Iraqi scud missiles were launched at Israel in 1991 during the first Gulf War. 
The mamads’ effectiveness was demonstrated to us when we viewed the ruins of the top floors of an apartment block in Rishon LeZion hit by a rocket from Gaza the night we arrived. 
Had its inhabitants not been in the mamad, they would surely have been killed. Though of course  residents of Gaza, and many people living in older housing in Israel, have no access to such a refuge. 
Kfir Rosen – one of those injured in the attack, who had decided with his brother not to enter the mamad when the siren souned at 6pm on 20 November – told us: “The alarm ended and there was nothing, not even Iron Dome. 
“Suddenly there was a huge explosion, a misty curtain of ashes and gunpowder – everything went into my throat. Blocks from above flew from the explosion: one hit my right shoulder and one the right side of my waist. 
“A piece ricocheted onto my arm and a piece of shrapnel burned my neck.  I went down the stairs and saw the massive destruction – the car park was full of ruined cars… My brother was hit too, less seriously than me; his head was bleeding.” 
In Soroka Hospital in the southern town of Be’er Sheva we interviewed several people caught in various indiscriminate rocket attacks since 14 November. Over 1,500 rockets were fired at Israel over the eight days. 
A policeman who did not wish to be be identified told us: “My 16-year-old son was playing football with his brother and friends at 8pm on 20 November when the siren sounded. 
“They all ran for shelter to a concrete wall, but when the rocket landed, a small piece of shrapnel had pierced my son’s leg, going deep into the tissue.  We hope he will be OK and will be able to play football again, but there is still the risk of infection. It’s very hard, when you are used to helping other people, to hear over the radio of such an attack and to go to the site, only to find it is your own son that has been injured.” 
Nayyaf al-Ginawi, a Palestinian citizen of Israel from the Bedouin town of Lakiya, told us: “I was driving my car when a rocket landed nearby, shattering its windows and sending shrapnel into my right hand. I’m waiting for an operation right now.” 
We drove on to another medical centre where 75-year-old Sima Deutsch had been transferred earlier in the day. She told us how she and her husband, a Holocaust survivor, had used a walker to leave their apartment to reach the building’s safe area, as there was no mamad. 
She became entangled in the walker’s wheel and fell, breaking her thigh, for which she had needed surgery. “What I’m going through is hell. It’s hard to stand on the leg. I really hope I’ll be able to walk. I’m not a sitting type… it is hard not to be able to do anything. Because of the terror of the rockets we were afraid to go out to the streets.” 
While the scale of the injuries and damage is far less than that suffered in Gaza, such indiscriminate rocket attacks always put civilian lives at risk. 
Then there was the bus bomb in Tel Aviv on 21 November – which no one has claimed responsibility for – which was clearly aimed at civilians and – like the indiscriminate rocket attacks – was a clear violation of international law. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned such attacks. 
All sides to the conflict in Israel/Gaza must put the protection of civilians at the very top of their priorities if hostilities should break out in the future.  International monitors on both sides could go a long way to deterring future violations and help provide accountability for any which do occur. 
I left Israel with the words of Yonatan Gher, AI Israel’s Director, lodged in my mind: “The first question my small son asked me was how the rockets were being fired towards Tel Aviv where we live.  That was the easy part.  The second was why.  Why should any child anywhere in the world have to ask that question?”

It’s very hard, when you are used to helping other people, to hear over the radio of such an attack and to go to the site, only to find it is your own son that has been injured.” 
,  
Nayyaf al-Ginawi, a Palestinian citizen of Israel from the Bedouin town of Lakiya, told us: “I was driving my car when a rocket landed nearby, shattering its windows and sending shrapnel into my right hand. I’m waiting for an operation right now.” 
,  
We drove on to another medical centre where 75-year-old Sima Deutsch had been transferred earlier in the day. She told us how she and her husband, a Holocaust survivor, had used a walker to leave their apartment to reach the building’s safe area, as there was no mamad. 
,  
She became entangled in the walker’s wheel and fell, breaking her thigh, for which she had needed surgery. “What I’m going through is hell. It’s hard to stand on the leg. I really hope I’ll be able to walk. I’m not a sitting type… it is hard not to be able to do anything. Because of the terror of the rockets we were afraid to go out to the streets.” 
,  
While the scale of the injuries and damage is far less than that suffered in Gaza, such indiscriminate rocket attacks always put civilian lives at risk. 
,  
Then there was the bus bomb in Tel Aviv on 21 November – which no one has claimed responsibility for – which was clearly aimed at civilians and – like the indiscriminate rocket attacks – was a clear violation of international law. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned such attacks. 
,  
All sides to the conflict in Israel/Gaza must put the protection of civilians at the very top of their priorities if hostilities should break out in the future.  International monitors on both sides could go a long way to deterring future violations and help provide accountability for any which do occur. 
,  
I left Israel with the words of Yonatan Gher, AI Israel’s Director, lodged in my mind: “The first question my small son asked me was how the rockets were being fired towards Tel Aviv where we live.  That was the easy part.  The second was why.  Why should any child anywhere in the world have to ask that question?”

The ceasefire came into effect at 9pm on November 21 November. 
The children are playing outside again, despite the torrential rain. They were stuck indoors during eight days of relentless Israeli bombardments. 
By the time that ended in excess of 160 people were dead – including more than 30 children and scores of other unarmed civilians. 
For the duration of the onslaught they were stuck indoors – at home, seeking refuge with relatives or in schools which the UN refugee agency turned into temporary shelters for thousands of families forced from their houses by the bombings. 
Not that staying indoors was necessarily safe either. Many died or were injured in their homes or those of their neighbours when the bombs fell. 
In Gaza City I found grieving members of the al-Dalu family digging through rubble looking for the bodies of relatives killed four days earlier when an Israeli fighter jet bombed their home. 
No-one in their house survived the attack during which claimed a total of 12 lives including all the 10 members of the al-Dalu family present at the time. 
Five children, four women and the father of four of the children. 
The grief-stricken owner of the house, a soft-spoken man in his mid-50s, told me of his loss, listing the names of those he’d lost. 
“My wife, Tahani, 52, my two daughters, Ranin, 25 and Yara, 16, my son Mohamed, 29 and his 25-year-old wife Samah and their four children – a seven-year-old girl called Sara and three boys, Jamal, Yousef, and Ibrahim, aged five and four years and nine months; and my 75-year-old sister Suhaila who was in a wheelchair,” he said. 
“I left the house in the morning with my son Abdallah and went to my supermarket, as we had run out of food. My wife later called me and told me also to bring some toys for the children to take their minds off the bombing. 
“In the early afternoon I was praying before heading back home and when I finished praying I found my son in tears; he said neighbours had called saying our home had been bombed. We rushed back and found a pile of rubble where our house had been. 
“There were no survivors. I lost everything that was dearest to me. Why? Were my wife, my children and my grandchildren and my paralyzed sister terrorists? Did they harm Israel in any way? I want to see justice done; I don’t want anything else; only justice. The International Criminal Court should do its duty so that those responsible for these crimes are brought to justice.” 
Next door, two neighbours – a 79-year-old woman and her grandson – were crushed to death by the collapsing walls of the al-Dalu family house. Others in their family were injured. 
In another neighbourhood five-year-old Mohammed Abu Zur and two of his aunts were killed and 25 other relatives, 15 of them children, injured when their neighbours’ house was bombed. They are the victims of so called “collateral damage” caused by reckless bombardments which the Israeli army launched against densely populated residential areas. 
They knew that they were almost certain to kill and injure unarmed civilians not involved in the conflict and to cause destruction and damage far beyond their actual targets. 
And these cases are not exceptional. In the few days I’ve been here in Gaza I’ve investigated many more cases of children and other unarmed civilians killed and injured in Israeli bombardment between 14 and 21 November. 
Once again civilians bore the brunt. The impunity afforded to those responsible for similar attacks in the past has no doubt contributed to their recurrence during this latest escalation of the conflict. What is needed now is an independent investigation to ensure that victims are not once again denied justice and reparation.

The Athabasca Chipewyan First...,"The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta has filed a potentially groundbreaking legal challenge over the failure of the federal and provincial governments to protect Indigenous land rights in the face of oilsands development on their traditional territory. 
	The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN) is challenging the proposed expansion of Shell’s Jackpine Mine north of Fort McMurray. The ACFN argues that the federal and provincial governments, which both have to give approval to the project, have not  taken proper account of Aboriginal and Treaty rights protected in the Canadian Constitution. 
	A joint federal-provincial environmental assessment panel is scheduled to begin public hearings next Monday. The joint panel announced today that it will decide this week whether or not it will first consider the ACFN Constitutional challenge. 
	Amnesty International has joined other social justice and environmental organizations in signing a joint statement of support for the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation’s legal challenge.  The joint statement says that the federal and provincial governments have failed to meaningfully address the overall impacts of development on ACFN’s treaty rights. The statement also says that Alberta’s approach to consultation “does not promote reconciliation with the rights and interests of First Nations.” 
	The proposed expansion to the Jackpine Mine would increase bitumen production by 100,000 barrels a day. 
	A different review panel will later examine a separate proposal by Shell to open an additional oil sands mine in the territory. This is part of a much larger planned expansion of oil sands production in the region. 
	Shell’s own submission to the review panel describes massive environmental disruption and habitat loss as a result of the cumulative impact of all the planned development. 
	In previous reports, Amnesty International has criticized the resource licensing process in Alberta both for failing to properly consider the cumulative impacts of resource development on Indigenous peoples’ use of the land and for failing to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples under national and international law to be fully and meaningfully involved in all decisions affected the lands they use.

	Amnesty International will comment on Canada’s obligations under international human rights law to respect and uphold the land rights of Indigenous peoples in the licensing of resource extraction projects. 
	The opportunity to present our analysis to the panel is significant for a number of reasons. 
	In June, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld an earlier decision recognizing that the Tsilhqot’in people have Aboriginal land use rights in the territory. The Tsilhqot’in are continuing to pursue legal recognition and protection of their title or ownership of lands and resources in the territory. 
	In 2010, a similar mine proposal by the same company was rejected by the federal cabinet on the basis of an environmental impact assessment that found that found that the mine would cause significant, unavoidable and irreparable harm. 
	The review of the revised proposal will be one of the first joint federal-provincial impact assessments to be carried out since changes were made to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act earlier this year that potentially severely restrict the scope and nature of such assessments. 
	Amnesty International has previously commented about this case that, “The right of Indigenous peoples to maintain their way of life – and not be deprived of their means of subsistence – is not simply one factor among others, to be considered or discounted at the discretion of government. These are fundamental human rights that are given the highest standard of protection in international law, just as Canadian courts have said that protection of Indigenous rights is ‘an underlying constitutional value’ and ‘a matter of national honour.’”

While extremely welcome and long overdue, repatriation is simply the start of a new chapter in this decade old saga. 
Up until now, many of us expected the battle around Omar Khadr’s transfer to be settled in the Canadian courts. While today’s transfer pre-empts yet another inevitable negative decision – the courts have consistently ruled against the government over the years – Canada is not off the hook. An explanation for the long delay is owed not just to Omar Khadr, but to the Canadian public. 
This case has always been about the fundamental injustice of Guantanamo Bay and the decision to repeatedly interrogate and subject a child combatant to an unfair trial by military commission that failed to meet international standards for fair trials. No one should have been transferred to a detention facility operating outside the rule of law, let alone the dozens of children aged 11-17 who ended up there including, of course, Omar Khadr. All of this happened in 2002 just after the international community had embraced a landmark agreement on child soldiers – an initiative led by none other than Canada. Instead of demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration, they faced torture and ill-treatment, unlawful detention and the hopelessness of indefinite legal limbo. 
For better or worse, the 2010 plea agreement opened the door to Omar Khadr’s case finally being moved out of Guantanamo and into the Canadian system. It is hoped that a degree of fairness will finally surround this case – even the Minister conceded that the next steps, including the prospect of parole, should be in the hands of the Correctional Service of Canada and not the realm of politics. 
The courts, UN bodies and numerous NGOs including Amnesty International have repeatedly pointed to the outstanding human rights violations yet to be remedied in Omar Khadr’s case. The allegations of torture and ill-treatment are credible and troubling, and must finally be investigated. Canadian officials were also found to have violated Omar Khadr’s Charter rights when they continued to interrogate him in Guantanamo despite the fact that his detention and treatment violated international standards. His status as a child combatant – and the obligations that follow from that – also continue to go unacknowledged. 
Discussions of remedy often zero in on matters of financial compensation and apologies. But a vital part of the picture is also the need to ensure non-repetition. For far too long, Canada has been inconsistent in its approach to Canadians detained abroad facing serious human rights violations. Omar Khadr’s case stands out as one of the most spectacular failures to stand up for a citizen. We must work towards a system where citizens receive equal protection and the government pursues opportunities for effective engagement in a timely way. A citizen should not have to go to court to force action in cases where the human rights violations are as blatant as they are in a case like Omar Khadr.

Omar Khadr was held in US custody for over ten years. He was detained at the age of 15 during a firefight in Afghanistan in July 2002. Although seriously injured, his interrogation started in the detention facility in Bagram. He was later transferred to Guantánamo Bay in October 2002 after he had turned 16. 
In October 2010, he was sentenced to 40 years in detention by a military commission, reduced to 8 years in a plea agreement with no credit for time served. After one further year in detention in Guantánamo, Omar Khadr because eligible for a transfer to Canadian custody in October 2011. He was transferred to Canada on September 29, 2012. 
Where is Omar Khadr now? What are his prison conditions?	Omar Khadr is currently held in Millhaven Institution, a maximum security prison in Bath, Ontario (near Kingston). He is currently undergoing an assessment which typically takes about 6 weeks. At the end of this process he will likely be moved to another institution. During this time he is in a cell 23 hours day, however he does have greatly improved access to both his family and legal team. 
There seems to be ongoing debate over whether or not Omar Khadr was a child soldier. What is Amnesty International’s position on this?	The applicable law here is the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. It defines a child soldier as anyone under the age of 18. In the case of non-state groups, no distinction is made between voluntary or forced recruitment. 
The Optional Protocol came into force on 12 February 2002. Canada was a champion of this work and initially recognized Omar Khadr as a child combatant before the case became heavily politicized. In a 5 September 2002 Dept of Foreign Affairs press release about the case of Omar Khadr, the Canadian government noted that “It is an unfortunate reality that juveniles are too often the victims in military actions and that many groups and countries actively recruit and use them in armed conflicts and in terrorist activities.” 
The distinction is important given that child soldiers are often forced to commit abuses. Rather than focus on punishment for any alleged crimes, however, the emphasis is on demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers out of recognition of their age and the vulnerability associated with that (including indoctrination).	Bodies such as the International Criminal Court seek to hold responsible those who have recruited and exploited child soldiers. 
Amnesty International called for Omar Khadr’s repatriation for many years. Now that he is back in Canada is the case closed?	While the long-delayed transfer is welcome, this case is far from closed. This case has always been about the fundamental injustice of Guantánamo Bay and the decision to repeatedly interrogate and subject a child combatant to an unfair trial by military commission that failed to meet international standards for fair trials. 
The courts, UN bodies and numerous NGOs including Amnesty International have repeatedly pointed to the outstanding human rights violations yet to be remedied in Omar Khadr’s case.

We must work towards a system where citizens receive equal protection and the government pursues opportunities for effective engagement in a timely way. A citizen should not have to go to court to force action in cases where the human rights violations are as blatant as they are in a case like Omar Khadr. 
How can you defend the rights of Omar Khadr and others alleged to have been involved in “terrorism”? Aren’t they threats to human rights?	Action on Omar Khadr’s case is in the context of our overall work on Guantánamo, Bagram and other forms of illegal detention in the context of the so-called “war on terror”. From the outset, we were concerned that international law, and consequently some important national law including that of the US, was being set aside in the name of security and exceptionalism. 
We are part of a tradition — started in part by Canada in 1948 — of protecting human rights against those would make the application of those rights conditional rather than universal. We seek to protect human rights no matter who the perpetrator is and no matter who the victim is. This does mean that at times we are defending the human rights of people who are considered less than worthy in many quarters. Non-discrimination, however, is itself a fundamental principle of human rights. 
Amnesty International has consistently condemned attacks on civilians while simultaneously calling for the alleged perpetrators to be held responsible through fair trials and treated humanely in the process. What we say now about al Qaida or Taliban-related detainees resembles what we have said in past about, for example, IRA prisoners in the UK. 
Have any conditions have been placed on Omar Khadr? 
The military commission plea agreement from October 2010 placed these conditions on Omar Khadr: 
  
He must drop all current legal proceedings and may not start any new court actions in any country against the United States or any official in their personal or official capacity with regard to his “capture, detention, prosecution to include discovery practice, post conviction confinement and/or detainee combatant status.” 
He cannot in any way engage in or support hostilities (or organizations which engage in hostilities) against the United States or its coalition partners. 
He must continue to submit to interviews by US law enforcement officials, intelligence agent and prosecutors while in US custody. While legal counsel will be notified, they do not have to be present for these interviews. He must agree to cooperate and testify in any proceedings of requested by the US government. 
He will never enter the US or any territories or military installations or US airspace following his transfer to Canadian custody. 
He cannot profit from his story. Any profits or proceeds which he receives in connection with any “publication or dissemination of information relating to the illegal conduct alleged on the charge sheet” will be assigned to the Government of Canada. 
At this point it is not known if any further conditions will be placed on Omar Khadr following his return to Canada. 
What’s next for Omar Khadr?	Omar Khadr’s case is now in the hands of the Correctional Service of Canada. He will be eligible to apply for parole by the summer of 2013. 
A long-standing civil case addressing the violations of his rights under Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – most notably when Canadian officials continued to interrogate him in Guantánamo despite the fact that his detention and treatment violated international standards — may also start to move forward in the courts. 
What’s next for Amnesty International’s campaigning on this case?	We are calling on the Canadian government to:

What we say now about al Qaida or Taliban-related detainees resembles what we have said in past about, for example, IRA prisoners in the UK. 
,  
Have any conditions have been placed on Omar Khadr? 
,  
The military commission plea agreement from October 2010 placed these conditions on Omar Khadr: 
,  
  
,  
He must drop all current legal proceedings and may not start any new court actions in any country against the United States or any official in their personal or official capacity with regard to his “capture, detention, prosecution to include discovery practice, post conviction confinement and/or detainee combatant status.” 
,  
He cannot in any way engage in or support hostilities (or organizations which engage in hostilities) against the United States or its coalition partners. 
,  
He must continue to submit to interviews by US law enforcement officials, intelligence agent and prosecutors while in US custody. While legal counsel will be notified, they do not have to be present for these interviews. He must agree to cooperate and testify in any proceedings of requested by the US government. 
,  
He will never enter the US or any territories or military installations or US airspace following his transfer to Canadian custody. 
,  
He cannot profit from his story. Any profits or proceeds which he receives in connection with any “publication or dissemination of information relating to the illegal conduct alleged on the charge sheet” will be assigned to the Government of Canada. 
,  
At this point it is not known if any further conditions will be placed on Omar Khadr following his return to Canada. 
,  
What’s next for Omar Khadr? 
, 	Omar Khadr’s case is now in the hands of the Correctional Service of Canada. He will be eligible to apply for parole by the summer of 2013. 
,  
A long-standing civil case addressing the violations of his rights under Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – most notably when Canadian officials continued to interrogate him in Guantánamo despite the fact that his detention and treatment violated international standards — may also start to move forward in the courts.

,  
Moreover, the project was touted as a way to help combat the effects of recurrent droughts in La Guajira, a north-eastern region. 
,  
But for the Wiwa Indigenous Peoples native to the area’s Sierra de Santa Marta mountains, the dam’s arrival signalled a devastating change in their way of life accompanied by a series of serious human rights abuses. 
,  
From 2002 onwards, Wiwa communities living in and near the planned construction area suffered a consistent pattern of intimidation, destruction of homes, attacks against places of cultural significance and threats and killings of their spiritual and community leaders, carried out by the security forces operating in alliance with paramilitary forces. Guerrilla groups operating in the region were also responsible for killings and threats against members of the Wiwa population. 
,  
By the time construction on the dam began in 2006, many members of Wiwa Indigenous communities were forcibly displaced from their homes. 
,  
All this took place in a context where the Wiwa were not adequately consulted about the dam and its effects – they only had one meeting with the regional environmental agency in May 2005. 
,  
Wiwa community members made clear that any decision would have to be reached by the decision-making body which represents the four Indigenous Peoples of the Sierra Nevada. The Colombian authorities did not waver from their plan to complete the US$360 million dam and three months later they issued a license to proceed with its construction. 
,  
To this day the Wiwa are campaigning to receive redress for the devastating impact the project has had on their lives. 
,  
“Sadly, the Wiwa case is not unique, but is symptomatic of an increasing pattern across the Americas where governments are trampling over the rights of Indigenous Peoples in the name of economic development,” said Mariano Machain, Amnesty International’s Campaigner on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Americas. 
,  
Extracting riches 
,  
Governments have a duty to protect against human rights abuses by corporations. 
,  
Among the many foreign companies carrying out extractive projects on or near Indigenous land in the Americas is Canada-based Goldcorp, which since 2003 has run the Marlin gold mine in San Marcos, Guatemala. 
,  
Goldcorp’s failure to properly consult some 18 Indigenous Maya communities in the area affected by the mine has divided the communities and sparked a string of human rights abuses. 
,  
In July 2010, grassroots activist Deodora Hernández was shot at close range and seriously injured in her own home in San Marcos by two unidentified men. She had spoken out to defend her community’s right to water amidst fears that mining had polluted the local water supply. 
,  
In February 2011, protesters were attacked after speaking out against Marlin mine. Community activist Aniceto López, was taken to the local mayor’s office, where he was allegedly beaten and threats were made against his life if he failed to stop speaking out against the mine. 
,  
Goldcorp has argued that it met its obligations under national law to consult with the communities in advance, but the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples has pointed out that those obligations fall well below international standards on consultation and consent. 
,  
Taking on the corporations and the laws 
,  
National standards in this respect are lacking in countries across the region. 
,  
For nearly two decades, the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group (HTG) in British Columbia, Canada, have been in negotiations with the federal and provincial governments in an effort to gain legal recognition of their land rights. 
,  
While these negotiations drag on, logging and other companies have been allowed to buy, sell and exploit lands that the Hul’qumi’num still rely on for subsistence and ceremony. 
,  
Frustrated with the government’s failure to protect their rights, the HTG have been forced to take their case to the continental human rights arbiter, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. 
,  
HTG negotiator Robert Morales summed up the stance of many Indigenous Peoples who find themselves at loggerheads with governments and corporations who threaten their rights: 
,  
“[We] are not asking…to turn back the clock and investigate historic wrongs. We’re urging effective protection of our land rights so that we can address the ongoing deforestation and other development activities happening on our land today.” 
,  
Slow progress 
,  
Despite myriad cases across the Americas where Indigenous Peoples – often with the support of Amnesty International and other civil society organizations – continue to fight to have their rights respected, there have been some glimmers of hope since last year. 
,  
In August 2011, Peru approved a law on Indigenous Peoples’ right to consultation when they are likely to be affected by planned development projects. While reaction to the measure was initially positive – it is the first of its kind in the Americas – the negotiations broke down with Peru’s Indigenous Peoples about further regulation and implementation. 
,  
Paraguayan authorities reached a deal in February 2012 to restore ancestral territory to the Yakye Axa Indigenous community, who had fought a two-decade legal battle to return after being forced off their lands by ranchers. But they are still waiting to get access to those lands. Other Indigenous Peoples in Paraguay, like the Sawhoyamaxa, are still awaiting the resolution of their longstanding land disputes. 
,  
And just last month, after a long legal battle, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found Ecuador responsible for violating the rights of the Kichwa Indigenous People of Sarayaku after it allowed oil exploration on their ancestral lands in the Amazon rainforest. 
,  
Sarayaku leader José Gualinga is convinced that the Sarayaku victory will have an impact in the whole region. 
,  
“We’ll be watching to ensure the ruling is complied with and that the territories of Indigenous peoples in Ecuador and across the Americas are respected in the face of damaging extractive activities such as oil exploration. Long live Sarayaku and the Indigenous peoples of the continent,” said Gualinga. 
,  
Amnesty International will continue to campaign alongside the region’s Indigenous Peoples to ensure their rights are respected. 
,  
“These small glimmers of hope show that with tenacity and resolve, Indigenous Peoples can overcome the odds to ensure states respect their rights,” said Machain. 
,  
“From the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego, we’re calling on all governments in the Americas to respect the right of Indigenous peoples to consultation and free, prior and informed consent. Authorities must work with them to ensure development projects do not neglect or threaten their rights.”

This is despite often greater needs and the higher costs of delivering services in small and remote communities. The federal underfunding of First Nations children’s services has created a crisis situation in which First Nations children are much more likely to be put into foster care because the supports necessary to meet their needs in their own homes and communities simply aren’t available. 
	The federal government’s longstanding failure to close the funding gap led the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society to file a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2007. Five years later, there still hasn’t been a hearing into the evidence. 
	The federal government has opposed the case on technical grounds, arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Act should not appy to federal funding decisions affecting the quality of services available in First Nations communities. Last month, a court firmly rejected the federal government’s arguments, clearing the way for a full hearing into the evidence before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. 
	Last Friday, however, the federal government appealed this decision. 
	Reacting to the news that the resolution of the case could be put off yet again, Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society said, “It is so disappointing to see the federal government put its interests ahead of the interests of children again by pursuing these legal technicalities and trying to avoid a full hearing on the discrimination matter.”

The Ontario Provincial Police claim that all the Ipperwash Inquiry’s recommendations directed to them have been addressed. For its part, the province appears satisfied that the OPP’s work is done. 
	This week, however, a prominent United Nations human rights body meeting in Geneva is questioning this claim. 
	The Ipperwash Inquiry was a response to longstanding concerns over how police and the provincial government responded to the 1995 occupation of Ipperwash Provincial Park. Dudley George, an unarmed protester, had been shot and killed by a police sniper after the OPP moved to break up the occupation. 
	During the Inquiry, the OPP pointed to a policy framework that it had adopted after the killing of Dudley George. The Framework for Police Preparedness for Aboriginal Critical Incidents states that the OPP will “make every effort prior to understand the issues and to protect the rights of all involved parties…” and will “promote and develop strategies that minimize the use of force to the fullest extent possible.” 
	The Inquiry report endorsed the Framework, but it went even further. Noting that police and politicians are often under intense public pressure to end Aboriginal protests quickly, the Inquiry took up a recommendation from the OPP, calling for the province to adopt a similar “peacekeeping” model as official policy across all relevant departments. The Inquiry report also called on the Province to carry out an independent assessment to determine how effectively the Framework has been adopted into OPP procedures and organizational culture. 
	Five years later, despite the McGuinty government’s pledge to fully implement the Ipperwash Inquiry, the government has yet to adopt the recommended province-wide policy on Aboriginal protests. Nor has there been an independent assessment of how well the OPP is living up to its own policy framework. 
	Last year, Amnesty International published a detailed case study of how the OPP responded to protests over a longstanding land claim in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory near Belleville. On two occasions, in 2007 and 2008, the OPP mobilized hundreds of officers, including its highest level of response, the Tactics and Rescue Unit, commonly known as the sniper squad. This preparation to use lethal force took place despite the fact that no evidence has ever been presented that the protest constituted a serious threat to public safety. 
	In the April 2008 incident, a confrontation between protesters and police escalated to the point that OPP officers aimed high powered rifles at unarmed protesters and bystanders. During the subsequent trial of activists charged in connection with the incidents, the trial judge commented on the efforts that many of those arrested had made to prevent tensions with police and non-Aboriginal counter-protesters from escalating. In contrast, the judge noted that miscommunication among the OPP, including a broken promise not to arrest protesters escorting elders from the site, had contributed to the situation getting out of control. During the trial, one officer with the Tactics and Rescue Unit, asked about the appropriate response to Aboriginal protest, said that he was not very familiar with the OPP framework. 
	Standards for police use of force, police accountability and respect for the right to protest are all matters protected in international human rights law. This week, Canada makes its regular report before the United Nations Committee against Torture – the independent expert body that oversees the international convention for the prevention of torture and ill-treatment. The Committee has asked Canadian representatives to explain the failure to fully implement the Ipperwash Inquiry and the lack of a probe into police handling of the protests at Tyendinaga. 
	These are good questions. It’s unfortunate that they are being asked Geneva, rather than being answered at Queen’s Park.

,  
	Last March, the Committee issued an interim report that called for a comprehensive, strategic and coordinated approach to end the vastly disproportionate rates of violence against Indigenous women. The final report tabled in Parliament today drops the call for a comprehensive response and instead focuses primarily on government initiatives that are already underway. 
,  
	Although the report discusses the housing crisis plaguing many Indigenous communities, the severe shortage of emergency shelters for Indigenous women, and the large numbers of Indigenous children being placed in foster care, the report offers no recommendations for countering these critical obstacles to Indigenous women escaping violence. 
,  
	The only recommendation on the widespread impoverishment of Indigenous communities is a call to “work towards removing barriers to economic growth for on-reserve Aboriginal peoples.” The report calls only for further discussion to determine what more can be done for victims and their families within existing models and existing budgets.

However, international human rights bodies have been raising concerns for years about the conditions in many Indigenous communities in Canada. 
After visiting a number of First Nations communities in 2007, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing called on Canada to “intensify measures to close the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.” Basic services are taken for granted by most Canadians. Indigenous peoples’ rights to these services are not diminished by the fact of living in remote communities. 
The federal government has never engaged in a proper, comprehensive assessment of Attawapiskat’s needs and why these needs are not being met. However, when the housing crisis became a national scandal, the government’s first reaction was to remove the Chief and Council’s authority by placing the community under third party management. According to media reports, the government’s offer of emergency housing is conditional on accepting this third party management. 
	In a joint statement issued today, Amnesty International, KAIROS, and the Canadian Friends Service Committee have called on the federal government to work in good faith with the community of Attiwapiskat to address its immediate needs. The organizations also called on the government to honour its constitutional and international human rights obligations and work in collaboration with First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities and their representative organizations to develop systematic and sustainable solutions to gaps in social services and quality of life.

The workers of a forest company kicked me and my family off a property. We were told we were trespassing. We live in fear of arrest or harm when we attempt to continue our traditional lifestyle in our own territory. We have difficulty carrying out our ceremonies, harvesting wood, medicines, food, hunting, bathing or fishing in our own territory. These have serious consequences for the health, strength, spirituality and survival of our Hul’qumi’num people.” — Hul’qumi’num elder Luschiim 
On Friday October 28, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights heard the moving testimony of a Hul’qumi’num elder, Luschiim, who talked about being denied access to lands that are essential for ceremonies, for hunting and fishing, and for gathering foods and medicines. The situation faced by the Hul’qumi’num people of British Columbia is avoidable and it is shameful. Amnesty International is fully in agreement with the Hulquminum Treaty Group that it  represents a clear violation of well established international standards for the protection and fulfillment of human rights. 
Canada’s response at the Commission was nothing more than an empty assurance that the processes available to resolve land rights disputes in Canada will work — eventually. 
In fact, this case came before the Inter American Commission precisely because of Canada’s failure to provide a fair and timely way to resolve the numerous long outstanding Indigenous land rights disputes across Canada. Such disputes can drag on for years or even decades without resolution. In the meantime, governments and corporations are able to get away with using the land for their own benefit with little regard for the rights and interests of Indigenous communities who are most deeply affected by their actions. 
This is fundamentally unjust. It denies Indigenous peoples a key opportunity to close the gap in quality of life and standard of living that they face. And it erects a barrier to the reconciliation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada. This should be of pressing concern to anyone who cares about the universal protection of human rights. 
And Canada, a country that has played such a central role in the development of international human rights standards and institutions, and which prides itself on this contribution to the world, must be expected to uphold these same human rights obligations at home, without excuses, without double standards and without discrimination. 
More than a dozen Indigenous peoples’ organizations and human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have filed legal briefs in support of the case. 
In a joint statement about the case released this week, Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come, Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) said, “Fair and timely resolution of land and resource disputes is essential for reconciliation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada and for closing the unacceptable gap in standard of living facing so many Indigenous communities. We hope that the intervention of the international human rights body can be a catalyst for rethinking government policies and approaches that have so blatantly failed Indigenous peoples and the cause of justice.”

This extraordinary display of public interest has caught the attention of the federal government. 
	In an open letter posted to his department’s website – just as the public hearings were about to begin — the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources, Joe Oliver, defined the export of oil sands crude to new markets in Asia as “an urgent matter of Canada’s national interest” and complained that opponents are “stacking public hearings… to ensure that delays kill good projects.”	While the Minister is careful to state that the regulatory system must be “fair, independent, and consider different viewpoints including those of Aboriginal communities,” the clear implications of his letter are a) that the government had already made up its mind to support the proposed pipeline and b) that the government believes that hearing from everyone who has concerns about the pipeline will simply delay a project that would otherwise get under way much sooner. 
	In a joint response from the BC First Nations Summit, the BC Union of Indian Chiefs and the BC Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Ed John states, “Federal politicians advocating for and promoting the proposed Enbridge project before the environmental review commences puts the entire review process in jeopardy. We question how the three National Energy Board panelists, who were appointed by the federal government, can fairly review this proposal when the Prime Minister and Minister of Environment openly promote what they perceive as the necessary outcome?”	The Natural Resources Minister has been saying for some time that his government wants to streamline the review process to “get these projects approved.” This quotation is from a Globe and Mail article from November.	What about projects that should never be approved? In every instance, the government has a clear obligation to ensure that fundamental human rights are protected before any project is approved. A thorough public review process is meant to provide credible public assurance that projects will only proceed if the potential social and environmental harms have been appropriately weighed and addressed . But the government’s obligations don’t end there.	In any project with the potential for serious impacts on the rights of Indigenous peoples, the free, prior and informed consent of those peoples is an essential, indispensable prerequisite. Without this consent, the projects should not go ahead. 
	The standard of free, prior and informed consent is now well-established. So well established, in fact, that the private investment arm of the World Bank has adopted a policy not to lend to projects like pipelines that do not have the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples whose rights would be affected. The Supreme Court of Canada has also recognized that there instances where projects should only proceed on the basis of consent in order to protect Constitutionally protected Aboriginal and Treaty rights. 
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is necessary to ensure that Indigenous peoples can engage in decision-making on the basis of genuine collaboration — and to end the long history of ignoring or dismissing Indigenous peoples in decisions that deeply affect them. 
	Upholding this right is a cornerstone to the long overdue reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. And that most certainly is an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
	Respect for the right of free, prior and informed consent is also necessary to fulfill Canada’s obligations under an international human rights system that needs the support of countries like Canada. This is also an urgent matter in Canada’s national interest. 
	In the case of the Enbridge pipeline proposal, it’s clear that the project does not have the consent of large numbers of First Nations communities whose rights are affected. Back in March 2010, more than 28 First Nations in British Columbia called for a halt to the Northwest Gateway pipeline project. This includes First Nations whose traditional lands would be crossed by the pipeline as well as First Nations concerned about the potential impact on the downstream rivers and the coastal waters on which they depend.	The Yinka Dene Alliance, a group of five First Nations that have strongly opposed the pipeline, have also reacted to the Minister’s suggestion that opposition to the pipeline is being financed and manipulated by foreign interests. 
	“We’re not foreign – these are our lands,” Chief Larry Nooski of Nadleh Whut’en First Nation said in a public statement. “First Nations people are so opposed to this pipeline that we’re pulling money out of our own pockets and community members are doing everything that we can so that our voices are heard.”

After years of advocacy from survivors and activists, Bill C-4 made it illegal to promote, advertise, benefit from, or subject another person to this harmful practice. This historic win represents another gain for LGBTQ2S individuals in Canada and further shapes the country’s intersectional focus on the community. 
The federal government’s commitment of $100 million spread over the next five years to support the implementation of the forthcoming National LGBTQ2 Action Plan under Women and Gender Equality (WAGE) is a strong step forward for the LGBTQ2S community. This dedicated funding will not only respond to the continued health, social, and economic inequities faced by LGBTQ2S individuals, it will also directly provide much needed support to LGBTQ2S-led community organizations in Canada. 
While signaling a greater equitable landscape in the country, missing from this year’s federal budget was the inclusion of a special ambassador for global LGBTI rights whose role would be to lead this international effort. At a time when the world is enduring multiple ongoing conflicts, the safety and security of LGBTI communities is compromised and its members, and especially, activists, experience increased vulnerabilities. International support for LGBTI rights becomes critical, and in Ukraine, the conflict situation has made it life threatening for LGBTI people to stay in the country and has brought the future of LGBTI rights at risk. People fleeing externally aren’t necessarily being welcomed by LGBTI-supportive countries, presenting additional safety challenges. Meanwhile, racialized refugees in Ukraine who have not had the same access to resettlement (for example, over 300 Afghan LGBTI refugees are still waiting to be relocated after having fled to Ukraine following the Taliban takeover last August). Many relocation measures are limited to Ukrainian nationals meaning that non-nationals who are residents are not getting access to the same support. 
Canada has pledged an additional $100 million in humanitarian aid and Amnesty, together with many partner organizations, released a letter calling on the government to ensure that the aid would be inclusive of LGBTI communities, especially whose organizations are not all equipped for the long-term. There are mounting concerns over shortages and a lack of access to treatments for those with HIV and hormone replacement therapies for transgender and intersex people. The provision of these medications is unfairly de-prioritized for larger humanitarian organizations. 
In Afghanistan, the situation for LGBTI individuals is life threatening, where same-sex relations have been criminalized since 2018 and especially after the Taliban offensive in August 2021. Reports have emerged of the precarity under which LGBTI people are now living in Afghanistan, with many afraid to reveal their sexual orientation to anyone, fearing being found by the Taliban. Significantly, while the Taliban has made verbal overtures (and albeit failed promises) to protect women’s rights, they have made zero mention of protecting the rights of LGBTI people.

Mawada el-Adham’s appeal against her ruling is pending. Hanin Hossam is currently being retried, as provided by Egyptian law for those convicted in their absence. They must be immediately released, as they are being punished solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.  
23-year-old Hanin Hossam and 21-year-old Mawada el-Adham are serving unjust lengthy prison sentences, following their conviction by Cairo’s Criminal Court in June 2021 of inciting young women to broadcast “indecent” content on social media to earn money, commercial exploitation, human trafficking and other offences. Amnesty International believes that they are being punished for the way they dance, talk, dress and attempt to “influence” the public online, amid the authorities’ crackdown on women’s freedom of expression and attempts to police the conduct of women online. The organization reviewed the videos that led to their convictions, as well as their verdicts, and found no credible evidence linking the two women to acts that would amount to trafficking in persons, as defined by the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, or other internationally recognizable criminal offences.  
During the issuing of the verdict, the presiding judge openly expressed bias and hostility against the women, accusing them of tarnishing the nation’s morals and warning against using social media tools to undermine Egypt’s values. Mawada el-Adham’s appeal against her six-year prison sentence is pending. Hanin Hossam, who was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in her absence, is now standing trial again in accordance with the Egyptian Code of Criminal Procedures, which gives those convicted in their absence the possibility to request a retrial. Amnesty International is concerned about Hanin Hossam’s mental health, as she repeatedly expressed her despair during her court hearings. On 20 December 2021, she told the presiding judge: “I live in a swamp, in a swamp I swear, and I am dying 100 times every day because my future is lost”. Her next hearing is scheduled for 22 March 2022. They were held in al-Qanater prison for women at the time of writing.

Additional information  
Since April 2020, the Egyptian authorities have intensified their crackdown on social media influencers in an apparent attempt to police women’s bodies and conduct and undermine their ability to earn an independent living. Since then, the Egyptian authorities have arrested and prosecuted 10 women TikTok influencers for violating the draconian cyber-crimes law, and other overly vague legal provisions related to “decency” and “inciting immorality”. Those prosecuted all have large followings on social media, ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million. Nine of the 10 women were sentenced to prison terms ranging between two and 10 years and heavy fines on morality-related or other bogus charges, and at least seven of them remained unjustly imprisoned at the time of writing. Their arrests followed complaints made mainly by male content creators purportedly outraged by the women’s behaviour and investigations by the Morality Directorate of the Ministry of Interior. According to Hanin Hossam’s police investigation report, which was reviewed by Amnesty International, the role of the directorate is to “prosecute those using online applications and websites to publish content inciting citizens, especially young people, to act in a way that contravenes with customs and traditions or spread ideas and acts of immorality and debauchery in society.” On 29 April 2020, the public prosecution issued a statement ”reaffirm[ing] its commitment to continue fighting shameful crimes violating the principles and values of our society”, warning again on 2 May 2020 that Egypt was protecting the “new cyber border… abused by forces of evil”.  
The authorities first arrested Hanin Hossam on 21 April 2020 and Mawada el-Adham on 14 May 2020, and referred them to trial on charges of “violating family principles and values” and inciting “indecency” and “debauchery”. On 27 July 2020, a Misdemeanours Cairo Economic Court convicted and sentenced them to two years in prison and a fine of 300,000 EGP (around 19,000 USD) each. On 12 January 2021, an appeal court acquitted Hanin Hossam for lack of incriminating evidence, and commuted Mawada el-Adham’s sentence to a fine.   
However, the public prosecution indicted them on separate charges, including human trafficking, and referred them to criminal court. According to the verdict of the Cairo Criminal Court issued on 20 June 2021, the court used videos described as “indecent” as evidence to convict them, including a video of Mawada el-Adham “dancing in public wearing indecent clothes for seduction” and Hanin Hossam’s advertisement video “inciting immorality (…) in pursuit of profits”. In the Instagram video that led to her conviction, Hanin Hossam, who has over one million followers on TikTok, encouraged women over the age of 18 to post videos of themselves on the application Likee, that is monetized based on the number of viewers. Mawada el-Adham, who has over three million followers on TikTok, was convicted based on TikTok videos showing her dancing with a six-year-old girl and jokingly asking her if she was dating. In court, the girl’s parents raised the issue of their consent to post the videos online.   
Following the ruling by the Cairo Criminal Court on 20 June 2021, Hanin Hossam appeared in a video on Instagram expressing her shock over the lengthy sentence and appealing to the president: “What did I do? 10 years! Since I was released (after nine months of pre-trial detention), I did not speak out or complain or say that I was unjustly detained or suffered (…) Why do you want to jail me again?”. She also expressed her confusion for being punished for her involvement in promoting the Likee application as it was legal in Egypt. Hanin Hossam, who had been released on bail on 2 February 2021 after her acquittal in the first case, was rearrested on 22 June 2021.  
According to police investigations in this case dated 23 April 2020 and examined by Amnesty International, ten suspects were accused of “establishing a criminal group”, including four Chinese executives of Bigo Limited company, which owns the Likee application. The company remains legally registered in Egypt, and investigations against its executives were closed. In a meeting with the Chinese ambassador in Cairo on 30 August 2020, the Public Prosecutor confirmed that no legal actions had been taken against the company and its executives “in light of the distinction between the personal responsibility and the company’s responsibility”. The Chinese ambassador expressed his respect for the customs and traditions of the Egyptian society. On 20 June 2021, three Egyptian men were convicted and sentenced to six years in prison and a fine of 200,000 EGP (around 12,800 USD), each in relation to the same case purportedly for assisting Hanin Hossam and Mawada al-Adham to commit human trafficking.

A bill being considered by Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies would severely restrict the work of civil society groups in Mexico and violate Mexico’s international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. Legislators should shelve the proposal. 
The bill was introduced by a legislator from President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s party, Morena, which holds a majority in both houses of Congress. It would prohibit non-profit organizations from trying to influence or change laws either through lobbying or through strategic litigation if they receive funding, directly or indirectly, from foreign governments or corporations. The government would have the authority to revoke the non-profit status of organizations that violate the prohibition. 
“This proposal could effectively prevent Mexican human rights defenders from participating in debates about public policy, challenging abusive laws in the courts, or discussing how to improve rights protections with lawmakers,” said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, acting Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “This is the kind of attempt to expand executive power at the expense of fundamental freedoms we have seen from autocratic leaders in countries ranging from Russia, to Nicaragua, to El Salvador.”  
“Civil society organizations and human rights defenders who speak out against unjust laws and government practices, challenge those in power, and demand justice are being increasingly targeted across the region,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. “For decades, civil society organizations have played a key role in advancing human rights in Mexico by pushing Congress for legislative changes and by challenging abusive laws in the courts. The proposed bill reflects the broader political trend in which toxic narratives demonize NGOs with the intention to silence critical views and inhibit the ability of human rights defenders to scrutinize state institutions.” 
President López Obrador regularly attacks human rights, environmental, and transparency groups. He often publicly singles out specific people and organizations in his morning news conferences, baselessly accusing them of being part of an opposition plot to overthrow his government. He has also said that international donors and aid agencies should stop funding Mexican civil society groups out of respect for “non-interventionism.” 
The proposed bill reflects the broader political trend in which toxic narratives demonize NGOs with the intention to silence critical views and inhibit the ability of human rights defenders to scrutinize state institutions. 
Mexican groups have spoken out publicly against projects and proposals promoted by López Obrador and his party that raise human rights concerns. Notable examples include a bill that would have effectively legalized arbitrary detention and allowed the use of evidence obtained through torture, and a railway project that opponents say would harm the environment and Indigenous communities. In some cases, groups have taken legal action to halt or delay these initiatives. 
The introduction to the new bill, which outlines its motives, recognizes that civil society groups have impeded or blocked some government proposals and accuses those who have done so of “coup plotting,” “interventionism,” and “violat[ing] our national sovereignty.” 
“This is the kind of attempt to expand executive power at the expense of fundamental freedoms we have seen from autocratic leaders in countries ranging from Russia, to Nicaragua, to El Salvador. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented how other governments have used similar laws to arbitrarily restrict the activity of civil society groups. 
In Nicaragua, the government has cancelled the registration of dozens of human rights and aid organizations, such as Oxfam, using a law requiring any organization that received foreign funding to register as a “foreign agent” and then prohibiting them from interfering in “internal politics.” 
In Ecuador, during Rafael Correa’s presidency, the government issued a decree giving it broad powers to regulate or dissolve civil society groups accused of “political interference.” It used these powers to expel a number of international organizations and dissolve an Ecuadorian environmental group after some of its members protested oil drilling in the Amazon. 
In Venezuela, the government has passed a series of laws restricting the activities of civil society and has criminally prosecuted groups that receive foreign funding, accusing them of “treason” and “crimes against national sovereignty.” 
In Guatemala, a law came into effect in June 2021 empowering the government to arbitrarily shutter any civil society group it considers to have violated public order. 
In El Salvador, the government proposed a “foreign agents” law in November 2021 that would have barred groups receiving international funding from “political activities.” After objections from human rights groups, the law did not move forward, but remains pending. 
Outside of Latin America and the Caribbean, authorities in places like Russia, Egypt, and China have passed draconian laws to restrict the work of human rights defenders and, in some cases, have prosecuted and fined human rights groups for engaging in “political activity.” 
Since taking office in 2018, President López Obrador has eliminated the independent funding that supported the program that protects journalists and human rights defenders whose lives have been threatened. He has also vilified and intimidated independent journalists, publicly accusing them of lying, calling them “criminals,” and publicly sharing sensitive personal information about a journalist critical of him. 
He has attempted to weaponize the justice system against his opponents, pushing for a reform to assert control over the courts, holding a referendum on whether to put former opposition party presidents on trial, and calling for a judge who ruled against him to be investigated. And he has attempted to neutralize or proposed eliminating independent institutions that serve as checks on presidential power, such as the independent access to information agency. 
Under international law, as part of their duty to protect and promote human rights, governments must ensure that human rights defenders are allowed to pursue their activities without reprisals, threats, intimidation, harassment, discrimination, or unnecessary legal obstacles. Both the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have recognized that this includes allowing human rights organizations to solicit, receive, and use funding from foreign governmental and non-governmental organizations and to benefit from tax exemptions available to other non-profit organizations. 
The UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders recognizes that human rights defenders have the right to propose legal and policy changes, to provide legal representation in defense of human rights, and to make formal complaints to government bodies and have those complaints reviewed.

0,I survived imprisonment in Burundi,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/i-survived-imprisonment-in-burundi/,"And what I saw on the inside has made me that much more determined to fight for human rights in my country. In July 2017, my wife Emelyne Mupfasoni and I were woken up by dozens of heavily armed members of the security forces who stormed our home in Burundi. Emelyne was five months away […]","In July 2017, my wife Emelyne Mupfasoni and I were woken up by dozens of heavily armed members of the security forces who stormed our home in Burundi. Emelyne was five months away from giving birth to our third child. The officers searched our house, seized my wife’s laptop, drove me to my office to search there too, and seized my laptop and other items. They then took me to the cells of the National Intelligence Service where I was held in custody for two weeks. I was kept in inhuman conditions in the National Intelligence Service cell in Bujumbura before being transferred to Ngozi prison in northern Burundi. 
My arrest came as no surprise. Human rights defenders, young people and political opponents from Burundi who called for the respect of the law have been targeted as criminals since 2015. In April of that year, then-President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his decision to stand for a third term in office – a move widely considered to be in breach of the country’s constitution. As many Burundians voiced their rejection of this move in street demonstrations, the government launched a wave of repression across the country. 
As a result, civil society organisations, which were at the forefront of protests against Nkurunziza, came under relentless attack. Many human rights defenders, opposition leaders and journalists were forced to leave Burundi and many of those who have remained faced threats and reprisals, including arrest, prosecution on trumped-up charges, and enforced disappearance. The situation has led to more than 400,000 Burundians fleeing into exile in neighbouring countries. 
My work also did not go unnoticed. I had already narrowly escaped arrest and kidnapping on several occasions. When I was arrested, having seen the many who had lost their lives before me and others who had gone missing under similar conditions, I immediately thought that my life was coming to an end and the countdown had begun. 
I was accused of a slew of sham charges, including “rebellion”, “destruction and degradation of private and public buildings”, “attack against the authority of the state”, “participation in the insurrectionary movement” and “threatening state security”. My previous work with Action by Christians for Abolition of Torture (ACAT Burundi) was used against me. 
I have always been passionate about improving the world, saving lives and transforming the space where I live. I hate injustice and I do not like to see other people in pain. That is why I joined ACAT Burundi in 2004. From 2006 to 2010, I was part of the ACAT volunteer team that visited detention facilities across the country, before becoming the organisation’s head of finance and administration in 2011. I then went to work for the Association of Catholic Jurists of Burundi (AJCB) until I was arrested. 
I was sentenced to 32 years in prison simply for defending human rights. Being imprisoned was incredibly hard. I was harassed and persecuted. Everything in prison was done with the intention of making me suffer, making me depressed, discouraging me and silencing other committed human rights defenders. 
I had spent nearly a decade visiting prisons and I thought I knew what it was like to be inside – but I was wrong. I learned what prison was really like when I was detained and I knew that when I was eventually released, I would use this information to educate people about Burundi’s prison system. 
In Burundi, prisons have lost their meaning – they are no longer correctional facilities. Instead, prisons have become places that confine people like me – political opponents, those who have dared express their opinions, and other innocent people. If your views bother certain authorities, you are in trouble. 
While in prison, I found strength and resilience in my innocence. I knew that, sooner or later, the truth would come out. I was not the first person to be wrongfully arrested, nor was I the first person to suffer that kind of injustice and persecution. My case revealed everything that had been done anonymously to previous victims. 
Knowing I was imprisoned for a good cause, for defending human rights, was comforting. My case was made widely known to the Burundian people and within the international community, and I knew that would help me and subsequent victims. In a way, I felt as though being put in prison was better than being kidnapped as I could still live in hope that I would one day regain my freedom and my family. 
I was eventually released in June 2021 and I was overjoyed. The first thing I did was contact my family, my former colleagues and my friends. I could not wait to see my family again, including my sons, the youngest of whom I had never met as he was born four months after my arrest. They give me such a sense of pride. 
I am so grateful for the support I received from human rights organisations during my arbitrary detention and since my release from prison. Being part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign was incredible and the waves of messages and letters from its supporters around the world gave me strength and courage and reinforced my commitment to defending human rights. 
 Being part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign was incredible and the waves of messages and letters from its supporters around the world gave me strength and courage and reinforced my commitment to defending human rights.  
As for all the people who campaigned on my behalf while I was in prison, thank you. To all the supporters from Amnesty International who took more than 436,292 actions on my case, thank you for all the support you have shown me since 20 November 2020 [launch of Write for Rights 2020], which also happens to be the birthday of my youngest, born four months after my arrest. I encourage you to support other victims of injustice and I want you to tell other people that Write for Rights really does have a positive impact. Your support has made me come out of prison even more committed to defending human rights. 
Despite my release, the human rights situation in Burundi remains alarming and my country still has a long way to go. In May 2020, a new president was elected but hopes for a major change in the status quo have diminished. 
At his inauguration last year, President Evariste Ndayishimiye declared his intention “to build Burundi on solid foundations, namely: good governance, respect and protection of human rights”. However, he quickly went on to dismiss some human rights defenders as “puppets of the colonists”. 
Despite some overtures by the president towards the media in 2021, his government continues to view human rights work with suspicion, and severe restrictions on human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, remain in place. 
According to various reports, there have also been numerous enforced disappearances, which the president and various other authorities continue to ignore, while rates of violence against women, abductions and assassinations remain high. The Burundian authorities have forgotten the struggle they experienced before coming to power and now they are doing nothing to guarantee stability and a future for our children. This needs to change, otherwise, it is the young generations who will suffer. 
Being imprisoned helped me identify the flaws that plague the world, and it has made me determined to find positive and lasting solutions so we can all enjoy our rights and freedoms. Since my release, I have founded the organisation Together for the Support of Human Rights Defenders in Danger (ESDDH). 
As a victim and survivor, I know how much journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and other people like them deserve support for their work. To people experiencing political persecution, I want to say: Stay strong and resilient, it will end one day and you too will be able to regain your freedom and your families. 
Germain Rukuki is a human rights defender and founder of the organization Together for the Support of Human Rights Defenders in Danger (ESDDH). He previously worked for Action by Christians for Abolition of Torture (ACAT Burundi) and Association of Catholic Jurists of Burundi (AJCB).  
During Amnesty International’s global Write for Rights 2020 campaign, supporters from around the world took more than 436,000 actions calling for Germain’s freedom, including nearly 10,000 actions from Canada.

In June 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls issued its final report, including 231 Calls for Justice. 
Two years later, in June 2021, the federal government released a National Action Plan aimed at transforming the Calls for Justice into concrete actions. The plan lacks detailed implementation plans, timelines, and accountability measures. Action is still needed to encourage government to take concrete action to end the violence, and solidarity is needed with Indigenous activists who have worked tirelessly, in some cases for decades, to ensure justice for their stolen sisters. 
Annually on October 4th, hundreds of Sisters in Spirit vigils are held in communities across Canada to honour Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people who have gone missing or been murdered, and every year Amnesty members participate in these vigils. 
Last year, many vigils were cancelled or moved online to comply with public health guidelines. With the uncertainty of the fourth wave of the pandemic, it is unclear whether local vigil organizers will opt for in-person or virtual vigils. Thank you for complying with public health guidelines on in person gatherings. Whether it’s in person or online, please take time on October 4th to take action to end violence against First Nations, Métis, and Inuit women, girls, and two-spirit people. 
Read the No More Stolen Sisters Campaign Guide, released in March 2021. The guide focuses on how you can support Indigenous-led local activism to end violence against First Nations, Métis, and Inuit women, girls, and two-spirit people, and is particularly relevant as you consider how to support and participate in October 4 vigils. 
Have you read the guide and begun implementing its suggestions on how to support Indigenous-led local activism? Please take five minutes to complete this survey on actions you have taken to implement the guide. Survey participants will be entered in a draw to win hand beaded earrings made by grassroots advocate Bridget Tolley and a face mask from Indigenous Face Masks.

The organization’s new policy briefing offers a damning assessment of global failures to protect human rights from climate change, and outlines how human rights law can help hold governments and companies to account.   
Ahead of the G7 Leaders’ Summit (11-13 June), Amnesty highlighted how G7 members are still subsidizing the coal, oil and gas industry, and have no credible plans to begin significantly phasing out all fossil fuels during this decade. All G7 members have committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but none has submitted an adequate strategy to reduce emissions by 2030 – the year by which global emissions need to be halved in order to avert the worst-case climate scenarios.   
“The unambitious climate plans submitted by G7 members represent a violation of the human rights of billions of people. These are not administrative failures, they are a devastating, mass-scale assault on human rights,” said Chiara Liguori, Amnesty International’s Human Rights and Environment Policy Advisor.  
“The G7 and other wealthy industrialized countries have historically emitted the most carbon and bear the greatest responsibility for the current climate crisis. They also have the most resources to tackle it – but their strategies to date have been woefully inadequate, and their support for other countries has been stingy.  
“At the G7 Leaders’ Summit, governments must commit to unconditionally phasing out all fossil fuels, as close to 2030 as is technically feasible. They must put in place tough regulations requiring businesses to shift to renewable energy, and stop using our taxes to subsidize the deadly fossil fuel industry.”  
Amnesty International is calling on all governments to adopt and implement ambitious national climate plans which reflect their individual levels of responsibility and capacity. Wealthy industrialized countries, including all G7 members, must reach zero carbon emissions as close to 2030 as possible. Middle-income countries with greater capacity, such as China and South Africa, must aim to halve emissions by 2030 or as soon as possible after that, and to reach zero by 2050. Other middle and low-income countries must aim to reach zero by 2050.    
All states must also ensure a just transition for workers and communities affected by climate change and the decarbonization process, taking steps to reduce poverty and correct existing inequalities in the enjoyment of human rights.  This includes prioritizing investment in responsibly produced renewable energy and social protection, whilst supporting the creation of new, green and decent jobs.  
Burning our rights  
Amnesty International’s new policy briefing, Stop Burning Our Rights! provides an extensive legal and ethical blueprint for what states and corporations must do to address the climate crisis, help affected people adapt, and ensure remedy for the harm they have caused. It shows how human rights law can guide governments, companies, and activists in the battle against the climate crisis. Around the world, human rights law is increasingly being used to hold governments and companies accountable for their failures to address climate change.  
Download the executive summary of Amnesty International’s new policy briefing, Stop Burning Our Rights!  
Under international human rights law, all states must do everything in their power to reduce emissions as quickly as possible, but Amnesty’s briefing contains numerous examples of governments failing in this obligation.  
For example, of the G20 countries, which collectively account for almost 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, just seven have submitted targets to reduce emissions by 2030 to the UN. All of these are currently insufficient to keep the temperature increase below 1.5 degrees.  
In fact, support for the fossil fuel industry has continued almost unabated since the Paris Agreement came into force. During the pandemic, many G20 countries provided unconditional economic stimulus measures to fossil fuel and aviation companies – despite knowing full well that subsidizing these industries will harm millions of people.  
Wealthier states have an obligation to assist lower-income countries, including by providing adequate finance to support the shift to renewable energy, help protect people from climate harms, and to remedy loss and damage. Here too they have failed. So far, at least three quarters of international climate finance has been provided as loans rather than grants. This means lower-income countries have to use their own resources to cover climate-related costs imposed on them by others, contravening obligations on international assistance.   
Just transition  
Amnesty International’s briefing also emphasizes the importance of a just transition that protects human rights. It warns that too many governments are trying to take shortcuts that will exacerbate inequality, relying excessively on unproven technologies or carbon trading mechanisms, some of which can themselves have a catastrophic impact on human rights. For example, large-scale biofuel crop farms to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and conservation projects in Global South countries to offset emissions of wealthier countries can affect food security, livelihoods and access to land of millions of people.   
Decarbonizing the economy is crucial, but without adequate human rights safeguards, mitigation measures risk causing further harm to groups already facing discrimination and marginalization. In addition, most technologies are not currently able to produce substantive negative emissions, and relying on their future development is a dangerous bet.  
“Disadvantaged groups must not pay the price for the inaction of wealthy governments and their connivance with the fossil fuel industry,” said Chiara Liguori.  
“There are no shortcuts to saving the planet and humanity. The only option is to rapidly end the fossil fuel era. We can have human rights or fossil fuels – we can’t have both.”

In 2019, Canada created the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, but failed to give the ombudsperson the powers needed to conduct effective investigations into human rights abuses involving Canadian companies. Amnesty continues to press the government to give the Ombudsperson the power to compel documents and testimony.  
While having an Ombudsperson that can conduct effective investigations is important to help ensure that people harmed by Canadian companies overseas have access to remedy, it is not enough to ensure corporate accountability. Amnesty Canada and the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability are also calling on the Canadian government to adopt a law requiring Canadian companies (and companies selling products in Canada) to: identify human rights risks in their global supply chains; prevent human rights abuses; immediately stop directly or indirectly contributing to human rights abuses; and ensure remedy for people who have been harmed. This is called “human rights due diligence” legislation. 
The last several years have seen a growth in global momentum toward mandatory human rights due diligence requirements for companies. The European Commission and a number of European countries already require, or are in the process of developing laws that would require, companies within their jurisdictions to conduct human rights due diligence throughout their global operations. It is time Canada catches up and enacts legislation that holds corporations accountable for their actions!

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted LGBTI people. People have been forced into lockdown with homophobic and transphobic family members. Some governments have used the pandemic as an excuse to crackdown on a whole range of human rights, including LGBTI rights. LGBTI human rights defenders are at a heightened risk of persecution. Connecting in person with chosen family, communities of care, and other supports has often been impossible. And now, the pandemic is forcing Pride activities online for the second straight year. The need for virtual communities of care and solidarity, and global activism in support of LGBTI rights has never been greater! Join us during Pride season to take action in support of LGBTI rights! 
Queer liberation cannot be separated from the liberation of Black, Indigenous and other people of colour. Wondering what has Pride got to do with police violence and racism? Learn more in this blog by Amnesty’s Daniella Barreto!

The federal government must drop the appeal! Your voice is needed to let our Members of Parliament know that our communities include refugees and we care about refugee rights.  
This legal challenge dates back to July 2017, when Amnesty International, the Canadian Council of Refugees and the Canadian Council of Churches sought to challenge the STCA’s constitutionality as public interest parties, alongside refugee protection claimants from Ethiopia, Syria and El Salvador. All of the claimants had been denied entry into Canada and returned to the US because of the STCA. 
Under the STCA, refugee claimants must claim protection in the first country in which they arrive in most cases. The agreement assumes the US is a ‘safe’ country which upholds international human rights and the Refugee Convention. 
Following extensive written submissions and five days of oral argument in November 2019, Justice Ann Marie McDonald rendered a decision on 22 July 2020, finding that the Canadian law implementing the STCA violates s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects the right to life, liberty and security of the person. She determined that those who are returned to the US face arbitrary immigration detention in conditions that “shock the conscience.” She also found that STCA returnees face an increased risk of being sent back to their countries of origin by American authorities, where they may face persecution. 
In spite of the finding of clear human rights violations by the Federal Court, the government has launched an appeal. Although a date for the case has not yet been set, it is likely to take place in February or March 2021. If it takes place virtually, it may be possible to view a video stream of the hearing online. 
Many organizations are now seeking to intervene in this case. They include: Rainbow Refugee, Rainbow Railroad, Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the National Council of Canadian Muslims, the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, the David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights, the Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund, the West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund, the HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario, the HIV Legal Network, the Committee for Accessible AIDS Treatment, and the Health Justice Program. This demonstrates how important this case is to a diverse set of civil society, legal, and human rights organizations.

A year ago, monitoring the G7 protests in Biarritz, I was kettled for more than two hours by police under a baking sun. The following day, I was almost choked by tear gas in Bayonne. What I experienced in the southwest of France was part of a heavy-handed police and judicial response to peaceful protest that is being that is being increasingly rolled out across many parts of Europe. 
By any standards, 2019 was a remarkable year for protest. Mass movements demanding social, economic and climate justice swept the streets of Paris, London, Brussels and scores of other cities. Some states, like France, responded with rubber bullets and tear gas grenades often used illegitimately against protesters. New legislation to fine, arrest and prosecute people for simply expressing their opinions was introduced. And yet, despite these measures it seemed that protesters were becoming more emboldened to make their voices heard. 
But then came the COVID-19 pandemic and with it, many of the rights that we take for granted – such as the right to protest – were necessarily restricted. But if we look carefully at both 2019 and 2020, we see a disturbing common thread. European authorities not only have cracked down on protests in 2019. They have also used the pandemic in 2020 as a smokescreen for pursuing a pattern of silencing dissent. 
A report published today by Amnesty International finds that a blanket ban on protests following the COVID-19 -lockdown in France, was disproportionate and resulted in hundreds of unjustified fines. But the restrictions on protests since lockdown measures were lifted in France are merely a continuation of a disturbing pattern that has seen peaceful protesters under assault from the police and the justice system. Thousands of peaceful protesters have been swept up in France’s draconian crackdown on demonstrations, which has seen the authorities weaponize the law to fine, arbitrarily arrest and prosecute protesters violence and have otherwise respected public health measures. 
In 2019 alone French courts convicted more than 21,000 people for offences such as contempt of public officials and organization of a protest without complying with notification requirements. These behaviours should never be criminalized. 
The crackdown is not unique to France. And neither is the use of the pandemic as a carte blanche to suppress protests. 
In the United Kingdom, the Metropolitan police imposed last October a blanket ban against Extinction Rebellion protests, which was later found to be disproportionate by the High Court. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and prosecuted while the ban was in place. 
Extinction Rebellion activists also felt the heavy hand of policing in Brussels in October 2019. The police used force unlawfully and more than 500 protesters were arrested and many more placed in administrative detention. 
Last year, peaceful protesters were also kettled, injured and arrested in Austria, Greece, Spain and many more European countries. 
COVID-19 is not only disrupting our lives but it is also fundamentally changing the context in which people can legitimately express dissent by participating in collective actions. 
Countering the pandemic can rightfully justify restrictions on human rights, including the right to peaceful assembly. In a context of lockdown when businesses are closed and freedom of movement is restricted, to curb the spread of a highly contagious disease, it is reasonable for governments to inhibit gatherings, including protests. But this should not give carte blanche to governments to enact excessive and disproportionate restrictions without necessary assessments and justifications. 
Blanket bans on protests are rarely justifiable, in particular when other lockdown measures that allow people to gather have been eased. In France for example, the government kept a ban on protests attended by more than ten people but allowed larger gatherings to go ahead on public transport and places open to the public. It was clear that the government’s intention was to silence protesters, not to protect public health. As a result, dozens of protesters were fined. 
High courts in France and Germany struck down similar blanket bans, finding that authorities had acted unlawfully. 
This also summer saw heavy handed policing of Black Lives Matter protests around Europe, with protesters in London being charged with horses and kettled. 
In Poland, law enforcement officials have used the pandemic as an excuse to fine protesters even when they were complying with public health restrictions, like wearing facial coverings and keeping physical distance. 
European authorities have an arsenal of weapons at their disposal to crack down on protests. European police forces often carry dangerous weapons such as rubber bullets and tear gas grenades, and prosecutors and courts use of vague laws to silence peaceful dissent. 
Speaking one’s mind, critically challenging government decisions and protesting peacefully are a vital part of a healthy free society. They offer an outlet to express hopes for the future and demand a better world. 
Nobody should be brutalised or bullied into feeling afraid to protest. 
In pre-pandemic times, the arrests and prosecutions of peaceful protesters had a chilling effect on many activists. The danger is that with COVID-19 here to stay many European countries will continue to use the pandemic as a moment to further chip away rights and stifle dissent.

One fundamental truth is beyond any doubt: they have done nothing wrong. 
What have they done? 
They have done nothing wrong. They stood up for human rights in Turkey.  
The 11 – that includes the former chair, ex-director and several members of Amnesty Turkey as well as women’s and equality advocates – face absurd ‘terrorism’ charges without any credible evidence being presented over the course of ten hearings. 
Since their detention in 2017, more than two million people around the world – from Ai Wei Wei to Whoopi Goldberg – have spoken out for justice for the 11 rights defenders. Now as this unfair trial is coming to a close, we are asking you to join us in adding your voice and send a message of solidarity to the 11 activists ahead of the verdict. 
After all, when people who defend our rights are silenced, we are all at risk. 
When were they arrested and what are they accused of? 
Taner Kılıç, then chair of Amnesty Turkey, was arrested at his home in Izmir in the early hours of 6 June 2017. Three days later he was remanded in prison custody on charges of being a member of what the government call the “Fethullah Gülen Terrorist Organization” that they accuse being the masterminds of the 2016 violent coup attempt. Without any evidence, the authorities claimed that Taner had downloaded “ByLock”, a secure messaging application the government says was used by the group to communicate. 
Nearly a month later, on 5 July, ten human rights defenders (the ‘Istanbul 10’) were detained from a hotel on the island of Büyükada in Istanbul where they were taking part in a workshop on wellbeing and digital security. The authorities accused them of taking part in a secret meeting. Eight of the ten defenders were remanded in prison on the basis of these allegations. 
İdil Eser, Günal Kurşun, Özlem Dalkıran, Veli Acu, Ali Gharavi, Peter Steudtner, Nalan Erkem and İlknur Üstün spent 99 days in pre-trial detention before they were released on bail at the first hearing in the case on 25 October 2017 in Istanbul. 
The court also requested that Taner’s prosecution be transferred to Istanbul and be merged with that of the Istanbul 10, alleging that Taner had directed the “secret Büyükada meeting” even though he had been in prison at the time it took place.  At Taner’s first hearing in Izmir which took place the next day on 26 October, the court accepted the Istanbul court’s request for the transfer, merging the two separate prosecutions into one single case in Istanbul. The court also ruled to continue Taner’s pre-trial detention. The case has since been dubbed the ‘Büyükada trial’. 
The prosecutor added information and documents found on computers seized from the Istanbul 10 showing the legitimate human rights activism. These included: a campaign to stop the sale of tear gas to Turkey along with other Amnesty International documents, making a grant application for a human rights project, and campaigning for the release from detention of hunger-striking teachers. 
Amnesty International has compiled a detailed analysis of the indictment, addressing each of the allegations made against the 11 defendants. Learn more about the defendants here. 
Latest hearing 
At the ninth hearing in November 2019, the state prosecutor presented his final opinion requesting convictions against Taner Kılıç for “membership of a terrorist organization”, Idil Eser, Özlem Dalkıran, Günal Kurşun, Veli Acu and Nejat Taştan for “knowingly and willingly assisting a terrorist organization”. He requested that the court acquits Nalan Erkem, İlknur Üstün, Şeyhmus Özbekli, Ali Gharavi and Peter Steudtner. 
The prosecutor’s summing up reads like a copy of the indictment reproducing the baseless allegations – that were proven to be false throughout the various hearings – as if the whole trial had not taken place. 
We expected a verdict at the following hearing on 19 February, but the defence statements could not be concluded in the time provided by the court. The trial was first postponed until 3 April 2020, and now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, until 3 July 2020 when the verdict is expected. 
What is likely to happen next, at the final hearing? 
During the course of the trial, the state prosecution did not prove its case against the 11 human rights defenders. For justice to be done, all 11 must be acquitted. They should never have been investigated, let alone imprisoned or prosecuted. 
On 3 July 2020, the court may decide to ignore the prosecutor’s request for convictions and acquit all. Equally, the prosecutor’s request for five of the defenders to be acquitted is also no guarantee they will be acquitted. All 11 remain at risk of conviction and imprisonment. 
If any of the 11 human rights defenders are convicted, even if they don’t go back to prison because of the time spend in pre-trial detention, this would be a huge blow to the individuals, and to independent civil society in Turkey. 
Four of the 11 defenders are lawyers. Should they be convicted, and their convictions confirmed on appeal, they would lose their licence and would no longer be able to practice law. 
Whatever the verdict, it is likely to be appealed and risks will continue until all of them are acquitted by the appeal court, which may issue a judgment years after the first instance court’s decision. 
Sample tweets: 
Almost three years on there is still no evidence of any wrongdoing by the 11 HRDs in the Büyükada trial. They must be acquitted without further delay. #FreeRightsDefenders 
The 11 HRDs facing outrageous charges despite having done nothing wrong. We won’t stop saying #FreeRightsDefenders until they’re acquitted and prosecutions of all those defending human rights are stopped. 
 
Standing in solidarity with human rights defenders 
The case has echoed across the world, with international support pouring in for the 11 human rights defenders. Over 2,000,000 people signed the petition for their release from prison and for the absurd charges against them to be dropped. 
Governments, institutions and political representatives from around the world as well as numerous artists and celebrities including Zoë Kravitz, Ben Stiller, Mark Ruffalo, Whoopi Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Annie Lennox, Bono, Peter Gabriel, Juliette Binoche, Jane Birkin, Angélique Kidjo, Patrick Stewart, Sting, Catherine Deneuve and Ai Weiwei appealed for the release of the defenders when they were held in pre-trial detention, and called for the absurd charges to be dropped.

In light of the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, and the particular threat that it poses to vulnerable communities with inadequate access to health care, housing, water and other essential services, it is imperative that federal, provincial and territorial governments respect the right of Indigenous peoples to set conditions of entry into their territories.

Different communities face different threats and challenges and they are developing effective solutions based on the needs of the people and the resources at hand. Many are in need of better healthcare equipment and services, many have concerns about over-crowded housing, while people are checking-in with elders, sharing food and traditional medicines, and creating emergency plans.   
Amnesty will be featuring different communities, their worries, and the solutions they have developed in the face of COVID-19. We will also connect activists with opportunities to advocate for Indigenous rights to ensure that everyone gets the help they need during the pandemic.  
We begin with an introduction to Kelly Lake Cree Nation, a community of 800 people on the border between northern British Columbia and Alberta.  
As’in’i’wa’chi Ni’yaw Nation, also known as Kelly Lake Cree Nation, has more than 800 members in present-day northeastern British Columbia and western central Alberta and has been fighting for the past 20 years to prove its existence as an independent Indigenous community. 
In this video, Chief Calliou speaks in English and Cree about his concerns and efforts in regards to protecting his community from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
COVID-19 response challenges 
The people of Kelly Lake Cree are descendants of the Nêhiyaw and Dane-zaa nations who hold inherent right to their territories, some 40,000 square km, and of the Rotinonhsesháka trappers and traders who came to the region with the North West Company in the 18th century. Today, the people of Kelly Lake proudly identify as Cree people, speak the Woods Cree dialect, participate in Cree cultural traditions, and retain and respect Cree knowledge and beliefs relating to territory and community life. 
The As’in’i’wa’chi Ni’yaw Nation is one of the few in the Peace River area who have not been included in the treaty process. As a result, unlike neighbouring Indigenous communities who signed onto Treaty 8, the nation remained outside treaty and maintained self-sufficiency. 
In 1996, Kelly Lake Cree Nation filed a comprehensive land claim against the Government of Canada, and a civil claim against the Province of British Columbia in 2010. Claims such as these are modern treaties signed between Indigenous peoples and governments. They are based on traditional land use and occupation by Indigenous peoples who have not signed treaties, or have not been forced from their territories by war or other means. Such claims, which are settled through a negotiation process, ensure that the federal government recognizes the Indigenous community and obliges government to respect their rights as an Indigenous people. Since the Daniels decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 2016, the federal government also has legal responsibilities to non-status Indigenous people in Canada. 
The people of As’in’i’wa’chi Ni’yaw Nation affirm: 
Our people never placed boundaries over the territory, elders tell us,  
“you know you’re still within our lands when you hear our Cree language being spoken, when it becomes no more, than you know you’re out of our territory.” 
Our people have a vision, and despite the continual infringements upon our rights, we have never surrendered the Indigenous rights and title to our lands. 
Amnesty will be connecting activists with opportunities to advocate for Indigenous rights in response to calls from Indigenous communities.  
Advocate for the federal government to respect Indigenous rights and ensure every community has the resources they need.

BACKGROUND 
 
The 2014 Mount Polley mine disaster in British Columbia’s Cariboo region, also known as Secwepemeculecw, was a devastating reminder of what can go wrong when governments fail to suitably regulate companies. The copper mine’s tailings pond collapse led to the destruction of Hazeltine Creek – a fish-bearing creek – and contamination of the western basin of Quesnel Lake. Remediation efforts did not remove toxic tailings sediment from the lake, leading locals to fear for their health and that of the fish and aquatic life in the lake. Scientists at the University of Northern British Columbia have reported on changes to the wester basin waters since the disaster.   
In 2017, to compound matters and frustrate locals who opposed it, the province issued the company a permit to pipe untreated, filtered mine wastewater into Quesnel Lake until 2022. Residents and Indigenous peoples have been fighting to have the discharge pipes removed from Quesnel Lake and for the Province to compel the company to implement on-site wastewater treatment.  
 
Video created by Dogwood for the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake, 2019 
Two United Nations bodies, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights and the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, have since highlighted the Mount Polley mine disaster and called on Canada to bring those responsible for the disaster to justice and provide remedy to those who were harmed.  
Shockingly, despite these recommendations and a criminal investigation lasting four years, the government of Canada has not taken legal action.

Braving arrest, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets, they have marched day after day to claim their rights.
On 4 September, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced her government’s formal withdrawal of the Extradition Bill that had sparked the protests. But this was only one of the “five demands” that have propelled the movement.
Protesters also want the government to retract its characterization of protests as “riots”; an independent investigation into use of force by police; and the unconditional release of everyone arrested in the context of protests. They also want political reform to ensure genuine universal suffrage – the ability to choose Hong Kong’s leaders themselves – as set under the city’s mini-Constitution, the Basic Law.
Here three students tell Amnesty International why they’re not backing down now.
Joey
My name is Joey Siu, and I’m vice president of my university student union. I had planned to spend the summer holiday with my grandma, because when school starts I don’t get to see her much. I also had some plans to travel – the usual things that university students do on their break.
Instead, I protested all summer. I think it’s our responsibility as students to play a part in social movements. People who have the time and resources to protest have an obligation to safeguard Hong Kong’s core values of human rights and democracy.
The police response has been horrible. The first time I experienced tear gas was on 12 June. It was a very, very bad day. I was trying to distribute protective gear to protesters when tear gas was suddenly deployed at our first aid station. Tears poured uncontrollably from my eyes and I could hardly breathe. Other people have been beaten up by the police just for taking part in protests. This is why there needs to be an independent investigation into police actions, and one of the reasons why we aren’t backing down. 
People in Hong Kong are really angry – we feel like there is no way back, so we must keep fighting. Although the government has now withdrawn the Extradition Bill, this was just one of our five demands, and we’ve still had no response to the others.
Most of my family didn’t know about my role in the movement until they saw me at a press conference on TV. They are so worried about me, so I don’t always tell them what I’m doing. When my parents saw the violence committed by the police they asked me to stop going to protests – but of course, I couldn’t do that.
I have no idea how these protests will end, or even what will happen tomorrow. We can only hope for the best, be water – and respect our fellow citizens.
Mickey
My name is Mickey. I am 17 years old and I’m in my last year of secondary school.
I never imagined I’d see 1 million people marching together – it’s been really eye opening. I may not be protesting at the very front, but I am always there to show my support. I’m also taking part in the boycott of classes, which I hope can put more pressure on the government.
Although Carrie Lam promised to withdraw the Extradition Bill, we will keep protesting and striking until the rest of our demands are met. This movement has grown into something much bigger than one bill, and the way police reacted to the protests has underscored the need for things to change.
The first time I witnessed protesters being beaten by the police was the night we occupied the entrance of the Legislative Council. My heart still beats really fast whenever I see the police running towards us. Sometimes I’m afraid that I’ll be arrested but I’m not going to stop now. People in Hong Kong are really angry, and the best thing we can do with this anger is to keep protesting.
Suki
My name is Suki and I study nursing at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. As well as marching at protests, I’ve been providing first aid to people injured by tear gas.
I will never forget one 15-year-old student who was barely able to breathe after inhaling tear gas. After a short break, he put on his gear and told us he had to go back to the front line.
I took part in the Umbrella Movement in 2014, and I occasionally went to vigils commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown, but I had never participated in a march. But when the government announced its plans for the Extradition Bill, I realized that in future I might lose the freedoms of assembly and expression I had been taking for granted. So, on 9 June, I took to the streets for the first time – accompanied by 1 million other people.
A few days later I joined my friends at a peaceful rally. I was very surprised that so many people came out again, but everyone felt helpless because the government wasn’t listening to our demands. But on 16 June, 2 million people came out to march. I decided I would keep going to the demonstrations and use my nursing knowledge to provide first aid to people who had been injured. Many people ask how these protests will end, and the truth is we don’t know. All I know is we have to keep going. The withdrawal of the Extradition Bill isn’t enough – this movement has shown how many Hong Kongers want fundamental changes. Our human rights are under threat, and we must stick together to stand up for them.
Amnesty international has called for the full withdrawal of the Extradition Bill, and for a prompt, effective, impartial and independent investigation into the unnecessary and excessive use of force in the policing of the protests.

“Every year governments attend and host international trade fairs where they can browse stalls selling horrifying torture devices – this secretive trade has gone unregulated for far too long. Torturers around the world have benefited from loose regulations which allow them to access all the latest technologies in inflicting pain and fear,” said Ara Marcen Naval, Deputy Director for Arms Control and Human Rights at Amnesty International.
Adopting the resolution would be a first step towards creating international laws to ban the trade in equipment which has no other purpose than torture. It would also be a chance to tighten regulations on equipment like batons and tear gas, which are regularly misused to crush peaceful protests. 
“It’s time for states to send a clear message that they are committed to eradicating torture for good. We are calling on governments to adopt this resolution, and then work towards adopting regulations that will curb this business and protect people all over the world from the scourge of torture and ill-treatment,” said Ara Marcen Naval.
As well as calling for inherently abusive equipment to be banned, Amnesty is calling for states to strictly regulate the export of policing equipment to stop transfers to countries where it risks being used for torture, ill-treatment or other abuses.
The tools of torture
‘Tools of torture’ refers to a wide range of security and law enforcement equipment which could be used to torture, ill-treat or execute people. Amnesty International has documented how China is a major player in this industry, and found that the number of Chinese companies manufacturing his equipment has more than quadrupled in the past decade.
However, the use of tools of torture has been documented in all regions of the world, and many countries which ban their use still allow them to be promoted and sold on their soil. For example, in 2017, Amnesty researchers discovered illegal torture equipment including spiked batons, spiked electric shock riot forks, electric shock vests and heavy leg irons for sale by Chinese companies at Milipol, a military and police trade fair in Paris.
Domestic export bans on torture and execution equipment in many countries have restricted the torture trade in recent years; and in 2006 the EU introduced a regulation concerning the “trade in goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. But no international regulation exists, which means that outside the EU torture tools are being manufactured, promoted, exported and imported with little global scrutiny.
In order to be fully effective, any legislation aiming to tackle this trade should distinguish between two types of equipment. It should ban inherently abusive equipment (such as spiked batons, neck cuffs, electric shock belts) while regulating equipment which may have a legitimate purpose but which is commonly abused for torture or other ill-treatment (such as tear gas and pepper spray).
Amnesty International has repeatedly documented how common law enforcement equipment can be used to torture or otherwise ill-treat people. For example, in the past month alone, law enforcement authorities in Hong Kong and Sudan have used tear gas against peaceful protestors in an excessive and abusive manner, often causing serious injury.
Amnesty International is calling on states to assess the human rights risks before granting authorisations of these types of equipment, in line with other trade control regimes of dangerous goods, like conventional arms.
Background to the resolution
The “Global Alliance to end the trade in goods used in torture and capital punishment” (Alliance for Torture-free Trade) is an initiative led by the EU, Mongolia, Cape Verde and Argentina, launched in September 2017.
On 24 September 2018, at the first Alliance for Torture-free Trade ministerial meeting, members committed to promoting and sponsoring a draft resolution, to be adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its seventy-third session, entitled ‘Towards Torture-free Trade: examining the feasibility, scope and parameters for possible common international standards’.
The resolution will open up a process to gather States’ views on the scope, feasibility and requirements to establish common international standards for the import, export and transfer of goods used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
62 states are members of the Alliance and many other States are adding their support to the resolution.

From 1 June 2019, contraceptives and family planning clinic consultations will be free of charge in Burkina Faso. The government announcement, made in December 2018, was a direct response to our 2015 My Body My Rights petition and human rights manifesto calling for these measures to be put in place. Free contraceptives will make a huge difference to women like Korotimi. “Sometimes we don’t have any money to pay for contraception,” she had said, when we spoke to her in 2015. “[T]hat is how I came to have eight children.” With those financial barriers removed, women will have better access to birth control and more choice over what happens to their bodies. Also responding to Amnesty calls, Burkina Faso made it easier to prosecute cases of forced marriage as the law now recognises traditional marriages (where the majority of forced marriages happen), not just those performed by a civil registrar.

In January 2019, abortion services were finally opened to women in Ireland. This followed a historic referendum in May 2018 that marked a huge victory for women’s rights. The amazing result overturned the constitutional ban on abortion, allowing it in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and in exceptional circumstances. It was an outcome arising from years of dedicated work by activists, including Amnesty International. In 2015, we launched our She is not a criminal campaign. Our research, activism and advocacy helped convince the government to schedule the referendum and enact this new law. Our campaign also opened up space for women to share their experience of abortion, helping to undo the shame and stigma associated with it in the country. It encouraged a powerful conversation that helped catalyse the abortion debate in Ireland, ultimately ending in greater protection for women there.

With our #ToxicTwitter campaign, launched in March 2018, we showed how online abuse on the platform is having a serious impact on women’s right to freedom of expression, more so for women of colour, LBTI women and other women with intersecting identities. In the wake of our report, Twitter introduced improvements to its hateful conduct policy focused on banning “dehumanising speech”, and, for the first time, published data on how it enforces its own rules – a direct response to our calls. Twitter still didn’t release the disaggregated data, though, so we took matters into our own hands and launched Troll Patrol, an innovative crowdsourced research project to reveal the sheer scale and nature of online abuse faced by women. Working with technical experts and with over 6,500 digital activists from more than 150 countries, we created the largest crowdsourced dataset of online abuse against women. Our findings, released in December 2018, were shocking. A woman was abused on Twitter every 30 seconds. Black women were 84% more likely to receive abusive tweets than white women. Yet again, Twitter’s toxicity made headlines as our findings sent their share price tumbling within days, putting more pressure on Twitter to address our calls.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a judgement in November 2018 in the case of 11 women who were beaten, harassed and raped by security forces in Mexico following their arrest at demonstrations in May 2006. Although Mexico admitted that officers had used excessive force, they denied it was systemic, blaming individuals for the abuse. The Court, however, disagreed, saying the Mexican state was responsible. The Court also made clear that the sexual violence meted out to the women was torture. Amnesty has supported these women since 2006 when it documented the abuses and triggered an international campaign. The judgement is not only a victory for them, but also gives other survivors of gender-based violence by Mexico’s security forces a precedent on which to build their own cases.  
Sweden introduced a new law recognising sex without consent as rape on 1 July 2018. It was a huge step forward for women in the country, buoyed by the #MeToo movement and propelled by years of campaigning by women’s rights organizations, for example the grassroots movement FATTA. Amnesty, too, played a role in achieving this momentous change, monitoring and exposing gaps in rape laws in Sweden and other Nordic countries. Sweden was the 8th country in Western Europe to adopt consent-based laws, following in the footsteps of Iceland. As activists, including Amnesty, continue to raise their voices for ‘Yes’, Denmark is poised to follow suit and authorities in countries such as Finland, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia are also considering such changes.

FULL TEXT OF LETTER
We stand united against efforts to destroy civil society
In response to the absurd allegations levelled against Osman Kavala and Yiğit Aksakoğlu, who are both imprisoned pending trial, as well as 14 other civil society figures, all of whom are accused of “attempting to overthrow the government”, we, the undersigned human rights organizations, call for the escalating crackdown on and criminalization of civil society to end.
For the last five days, alleged details of an indictment against these 16 civil society actors have been leaked through the mainstream media in Turkey in a coordinated campaign of misinformation. According to purported leaks from the indictment, which has yet to be seen by lawyers representing the accused, the allegations focus on the 2013 Gezi Park protests, an overwhelmingly peaceful protest movement that was suppressed by the government amidst widespread police violence.
A much larger group of civil society figures continue to be investigated under the auspices of the same investigation. Those under investigation and those facing indictment are neither responsible for the Gezi Park protests, which ought to be considered as a matter of freedom of expression, nor for any crimes. The court should reject any indictment based on absurd conspiracies and which lack any meaningful evidence, and Osman Kavala and Yiğit Aksakoğlu, who have been imprisoned for 16 and 3 months respectively, should be immediately released.
This latest assault on civil society comes at a time when human rights defenders and other civil society activists increasingly face detention, prosecution and imprisonment simply for exposing human rights violations and for demanding truth, justice and means of redress.
The seventh hearing of the “Büyükada” trial of 11 human rights defenders will be held next month. No evidence has been presented in this trial to substantiate the trumped-upcharges of terrorism, which are based solely on the human rights activism of the accused.
Today, human rights defenders Şebnem Korur Fincancı, Erol Önderoğlu and Ahmet Nesin are in court accused of producing ‘terrorist propaganda’ by participating in a solidarity action with the now closed Özgür Gündemnewspaper. Journalists who worked for Özgür Gündem are also facing a campaign of judicial harassment. Two months ago, Şebnem Korur Fincancı was convicted of producing ‘terrorist propaganda’ and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for signing the ‘Peace Petition’. This conviction is pending an appeal at a regional appeals court. However, in previous rulings these appeals courts have wholly failed to prove themselves to be independent of the government. Human rights defender Eren Keskin, who acted as co-editor-in-chief of Özgür Gündem in an act of solidarity with the newspaper, is also being tried in over 100 cases. Meanwhile, 129 individuals from Academics for Peace have been sentenced to imprisonment. 25 of these individuals will be imprisoned if the regional appeals court upholds their convictions. Their appeals are ongoing.
Both the solidarity with Özgür Gündem and Academics for Peace trials are among those being used by the government to supress and silence hundreds of civil society activists in Turkey. This situation has emerged just as the courts have been handing down ever harsher prison sentences for similar acts of legitimate and peaceful dissent.
International treaties to which Turkey is a state party place a special emphasis on the important role played by human rights defenders, civil society and a free press in ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The effective protection of the freedom, security, dignity and physical and psychological integrity of human rights defenders is also a precondition for the right to defend human rights.
International law also insists that the fundamental responsibility for protecting human rights defenders belongs to the state. The state is ultimately responsible for protecting all rights enjoyed by human rights defenders: from the rights to freedom of thought and expression to the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly.
We, the undersigned organizations, stand united against these efforts to destroy independent civil society in Turkey, call for an end to the orchestrated campaign of intimidation and judicial harassment of civil society activists in Turkey and once again remind the authorities of their obligations to protect human rights defenders under international law.

0,Nevsun Before the Supreme Court,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/nevsun-before-the-supreme-court/,"On January 23rd, the Supreme Court of Canada will decide whether to allow a ground-breaking lawsuit to go forward against a Canadian mining company for the use of slavery.

Yes, you read that right: a Canadian company is going before the Supreme Court of Canada to determine whether it can be sued for the use of slavery. 
In 2008, Nevsun Resources (NSU) entered into a joint-venture partnership with the Eritrean government to develop the Bisha gold-zinc-copper mine. Nevsun owns 60 percent of Bisha while the Eritrean state owns the other 40 percent. Bisha is the largest single source of revenue to the Eritrean government, bringing in over $1 billion in taxes and other payments (such as royalties) since exploitation began in 2011. 
According to an interview by the Globe and Mail with former Nevsun CEO Cliff Davis, Davis was asked about human rights concerns in Eritrea, to which he responded, “There are always trade-offs in where you’re working. As a mining company, we shouldn’t be imposing some form of political environment that we’re familiar with.” In other words, insisting on respect for human rights would be an imposition on the Eritrean government! 
Nevsun would have been aware that Eritrea is ruled by a brutal dictatorship which has not allowed elections or implemented its constitution and that the United Nations calls it one of the worst  human rights abusers in the world. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly and association are severely limited. Eritrea relies on a conscription program that forces young Eritreans into government or military service, sometimes for decades. Conscripts say these jobs involve abuse, starvation, low or no pay, and slavery-like conditions. 
As part of its arrangement with the Eritrean government, Nevsun was partnered with a state-controlled construction company called Segen Construction which reportedly used conscripted labour to build the Bisha mine. Workers claim they were beaten, starved, unpaid, and kept prisoner during their years building the mine. The United Nations has called Eritrea’s conscription program ‘enslavement’. In 2013, Nevsun was forced to confirm that conscripted labour had been used at the mine. However, it says third-party audits show that Bisha now conforms to international standards. 
In 2014, three Eritrean refugees and former conscripted workers at Bisha filed a lawsuit against Nevsun in BC Supreme Court alleging Nevsun was complicit in the use of torture, forced labour, slavery and crimes against humanity. They described working 10 hours per day, six days per week without enough food or even beds in their huts, receiving beatings, chemical and sun burns from working without safety equipment, and the use of torture techniques as a form of punishment. They are asking for justice and reparations for what they suffered. 
In 2016 and again in 2017 the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeal rejected Nevsun’s claim that the plaintiffs would receive a fair trial in Eritrea. Nevsun has since appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Canada should not hear the case against it for the use of slavery and human rights abuses at its Bisha mine. 
This is an historic case, one which could determine how Canadian companies will be held accountable in the future for their overseas investment projects.   
Amnesty International Canada and the International Commission of Jurists have been granted status in the January 23 Supreme Court hearing as interveners or ‘friends of the court’. Amnesty will submit that Canada must ensure that victims of corporate human rights abuses have access to effective remedy, which the BC Appeal Court ruled is not possible in Eritrea.

0,Nevsun Before the Supreme Court,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-nevsun-supreme-court/,"On January 23rd, the Supreme Court of Canada will decide whether to allow a ground-breaking lawsuit to go forward against a Canadian mining company for the use of slavery.

Yes, you read that right: a Canadian company is going before the Supreme Court of Canada to determine whether it can be sued for the use of slavery. 
In 2008, Nevsun Resources (NSU) entered into a joint-venture partnership with the Eritrean government to develop the Bisha gold-zinc-copper mine. Nevsun owns 60 percent of Bisha while the Eritrean state owns the other 40 percent. Bisha is the largest single source of revenue to the Eritrean government, bringing in over $1 billion in taxes and other payments (such as royalties) since exploitation began in 2011. 
According to an interview by the Globe and Mail with former Nevsun CEO Cliff Davis, Davis was asked about human rights concerns in Eritrea, to which he responded, “There are always trade-offs in where you’re working. As a mining company, we shouldn’t be imposing some form of political environment that we’re familiar with.” In other words, insisting on respect for human rights would be an imposition on the Eritrean government! 
Nevsun would have been aware that Eritrea is ruled by a brutal dictatorship which has not allowed elections or implemented its constitution and that the United Nations calls it one of the worst  human rights abusers in the world. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly and association are severely limited. Eritrea relies on a conscription program that forces young Eritreans into government or military service, sometimes for decades. Conscripts say these jobs involve abuse, starvation, low or no pay, and slavery-like conditions. 
As part of its arrangement with the Eritrean government, Nevsun was partnered with a state-controlled construction company called Segen Construction which reportedly used conscripted labour to build the Bisha mine. Workers claim they were beaten, starved, unpaid, and kept prisoner during their years building the mine. The United Nations has called Eritrea’s conscription program ‘enslavement’. In 2013, Nevsun was forced to confirm that conscripted labour had been used at the mine. However, it says third-party audits show that Bisha now conforms to international standards. 
In 2014, three Eritrean refugees and former conscripted workers at Bisha filed a lawsuit against Nevsun in BC Supreme Court alleging Nevsun was complicit in the use of torture, forced labour, slavery and crimes against humanity. They described working 10 hours per day, six days per week without enough food or even beds in their huts, receiving beatings, chemical and sun burns from working without safety equipment, and the use of torture techniques as a form of punishment. They are asking for justice and reparations for what they suffered. 
In 2016 and again in 2017 the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeal rejected Nevsun’s claim that the plaintiffs would receive a fair trial in Eritrea. Nevsun has since appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Canada should not hear the case against it for the use of slavery and human rights abuses at its Bisha mine.

Google publicly exited the search engine market in China in 2010, citing restrictions to freedom of expression online. Since then, the Chinese government has strengthened its controls over the internet and intensified its crackdown on freedom of expression.  
Indicating a reversal in strategy, Google is now preparing to re-enter the Chinese search engine market, and is developing a new, search engine app codenamed “Dragonfly” that would facilitate China’s online censorship and surveillance. This would represent an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights, and a dark day for internet freedom as it would legitimize China’s model of internet repression for other governments and set a precedent for tech companies compromising human rights in exchange for access to new markets. 
It has been reported in the media that Google is now planning to drop its Dragonfly project. While this is amazing news, it isn’t confirmed yet, so we intend to keep the pressure on until it it official.

In 2010, the largest search engine in the world made a promise not to support China’s censorship of the internet. But it was recently revealed that Google is preparing to break its promise. 
Google has been working on a secretive program to re-launch its search engine in China code-named Google Dragonfly – even if it means cooperating with the Chinese government’s repressive online censorship and surveillance. 
People using Google in China would be blocked from accessing banned websites like Wikipedia and Facebook. Content from search terms like ‘human rights’ would be banned. The Chinese government would even be able to spy on Google’s users – this is a government that routinely sends people to prison for merely sharing their views online. 
If Google is willing to trade human rights for profit in China, could they do the same in other countries?

It started in Poland with a young man trying to impress a young woman. He met her at a festival and she told him about 24-hour events she’d been to in Africa, where people wrote letters of protest to governments. Inspired by her story – and wanting to see her again – he invited her to his local Amnesty group where they decided to do the same thing. 
The idea caught on and within a year, Write for Rights grew into a global letter-writing phenomenon. That was 2002. Today, Write for Rights is the world’s biggest human rights event, and with good cause. Over the years, the campaign has helped free at least 48 people from wrongful imprisonment. That’s 48 lives renewed and transformed – thanks to millions of actions by people like you in almost every part of the world. 
Here are just 15 highlights from the last 15 years – reason, if any, to get writing for rights this year. 
Please take a moment to be inspired by these successes—and then make sure to sign up for this year’s Write for Rights campaign on December 10th

1. Albert Woodfox, USA 
The last imprisoned member of the Angola 3, Albert Woodfox was finally released in February 2016. He had spent 43 years and 10 months in solitary confinement in a Louisiana state prison – believed to be the longest anyone has survived in solitary in the USA. “I can’t emphasise enough how important getting letters from people around the world is,” said Albert. “It gave me a sense of worth. It gave me strength – convinced me that what I was doing was right.” Supporters took more than 650,000 actions for his release as part of Write for Rights. 
 
2. ALES BIALIATSKI, BELARUS 
Prominent human rights defender, Ales Bialiatski was freed from a labour camp in Belarus in 2014. Featured in Write for Rights 2012, he received 40,000 letters from Amnesty supporters. “I want to thank you especially for the moral support,” he said on his release. “The thing that made a real difference were the letters I got from ordinary people, and I want you to say a special thank you to your activists for that.” 
 
3. BIRTUKAN MIDEKSA, ETHIOPIA 
Ethiopian opposition leader Birtukan Mideksa was released from jail in October 2010 after featuring in Write for Rights the year before. Speaking to us in 2013, she said: “The pressure you guys were exerting on the Ethiopian government was very instrumental in securing my release.” 
 
4. CHELSEA MANNING, USA 
US whistle-blower Chelsea Manning walked free in May 2017, after her 35-year prison sentence was cut short by outgoing President Barack Obama. In 2015 more than a quarter of a million people wrote for her release. She said: “I wish I had the time and ability to thank each one of you for giving me a little bit of joy with each letter and card.” 
 
5. YORM BOPHA, CAMBODIA 
Housing rights activist Yorm Bopha was released in November 2013. She led vocal protests against efforts to throw her community off their land, and was eventually imprisoned on bogus charges. Although the charges against her were never dropped, she was able to return home. “Thank you to Amnesty International’s supporters!” she said. “Your campaign has been successful, as my release shows!” 
 
6. Fred Bauma & Yves Makwamba, DRC 
Youth activists Fred and Yves were released at the end of August 2016 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. An amazing 170,000 people took action for the pair as part of Write for Rights. “Every letter, every visit, every word has strengthened us and reinforced our determination in this long but just struggle for freedom and democracy,” said Yves. Ten of their fellow 
 
7. JABBAR SAVALAN, AZERBAIJAN 
A youth activist jailed in Azerbaijan, Jabbar Savalan was pardoned and released in 2011 within days of supporters’ letters arriving in the country. He had been jailed on false drug charges after he dared to call for peaceful protests against the government. “The support I received was so great that I did not feel like I was imprisoned,” he said. 
 
8. JABEUR MEJRI, TUNISIA 
Jabeur Mejri was pardoned in 2014 and provisionally released, following global pressure from Amnesty supporters who joined Write for Rights 2013. Jabeur had spent two years in prison for Facebook posts deemed offensive to Islam. “Things got better when there was more attention on my case and some activists and lawyers came to visit me in prison,” said Jabeur. “Amnesty International’s support had a great impact, I’m very happy you raised awareness about my case, not just with your activists but amongst the Tunisian public as well.” 
 
9. JEANETTE SOLSTAD REMØ, NORWAY 
June 2016 marked the end of Jeanette Solstad Remø’s fight to have her right to be recognised as a woman, without compromising her dignity and human rights. Norway passed a new law giving transgender people access to legal gender recognition through a quick, accessible and transparent procedure. Through Write for Rights 2014, thousands of people supported Jeanette’s campaign, leading to a historic legal change that has done away with Norway’s shameful legacy of invasive procedures that violate human rights. 
 
10. JERRYME CORRE, PHILIPPINES 
Jerryme Corre spent four years in prison after being seized by police in 2012 and tortured into confessing to a crime he didn’t commit. Featured in Write for Rights 2014, his case prompted the support of 70,000 people worldwide, leading the Philippines authorities to open an investigation into Jerryme’s allegations of torture against one of the police officers. In March 2016, police officer Jerick Dee Jimenez was convicted of torture and sentenced to a prison term. He was also made to pay Jerryme damages. It was a historic ruling on police torture in the Philippines, which saw the first conviction under the country’s 2009 Anti-Torture Act following years of steadfast campaigning by Amnesty activists. 
 
11. MOSES AKATUGBA, NIGERIA 
After 10 years in jail and more than 800,000 messages from activists around the world, Moses Akatugba’s life was spared in June 2015. Falsely accused of stealing three mobile phones, he had been tortured and wrongfully sentenced to death when he was 16. He was granted a full pardon after pressure from Amnesty supporters during Write for Rights 2014 and our Stop Torture campaign. “Amnesty International members and activists are my heroes,” Moses said. “I promise to be a human rights activist – to fight for others.” 
 
12. MUHAMMAD BEKZHANOV, UZBEKISTAN 
Journalist Muhammad Bekzhanov was released in February 2017 after spending 17 years in prison. One of the world’s longest held journalists, he was supported by thousands around the world as part of Write for Rights 2015 and our Stop Torture campaign. 
 
13. DR TUN AUNG, MYANMAR 
Prisoner of conscience Dr Tun Aung was released in January 2015. The Muslim community leader had been sentenced to 17 years in jail in 2012 for trying to calm a riot between Buddhist and Rohingya communities in Rakhine State. Thousands worldwide wrote for his freedom as part of Write for Rights 2013. Today, Dr Tun Aung is now an Amnesty member. He says: “I will never forget I myself was one of those for whom so many kind people participated in Write for Rights. It contributed significantly to my eventual release. Now I write for those still in prison for speaking out against human right violations.” 
 
14. VALENTINA ROSENDO CANTÚ AND INÉS FERNÁNDEZ ORTEGA 
Mexico’s government finally accepted responsibility for the rape by soldiers of Valentina Rosendo Cantú and Inés Fernández Ortega. The two women had been raped by soldiers in the Mexican Army in 2002. Since then, they embarked on a tireless campaign for justice. Amnesty amplified their calls through Write for Rights 2011. “Without your letters, your action and your solidarity, we would have not achieved this moment,” Valentina said. 
 
15. Yecenia Armenta, Mexico 
Yecenia Armenta was freed from prison in June 2016. Detained on 10 July 2012, she was beaten, near-asphyxiated and raped during 15 hours of torture until she was forced to “confess” to being involved in her husband’s murder. Amnesty supporters took some 300,000 actions for her as part of our Stop Torture and Write for Rights campaigns. “When I receive all these letters saying that I’m not alone,” she said, “it makes me feel great. And I think: ‘Yes, it’s true, I’m not alone.”

She was one of thousands of Irish ex-pats who traveled home to Ireland to vote in the historic referendum on whether to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution, which bans abortion. On May 25th Ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal the eighth amendment, paving the way for safe and legal abortion services in Ireland. Learn more>> 
There’s a strong Irish community across Canada and particularly in Toronto. Over the past year that I’ve been in Toronto we have come together to take action, show solidarity, and to fundraise for the Together for Yes Campaign. We are a funny group that didn’t really know one another outside of this campaign, and yet the bond that connects us now runs so deep. We came together around a shared belief that women can and should be trusted to make decisions that affect their lives and bodies and that women should have access to safe, legal, and compassionate healthcare in Ireland. 
Most people in the Irish in Toronto Together for Yes group had been residing outside Ireland for more than 18 months and were ineligible to vote in the May 25 referendum on abortion rights. But that didn’t stop them coming out to show their solidarity and support!

Being able to choose to travel home to vote in this historic referendum meant the world to me and to so many others as is evidenced through the masses of people who traveled #HomeToVote. It was touching to see crowdfunding initiatives pop up to fund those who were eligible to vote but who couldn’t afford the travel to get home.  
Sad reflection as i wait to board my flight #HomeToVote – the cost of my travel from #Toronto was less than my travel costs to the UK when I needed to access safe abortion services. #together4yes #Repealthe8th

As I started my journey home it was it was sad to realise that my travel costs home to vote was less than what I had to pay when I was forced to travel to the UK to access safe abortion services many years ago.

I spent the week I was home with family and friends speaking about the referendum and our shared hopes and fears around the possible outcomes. We spoke about the frightening current reality for women living in Ireland following the recent #IBelieveHer Belfast rape trial, the murder of 14 year old Anastasia Kriegel, and the abduction and murder of 24-year-old Jastine Valdez. The days leading up to the vote were filled with anguish and anxiety. I kept hearing from friends how the messages coming through the #HomeToVote hashtag was getting them through the last days and weeks – providing hope and solidarity from people from all corners of the world coming home to vote yes.  
Repeal groups were set up across multiple countries and support and solidarity was pouring in from multiple channels. I was told on more than one occasion while I was home that it was this international solidarity that provided the necessary hope for those who were on the ground canvassing across Ireland, who were really feeling the divisiveness of the anti-choice campaign in the final weeks before the referendum.

I woke up early on the day of the vote and had a hearty breakfast with my mum. We went over to vote together before she had to leave for work. As I placed my X in the yes box, I thought about all the women in Ireland who have suffered because of the 8th amendment. I left the polling station filled with hope and at the same time was trying to prepare myself in case the final decision went the other way. I didn’t want to let myself believe the Irish Times exit polls that night which suggested it would be a landslide for repeal.  
I stayed at home to watch the live coverage of the voting updates as they came in. I spent the day taking deep breaths trying to hold back the tears. As final tallies came in with a resounding yes I felt elated and in a state of pure disbelief. I was filled with an overwhelming sense of triumph and liberation and yet there was a simultaneous numbness and complete emptiness. These feelings were coupled with a  sense of release – a letting go of all the grief that had been held in that had previously been fueling the struggle to get to this point. 
As a young student I was working on an art project based on the last Magdalene laundry to close on Sean McDermott St. and was really getting immersed in the history of women’s oppression in Ireland. I remember joining public meetings and listening to Ailbhe Smith talk about the history of the X case and calling for us to stand with women and to trust them with decisions over their own bodies. She captivated me – and many others, we knew that this wasn’t going to change unless we got up and did something about about it. This was my entry point into activism.  
I began joining demonstrations, mobilizations, and marches in Dublin city centre – where I met and learned from other women who shared the same concerns and values as me. I was constantly creating new banners and placards to bring with me. I later worked with friends to set up a feminist society on campus and we were using this space to inform and challenge one another and ourselves.

I was learning all the time more and more about the stats and facts of women traveling to the UK to access abortion services, and had become an advocate for change starting discussions in my family and circles of friends. Little did I know that I would soon find myself in the unimaginable situation of being in a crisis pregnancy and forced to travel to the UK to access safe abortion services myself.  
The word alone doesn’t quite capture the depths of isolation that crept in. I felt like a criminal walking up the street towards the Marie Stopes clinic to get some crisis pregnancy information. My mind was filled with what if’s, and’s and maybes. All of a sudden I was accosted by a woman and a man, it took me a few moments to realise what was happening. I found myself halfway down the street after they linked my arms and pulled me away from the clinic. They had placed a small plastic baby in my hands and told me they wanted me to meet their friend in a nearby cafe. Their friend who had an abortion and regretted it. I was caught off guard. I tried to say I had an appointment and needed to leave, but as I started to walk away they called me a murderer as their two other friends stood praying at me with their rosary beads.  
My head was pounding with an unparalleled headache from the lack of sleep and the constant thinking and going over all the potential possibilities. Unlike many other women in Ireland, I had the means to travel to the UK to access safe abortion services. Although despite being able to afford it, you still feel the absolute shame of being forced to leave. My mum came with me to support me knowing that this was the single most difficult decision I ever had to make. I never scheduled any appointments for after care services when I got home because of the previous intimidating experience I had with anti-choice people calling me a murderer. 
When I heard the news about the death of Savita Halappanavar I had this very heavy and unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach. I remember the absolute silence of the massive crowds that gathered on the streets outside the Dail. We gathered for vigils for weeks in the cold – there was a strong collective grieving process happening and I remember looking around me at faces wet with tears, filled with frustration, disbelief and anger with a system that would not not value the health and life of this woman – of women in Ireland. Savita had ignited a fire in the hearts of many people. There was hope to be found in fighting for her legacy.

As I waited in the airport for my flight back to Toronto I felt like we had finally managed to fight for  the first step towards a more compassionate Ireland – for Savita, for all women and trans men across the country. I hope we can continue to join the dots of systemic violence and oppression women are facing.

Bill C-262 provides principled framework for implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
Our nations and organizations are urging all Members of Parliament to support Bill C-262 in a non-partisan manner when it comes to a vote at third reading.
The government of Stephen Harper endorsed the UN Declaration in 2010 and expressed “confidence” that the Declaration is consistent with Canada’s Constitution and legal framework. The government of Justin Trudeau has repeatedly pledged to fully implement the Declaration. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, whose Calls to Action have been widely endorsed by a wide range of political parties at the federal, provincial and territorial levels, urged all governments to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as ‘the framework for reconciliation’ in Canada.  
Bill C-262 provides a legislative framework for the federal government to now move forward with the important and urgent work of implementing the Declaration.
Bill C-262 would require the federal government to collaborate with Indigenous peoples in developing a national action plan to implement the UN Declaration. C-262 also calls for a collaborative process to ensure that Canada’s laws live up to the human rights affirmed in the UN Declaration.
In Canadian legal tradition, international human rights instruments are considered as relevant and persuasive sources of interpreting human rights domestically. Canadian courts and tribunals are already using the Declaration in this way.
As a legislative framework that includes regular reporting to Parliament, Bill C-262 also provides the means to hold this and future governments accountable to the commitments that have been made to honour and respect the rights of Indigenous peoples.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission clearly told us that reconciliation requires hard work by all sectors of society. Adoption of Bill C-262 is a vital part of this journey. Our governments and organizations strongly believe that the collaborative, non-adversarial approach set out in Bill C-262 is in the best interest of all Canadians. We strongly encourage all Members of Parliament to actively support Bill C-262 from this principled perspective.
Background
The UN Declaration was the subject of one of the most extensive standard setting processes ever undertaken in the international human rights system. The collaboration between Canadian government representatives and Indigenous peoples during the final years of negotiation was a key factor in developing a text that could attain broad, global support. Today, the Declaration stands as a global human rights instrument, reaffirmed 8 times by the UN General Assembly by consensus.
Bill C-262 has five key elements: 
Bill C-262 sets out the principles that must guide implementation of the Declaration, including repudiation of colonialism.
Bill C-262 provides clear public affirmation that the standards set out in the UN Declaration have “application in Canadian law.”
Bill C-262 requires a collaborative process for the review of federal legislation to ensure consistency with the minimum standards set out in the UN Declaration.
Bill C-262 requires the federal government to work with Indigenous peoples to develop a national action plan to implement the UN Declaration.
Bill C-262 provides transparency and accountability by requiring annual reporting to Parliament on progress made toward implementation of the Declaration.

Amnesty International is urging the Governments of Nigeria, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to launch investigations into the role of Shell Oil regarding the horrific crimes committed in Ogoniland by the Nigerian military during the 1990s. 
To recap: in 1995, nine men from Ogoniland were executed. The executions of the Ogoni Nine, after an unfair trial, were the culmination of a much broader crackdown on the Ogoni people by the Nigerian military government. 
Amnesty`s latest report examines he widespread human rights violations including unlawful killings, torture, rape and the destruction of homes and property, carried out by the military in the years leading up to the executions in 1995. 
 
Photo: Five of the defendants at the Ogoni Civil Disturbances Tribunal in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, 1995. From right: Ledum Mitee, Baribor Bera, Ken Saro-Wiwa, John Kpuinem, Barinem Kiobel. All except for Ledum Mittee were convicted after a politically-motivated and unfair trial and then hanged, along with five other men. 
Amnesty reviewed thousands of pages of internal company documents and witness statements in order to reach our conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell repeatedly encouraged the Nigerian military to deal with community protests, even when they knew it would lead to massive human rights violations. 
 
The ultimate responsibility for the human rights violations documented in the new Amnesty report, and the executions of the Ogoni Nine, lies with the Nigerian government. However, Amnesty`s research shows that Shell knew that the security forces regularly committed grave human rights violations in Ogoniland, knew that asking for or encouraging the security forces to enter Ogoniland would likely result in violations – yet still repeatedly solicited and encouraged the intervention of the armed forces in Ogoniland. 
Moreover, the evidence provides numerous examples of times when Shell’s requests were quickly followed by action by the security forces. An individual or company can be held criminally responsible for a crime if they encourage, enable, exacerbate or facilitate it, even if they were not direct actors. For example, knowledge of the risks that corporate conduct could contribute to a crime, or a close connection to the perpetrators, could lead to criminal liability. 
 
Shell has denied the allegations by Amnesty. Given the evidence, an investigation into these allegations is required. Before his execution, Ken Saro-Wiwa said that one day Shell would face its day in court. We must make that happen. 
Although some of the victims and their families filed civil claims against Shell, and Shell has made some payments to families, the evidence against the company has never been heard in court. Shell has paid only with the agreement that they would not accept any liability, describing the payment as a “humanitarian gesture”.

Confronting Shell Oil … Again! 
Three years after the ground-breaking report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on oil pollution in Ogoniland, the people of Ogoniland continued to suffer the effects of fifty years of an oil industry that has polluted their land, air and water. The oil company Shell and the Nigerian Government both failed to implement recommendations made in the UNEP report and put an end to the abuse of the communities’ rights to food, water and a life free of pollution. 
The 2011 UNEP Report made 27 recommendations, including the establishment of a $1 billion fund for the clean-up and compensation. In August 2014, Amnesty issued a report titled “No Progress”, with Amnesty’s assessment that NONE of the recommendations had been completed. The Government of Nigeria and Shell had taken almost no meaningful action to implement any of the recommendations. 
 
Shell Oil pipelines are poorly maintained. Shell Oil’s own numbers admit to over 1,500 oil spills releasing over 350,000 barrels of oil in just 8 years (2007-2014). 
Since the 2011 UNEP report, rather than fix the massive problems identified, Shell has made efforts to distance itself from the UNEP study which they partially funded. The company appeared to have been taken by surprise by the scientific findings that expose its failure to make its operations safe and to properly clean up pollution. 
The action that has been taken has consisted largely of establishing processes that are ostensibly aimed at implementation. The failure to fully implement any of the non-emergency measures after three years has resulted in a loss of confidence amongst many stakeholders. Even the emergency measures have only been partially implemented. 
 
At this point, our campaigning took a more aggressive approach. Amnesty UK used Shell’s logo, with some adjustments, to make the point more obvious, and used phrases such as “Get the (S)hell out!”. Amnesty Canada had to be careful regarding a SLAPP-type lawsuit because there was no SLAPP protection law in place in Ontario at this time. 
Amnesty obtained access to thousands of documents from the Nigerian Government and Shell Oil that allowed for independent research into subjects such as a detailed analysis of the causes of the many oil spills and the role of Shell Oil throughout the years. By 2017, by utilizing hundreds of hours of volunteer resources through our “Oil Spill Decoders project”, as well as legal experts, Amnesty gained a comprehensive understanding of what the historical documents tell us.

Fleeing violence and dreaming of safety in the United States. 
Every year, tens of thousands of people come to the U.S. southern border seeking safety. They are trying to escape horrific violence and persecution, and going there to ask for asylum, a form of protection recognized under U.S. and international law. 
The Problem 
Upon entering the U.S., many people seeking safety here are imprisoned and held behind bars for many weeks, months, and even years, without easy access to lawyers or interpreters.The majority come from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in Central America. But they also come from Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detains families seeking asylum at three family detention centers. They hold as many as 3,000 kids and parents each day. Berks County Residential Center in Pennsylvania is the oldest of these “baby jails.” Some children and parents are deported without ever having their claims for protection heard – forced to return to countries where they may be tortured, imprisoned, or even killed. 
AMNESTY IN ACTION 
Amnesty International has helped protect the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers for decades – documenting the conditions they are fleeing, ensuring that individual people are protected, and changing policies so that more people can rebuild their lives.Last year, Amnesty International campaigned for the release of four families held at Berks family detention center. They had been jailed there for nearly two years. In August, all four families were friends. One child was three-years-old when released. He learned to walk and talk behind bars.

While the four Berks families are free, the battle doesn’t end there. The government is trying to put them back in jail, and new families continue to be locked up every day at Berks as well as the other detention sites in Karnes City and Dilley, Texas. Family detention is inhumane, expensive, and undermines the United States’ long history as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety. It’s time the U.S. free all families in detention like #TheBerksKids.

Fleeing violence and dreaming of safety in the United States. 
Every year, tens of thousands of people come to the U.S. southern border seeking safety. They are trying to escape horrific violence and persecution, and going there to ask for asylum, a form of protection recognized under U.S. and international law. 
The Problem 
Upon entering the U.S., many people seeking safety here are imprisoned and held behind bars for many weeks, months, and even years, without easy access to lawyers or interpreters.The majority come from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in Central America. But they also come from Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detains families seeking asylum at three family detention centers. They hold as many as 3,000 kids and parents each day. Berks County Residential Center in Pennsylvania is the oldest of these “baby jails.” Some children and parents are deported without ever having their claims for protection heard – forced to return to countries where they may be tortured, imprisoned, or even killed. 
AMNESTY IN ACTION 
Amnesty International has helped protect the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers for decades – documenting the conditions they are fleeing, ensuring that individual people are protected, and changing policies so that more people can rebuild their lives.Last year, Amnesty International campaigned for the release of four families held at Berks family detention center. They had been jailed there for nearly two years. In August, all four families were friends. One child was three-years-old when released. He learned to walk and talk behind bars. Our urgent action to free these children and their parents was part of #TheBerksKids campaign to end the policy of detaining families simply for seeking safety in the U.S.

Written by Amnesty’s Businses and Human Rights volunteer, Ian Heide 
Throughout the years, Amnesty International has continued to put pressure on Shell Oil for the company’s role in the Niger Delta. Amnesty’s 2009 report “Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta” focused on some of the root causes of the complex conflict situation in the Niger Delta, including: 
These factors are key drivers of conflict and poverty in the Niger Delta. 
Listen to our Niger Delta “True Tragedy” podcast 
In Nigeria, there was country-wide coverage of Amnesty’s 2009 Niger Delta report, including television headline news and front page national paper articles. The Head of Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission participated in the report launch press conference and said that Nigeria should be able to initiate public interest litigation against the oil companies. 
Shell Oil responded quickly and publicly, stating that 85% of oil pollution is caused by sabotage (Amnesty challenges this statement). Shell also said that the Amnesty report did not deal with the complex problems of the Niger Delta. These are standard responses of Shell – to hide behind ‘it’s complex’ and ‘it’s the fault of communities or militants’ 
 
When Amnesty International visited the community at Kira Tai, people living there had no idea that Shell was blaming the spill on the community. People were still waiting for compensation for the damage done to the area where they lived. It is this kind of behaviour that feeds community distrust and anger, and in turn fuels conflict. 
Shell has made some positive contributions in Nigeria, including provision of employment; however, in human rights terms, positive action in one area does not absolve any actor of responsibilities for human rights harms elsewhere. Human rights abuses cannot be ‘offset’. The funds spent by Shell on education, health and capacity-building activities, as well as infrastructure, do not reverse the damage done to communities as a result of Shell’s core business activities in the Delta.

Amnesty International is calling on the Governments of Nigeria, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to launch investigations into the role of Shell Oil regarding the horrific crimes committed in Ogoniland by the Nigerian military during the 1990s. In 1995, nine men from Ogoniland were executed. The executions of the Ogoni Nine, after an unfair trial, were the culmination of a much broader crackdown on the Ogoni people by the Nigerian military government. Amnesty`s latest report focuses on widespread human rights violations including unlawful killings, torture, rape and the destruction of homes and property, carried out by the military in the years leading up to the executions in 1995. 
Amnesty International has reviewed thousands of pages of internal company documents and witness statements in order to reach this conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell repeatedly encouraged the Nigerian military to deal with community protests, even when they knew it would lead to massive human rights violations. 
The ultimate responsibility for the human rights violations documented in the new Amnesty report, and the executions of the Ogoni Nine, lies with the Nigerian government. However, Amnesty`s research shows that Shell knew that the security forces regularly committed grave human rights violations in Ogoniland, knew that asking for or encouraging the security forces to enter Ogoniland would likely result in violations – yet still repeatedly solicited and encouraged the intervention of the armed forces in Ogoniland. 
Moreover, the evidence provides numerous examples of times when Shell’s requests were quickly followed by action by the security forces. An individual or company can be held criminally responsible for a crime if they encourage, enable, exacerbate or facilitate it, even if they were not direct actors. For example, knowledge of the risks that corporate conduct could contribute to a crime, or a close connection to the perpetrators, could lead to criminal liability. 
Shell has denied the allegations by Amnesty. Given the evidence, an investigation into these allegations is required. In 1995, when Ken Saro-Wiwa was one of nine men sentence to death, before his execution he said that one day Shell would face its day in court. We must make that happen. 
Although some of the victims and their families filed civil claims against Shell, and Shell has made some payments to families, the evidence against the company has never been heard in court. Shell has paid only with the agreement that they would not accept any liability, describing the payment as a “humanitarian gesture”. 
In June 2017, the widows of four of the men charged Shell Oil with complicity in their deaths. Amnesty members around the world have been speaking out in support of Esther Kiobel, one of the four women seeking justice from Shell Oil.

İdil, the Director of Amnesty International Turkey, was detained along with nine others during a workshop in Istanbul. It came only a month after Amnesty International Turkey’s Chair, Taner Kılıç was detained. Currently eight imprisoned and two bailed defenders are facing an investigation on suspicion of aiding a terrorirst organisation, a ridiculous and baseless accusation. They have done nothing wrong. 
İdil has written a letter from her prison cell after a massive global response demanding their release. It’s a message of thanks, hope and courage. 
12 September 2017, Silivri Prison No. 9 
I would like to thank the entire Amnesty International movement. I send my heartfelt thanks to the International Secretariat, the [Amnesty Turkey] board, campaigners, people who have supported us with their signatures, and especially my colleagues who continue their work with self-sacrifice. 
I thank my friends, who are my family – although not biologically. I am glad to have you. I am sure that many people would covet having siblings and friends like you. I am sorry that I had to burden you with my own responsibilities. 
I am also sorry for the trouble caused to my colleagues, who have to deal with my case in addition to all the others. Together with the human rights defenders, I hope to be with you very soon. 
 
Amnesty members in London, UK protest the wrongful imprisonment of the Instanbul 10.  
In this process, I believe that Amnesty International plays a very important role in the application of human rights at a global scale. I always believed in the working methods and principles of the organisation and the importance of human rights; and I will keep believing in them. I am proud to be the Director of Amnesty International Turkey. In particular, I believe that organisations such as Amnesty International are becoming more important in a world where division and xenophobia are on the rise. 
I think that our cause has further strengthened the solidarity between rights organisations, and I rejoice. I really wish I could stay in the same ward as my friends who are also being investigated.

Among the attendees was Amnesty Turkey’s Director İdil Eser. Currently eight of them remain in prison and two are on bail, all facing an investigation under anti-terrorism laws. They have done nothing wrong. 
Peter has written a message from his cell about coping with life in prison: 
“To all who accompany me in thought and deed! 
A wholehearted thankyou to all who support us, especially to my family and friends (and all who support them), to the German government, Ministries, Embassy, Consulate; to my legal team, and to my holistic security team, HIVOS + KURVE Wustrow, to all political campaigns that demand our release! 
As I do not have any contact anymore with Ali and the other human rights defenders, I am writing this letter on my behalf only. 
[In July] I was arrested and since 1 August I have been in Silivri prison in Turkey. Now, I am sharing a three-person cell with a young Turkish detainee. We have one bedroom, one community room and our own courtyard of 28m2. The prison guards usually treat us in a respectful and friendly way. The food is good and sufficient. We get books through our lawyers and the embassy/consulate! 
Thus I can say that externally, and mostly also internally, I am doing fine. However, this is also hard work, our detention is a clear violation of international human rights law and the extreme limitation on communication is hard: once a week for 1 hour with our great lawyers, and only 10 minutes every other week by phone with our families. 
In all this, it helps to know that many people are thinking of me and of us. Every evening at 6pm Berlin time, in parallel with our friends in the Gethsemane Church, I am sitting in the courtyard singing loudly! This is so soothing! Even my cellmates already know the songs by now! 
Everyday life in prison takes place between the opening of the courtyard at 8am and the locking of the cells at 8pm: inspection of attendance, searching the cells, doing our laundry, cleaning the cell, playing chess and backgammon (both self-made boards). 
Then, in the evenings, we continue playing games and talking, writing diaries and, of course, progressive muscle relaxation every morning and late evening, so that I don‘t get cabin fever and so that the uncertainty-induced stress does not take over. Other than that, it‘s only chasing mosquitos that helps! 
It’s important to me that the political and legal responsibility for our situation isn‘t placed on Turkey as a country or its people. We experience a lot of solidarity through our Turkish legal team and the interreligious dialogue with my Muslim roommate. 
Those who know me know that there is a saying that carries me: if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together! 
In this spirit, let us walk the non-violent path of human rights together! 
With deep gratitude and strength, 
Yours, 
Peter

The leaders of the British Columbia NDP and Green parties announced yesterday that when they form the provincial government they will send the Site C megaproject to the independent BC Utilities Commission for a long overdue review. 
Such a review, which will try to determine the province’s actual energy needs and whether the cost of Site C is warranted, is widely expected to be the death knell for the $9 billion plus project. 
Critically, however, the province needs to come to terms with the consequences of outgoing Premier Christy Clark’s drive to push the dam to what she referred to as “the point of no return.” 
A University of British Columbia study recently concluded that stopping the project is still a better use of money than building a dam that will produce more power than is needed for decades. So far, the ecological harm to the Peace Valley is still reversible. 
However, multi-generation farms and First Nation graves and cultural sites are in the direct path of the current rush to build the dam. The NDP-Green coalition said yesterday that they won’t halt construction pending the review. This is alarming because it means that irreversible harm could be done in the name of a project that will never be completed. 
The fact that the NDP-Green coalition is clearly feeling pressure on both sides of the Site C controversy is all the more reason that the review itself must be rigorous and truly open to the input of diverse voices and concerns, including First Nations. 
A critical priority for the new government must be to undo the harm that has been done to relations with Indigenous peoples. Yesterday’s announcement failed to acknowledge ongoing, unresolved concerns over Site C’s violation of Indigenous rights protected in Treaty 8, the Constitution and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
The agreement between the NDP and Greens includes a welcome commitment to Indigenous rights. The agreement says that “the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls-to-action and the Tsilhqot’in Supreme Court decision” are “foundational” to the common cause of the two parties. Living up to the important words requires a clear commitment to uphold Indigenous rights in any decision made about the future of Site C.

January 25, 2017
Today President Donald Trump issued several executive orders related to immigration, including constructing a wall on the border with Mexico, building more detention centers, and stripping sanctuary cities of federal funding.
“We will fight this dangerous move with everything we’ve got,” said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.  “This wall would say that those from outside the United States, especially from Latin America, are to be feared and shunned – and that is just wrong.”
“Our members and supporters will demand that Congress protect people seeking asylum, including those fleeing violence in Latin America. We won’t let President Donald Trump create refugee camps along the U.S./Mexico border like the ones we’ve seen in Greece, Australia, and other countries.”
“Sanctuary city policies help protect people’s human rights in part by ensuring that the proper authorities are empowered to do their job. Local law enforcement should be working with communities to protect their safety and not acting as immigration agents.”
Amnesty International’s “I Welcome” campaign protects the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum by documenting human rights abuses and pressing governments to do their fair share to address this humanitarian crisis. In the U.S., Amnesty International is working to protect refugee resettlement programs and access to asylum at the U.S southern border, in particular opposing the harsh practice of automatically detaining children and their mothers who are seeking asylum and other practices that undermine meaningful access to protection.   
President Trump is also reportedly planning on signing executive orders regarding refugees, travel bans from Muslim-majority countries, and national security issues this week. Amnesty International will continue to monitor these and will have experts available.

This case concerns the proposal of Taseko Mines Limited to dig a gold-copper mine on the traditional territory of the Tsilhqot’in indigenous peoples near Teztan Biny and Fish Lake in British Columbia. The proposed mine pit would reach a diameter of up to 1.6 km, be surrounded by an exclusion area of almost 30 km2, and operations would bury large tracts of traditional land under a 12km2 tailings pond. The Tsilhqot’in people had previously established legal rights to continue cultural practices such as fishing and capture of wild horses throughout their traditional territory, and opposed the mine on the basis that it would have a severe impact on these rights. 
The proposed project had to undergo an environmental assessment process by a review panel under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA). The CEAA review panel was mandated to consider potential impacts of the mine on Aboriginal peoples’ health, socio-economic conditions, heritage, and traditional use of lands. Under the CEAA, the review panel was required to work in cooperation with the Tsilqot’in and other affected Indigenous peoples and take into consideration their traditional knowledge systems. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S INTERVENTION 
Amnesty International was one of several organizations invited by the review panel to provide submissions on the environmental assessment of the New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine Project. Our submissions spoke to both constitutional and international law respecting Indigenous peoples’ human rights, arguing that the consideration of the proposed New Prosperity Copper-Gold Mine project must be conducted and determined in a manner that is consistent with both. In particular, we argued that the vital importance of lands, territories and resources to Indigenous peoples’ culture, health, well-being, and other rights requires a very high standard of precaution in all decisions potentially affecting Indigenous peoples’ ownership and use of their traditional lands. International human rights law requires governments to meaningfully involve Indigenous peoples in decision-making processes affecting their rights so that their experience, knowledge, expertise, and values can inform the outcome. Where there is potential for significant harm, projects should proceed only with the free, prior, and informed consent of the affected Indigenous peoples. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
In late October, 2013, the review panel concluded that the proposed mine would have “severe” and “irreversible” impacts on the culture and traditional practices of the Tsilhqot’in people. The panel also found a wide range of serious environmental impacts on the lakes, rivers, and wetlands of the area. The panel report cites international human rights standards as one of the factors shaping its determination of the seriousness of the proposal’s potential impacts on the Tsilhqot’in peopleIn a decision released on 26 February 2014, federal Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq said that the significant environmental impacts of the proposed mine could not be justified. 
The Tsilhqot’in people’s ownership over their land and their right to manage it according to their own customs and values was also recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2014. To learn more about our intervention in that case, click here.

0,Why refugees continue to use smugglers,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/refugees-and-migrants/blog-why-refugees-continue-use-smugglers/,"  “You have to understand that no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land,” writes Warsan Shire, a Somali-British poet.    On Friday, March 4, 2016, a Turkish court sentenced two Syrian nationals found guilty in the smuggling of 3 year old Alan Kurdi and his...","  
  
On Friday, March 4, 2016, a Turkish court sentenced two Syrian nationals found guilty in the smuggling of 3 year old Alan Kurdi and his family.  The photograph of Alan’s lifeless body on a beach in Turkey became the catalyst for an outpouring of sympathy for Syrian refugees in Canada and beyond.  Alan’s father, Abdullah must live with the devastating result of joining his family on a tiny boat in the hope they would all find safety.  His wife and two sons, as well as two other people, perished on that journey.  Far from abating, the number of refugees attempting dangerous maritime crossings continues to grow. 
  
Refugees are fleeing desperate situations and will do whatever they must to save their lives.  Often they have no choice but to turn to smugglers to help them escape. 
  
As Canadians watching the global refugee crisis from the safety of our homes, we see the tragic consequences of foul weather and overcrowded boats on inhospitable seas.  In January and February 2016, we have seen news of manufacturers in Turkey providing migrants with fake lifejackets and unseaworthy vessels.  We learned the abominable irony that sometimes these substandard products are made using the labour of child migrants from Syria.  Shire’s terse insight helps to explain what might seem incomprehensible otherwise. 
  
In recent years, our refugee policy has blamed people who try to reach safety in Canada by using smugglers.  The punitive legislation included mandatory detention for refugee claimants who were deemed to have arrived “irregularly” in Canada.  Even for those our country ultimately decided to protect, this law imposed a cruel five-year ban on reunification with their family.  This policy wrongly suggested that migrants who relied on smugglers should be punished and that these harsh measures would deter future refugees from embarking on illicit journeys. 
  
 
  
This policy is wrong:  factually, legally and morally.  Amnesty International Canada has joined with its francophone counterpart, Amnistie internationale Canada, and with the Canadian Council for Refugees to help bring Canadian policy into line with basic human rights principles. 
  
Fact: “Refugees rarely know anything about the policies in the country they arrive in – sometimes they don’t even know where they are going,” affirms the Canadian Council for Refugees. Therefore it simply doesn’t make sense to attempt to deter refugees using policy in the destination country. 
  
Law:  The international law recognizes that sometimes the only way for a refugee to escape is to break national laws – by using a fake passport or by using a smuggler.  The treaty that protects refugees says that refugees who arrive unlawfully should not be punished, as long as they present themselves promptly to authorities and give good reasons for their illegal entry.  Canada is a party to this treaty.  We have a long history of promoting it as the standard for refugee protection.  In fact, the year “2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the people of Canada being awarded the UN’s Nansen Award, the equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize for refugee protection,” says Alex Neve, the Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. 
  
 
  
Moral:  Canadians understand the importance of family. Our values are reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says, “The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.” Supporting the speedy reunification of refugee families is simply the right thing to do.  And the family members of newcomers make significant positive contributions to Canadian society, both economically and socially. The Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (2003) found that immigrants tend to establish themselves more easily if they are supported by families. 
  
On a recent visit to Canada, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon declared he was “very much excited by [the] strong commitment of Prime Minister Trudeau … that Canada is back to the United Nations.”  The Secretary General continued, “I highly commend Prime Minister Trudeau’s decision to accommodate 25,000 Syrian refugees.  … Millions of people they are fleeing because of repressive governments and because of abuse and violation of human rights and life threatening situations.  There is no other way but for them to seek for better opportunities and safer places. ….  Those countries who have a capacity to render their support for these defenseless, voiceless and helpless people, we have to show our compassion.”

My favourite day is April 11, 2007. It’s the day we fell in love. I love my wife because she is simple, honest and very kind to me. I think she loves me because I am a little bit bad :D. We just want a sweet home and a family together. 
I met her at a student book class in 2006. I thought she looked like a boy. And she wasn’t afraid of anyone. She was always debating with our classmates, and talking about why globalization is good.  
Phyoe Phyoe Aung is part of Write for Rights, Amnesty’s global letter-writing marathon. Credit: Nick Chaffe for Amnesty International.  
She’s grown up with politics and activism. When she was 10 months old, her father was arrested after the 1988 uprising, a student protest that was crushed by the military regime. She was 16 when he was released. 
I am very proud of her. She’s the Secretary General of the All Burma Federation Student Union. It’s an important union in our country’s history because it led the call for independence and democracy. That’s why we helped to re-establish it in 2007.  
We had to work in secret, because it was illegal to be a member of the union at that time. We took part in the Saffron Revolution, to protest against the rise in commodity prices. But then we were both arrested, and were in jail for more than three years.

She’s been involved in lots of other campaigns, including a protest against armed conflict in the north of the country. Her dream is for Myanmar to be like a Scandinavian country. She wants a good social welfare system, and health care for everyone. 
In 2014, students from around the country called a meeting about the new National Education Law, which we believe limits academic freedom. She was elected as one of the people to help coordinate action. 
Earlier this year, she helped to organize a march across the country to protest against the law. Nearly 1,000 people took to the streets, including more than 300 students.  
The protestors’ slogans were: “We need democratic education” and “We don’t want a centralized education system”. But when they got near Yangon, the police surrounded them and Phyoe Phyoe Aung was arrested.

We expected it might happen. We had tried to negotiate about the new law with the government, but when that didn’t work we thought it might end badly. She was prepared – she had a mobile phone, some money and a back pack with some food and medicine.  
I felt so sad when I heard. I cried because I couldn’t defend her and I couldn’t be with her. And I was so angry at the government. I miss her now. 
Since then, I have told her to take care of her health and be strong. I tell her I will try my best to release her as soon as possible. 
But the authorities have no tolerance for student activists. They put pressure on universities and professors to monitor them and exclude them from classes. And they put pressure on parents, too. Then, if students still protest in public, the police will arrest them under Article 18 of our law, which bans unauthorized protest.

Now, my wife faces a lengthy trial. She’s very frustrated. They are questioning 47 different defendants in turn, but they still haven’t finished the first person. If it carries on like this, it will take more than three years to get through the whole trial. And if she is sentenced, she could go to jail for more than nine years. 
Today, most people in Myanmar are just interested in the general election. They have forgotten about political prisoners like my wife. That’s why we need to keep the pressure on the government, and tell people what is happening. 
My message for you and Amnesty supporters is to please say loudly to President Thein Sein and his government: “Prison is not the answer for the people who want change.”

Late Friday bombs exploded in Paris. People out for an evening of friendship and entertainment were gunned down without warning. Horror, fear and terror followed. As the carnage abated, the identities of those thought to be responsible for the killings began to come to light. Several were thought to be citizens of Belguim. At least two others are believed to be French. 
But what got the most attention was the revelation that two of the attackers carried Syrian passports. It is believed that they may have recently entered Europe as a part of the massive flow of more than 700,000 refugees who have sought safety in Europe this past year. 
 
Two out of a near million are believed to have participated in a horrible and violent act. This revelation is seen by many as evidence that we must close all borders to refugees. In Canada many petitions quickly found their way onto websites, calling on Canada to immediately withdraw its promise to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees. How can we be sure that we do not allow people into Canada who are planning acts of violence? 
There is no question that Canada and all other nations need to be concerned about random acts of violence and terror attacks. But it does not follow that the refugees who are fleeing terror are those from whom we must be afraid. Indeed, these refugees are themselves fleeing the same terror and fear. Like us, they too are looking for places of safety and security.  
The acts of violence against civilians in Beirut, Baghdad, Ankara, Paris or anywhere else must remind us that now more than ever, Canada needs to be a place of safety for those who are fleeing war. Those who invoke acts of terror meet their goals when we close our doors. That is exactly what they want. 
We must be a part of the solution and one part of that solution is providing safety. We don’t do this blindly. In the selection and resettlement of refugees, Canada undertakes security screening. There are multiple agents involved in this screening including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Canadian visa officers. The screening allows us to identify populations of people who present a low ‘security’ threat. Family units, female headed households, human rights defenders, people with family already in Canada, members of the LGBTI community are all groups of people who pose a significantly reduced threat to others. This type of screening also helps us identify the special vulnerabilities and protection needs of the refugees most at risk. 
Our greatest safety lays in managing and maintaining safe and legal routes for refugees to enter Canada. Our safety lies in upholding and respecting human rights, and ensuring those responsible for human rights abuses are held accountable and brought to justice. Our safety does not lie in turning our backs on those fleeing terror; leaving them to die in a burning house. Our safety lies in responding to the need, putting in place programs and services to select and resettle refugees in Canada and in treating refugees with dignity and respect. 
Refugees live among us now. They are our neighbours all across Canada. They have come from all corners of the world. We are a better country because we have been able to embrace diversity and welcome the ‘other.’  The minute we give in to fear we have given in to terror. We are Paris. We are Beirut, We are Baghdad. We are the world. We are a place of refuge. Refugees are Welcome Here.

But I could not stop my drive wanting to do something that seemed to be impossible for me. I made it happen and reached the finish line with victory on my face. And this could not have happened without a huge support of my donors and my training partner, James Caldwell [pictured next to Ketevan]. This may seem an insignificant contribution, but I believe that every attempt to raise awareness in public about the defence of international human rights helps and from now on I believe that if there is a will, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.”

Marilyn McKim had tacked a sign on my back that read “I’m running for Amnesty International”. Alongside her was her son, Robin, sporting a Stop Torture t-shirt with the Amnesty candle on the back. This promopted several comments from runners passing them: “Oh, that’s a great organization” or “Amnesty has so much integrity.” The best of the day, however, was “I’m a torture survivor. Thank you for running for Amnesty International.”

It was a deadly combination: As increasing numbers of people headed for Europe at the start of 2015, Italy’s successful “Mare Nostrum” (“Our Sea”) Mediterranean search and rescue operation ended, replaced by a much smaller and less effective EU effort. 
Amnesty warned repeatedly of a sharp rise in deadly shipwrecks and dangerously fragile, overcrowded boats setting off from Libya towards Italy. But European governments did little to help – until one tragic weekend in April when over 1,200 people drowned  in two shipwrecks. 
Emergency were talks swiftly followed more ships and planes to patrol the high seas and rescue people in distress. By July, the Mediterranean death toll had dropped dramatically. But without safe and legal routes, the boats keep on coming. Hundreds died during the summer months, and even now, people continue to drown. 
As Europeans prepared for their summer holidays, we warned of the appalling situation meeting asylum-seekers  arriving by sea from Turkey to Greece’s islands of Lesvos  and Kos. The local authorities were either unwilling or incapable of providing basics like food, water, toilets or housing.  
	Local people have been doing what they can to help the newcomers arriving in their thousands, despite tensions running high. But it was evident that the Greek government couldn’t cope with the influx, and that its EU neighbours could do much more to help. 
	But it wasn’t until 2 September, when three-year-old Alan Kurdi from Syria was photographed drowned on a Turkish beach, that the unravelling situation received global attention.  
As early as July, we reported on refugees and migrants taking dangerous routes  to northern Europe via the Balkans – passing through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia towards Serbia and Hungary. 
The world watched in disbelief as riot police at Macedonia’s border with Greece used stun grenades to stop refugees  heading for Serbia. By 21 August, the border had been sealed and military back-up brought in. 
We met many people, including families with children from Syria, who had walked for days and weeks, only to find themselves trapped in a limbo, unable to cross borders legally, seek asylum, or even receive food or find a place to sleep. 
In late August, Hungarian police stopped refugees heading for Austria and Germany from boarding trains. Stuck at Budapest’s main train station , some people simply started to walk north on the motorway, kilometre after kilometre, sleeping under the open sky.

I’m betting that no one who met Garifuna defender and former prisoner of conscience Angel Amílcar Colón Quevedo during his recent visit to Canada will forget his incredible smile or his inspiring words. I certainly won’t! 
 
At meetings in Toronto, Ottawa and Halifax, Angel couldn’t have been clearer about the impact of advocacy work by Amnesty supporters: “If Amnesty International had not made visible in Canada and around the world the torture and imprisonment I suffered for crimes I did not commit, I would never have escaped from that nightmare. I would have been sentenced to more than 70 years in jail, based solely on a “confession” I signed after being tortured and threatened with more torture. The fact that I am free and here before you today is proof that the efforts of Amnesty supporters produce positive results.” 
Angel was accompanied by Luis Tapia Olivares (below right), a lawyer from the Centro Prodh human rights centre in Mexico City, who worked tirelessly amidst a system dominated by corruption and impunity in order to defend Angel against fabricated charges of drug trafficking and organized crime. 
“Securing the release of Angel would have been extremely difficult, likely impossible, without the support of Amnesty International,” said Luis. “By declaring Angel a prisoner of conscience and mobilizing activists around the world to call for his release, Amnesty put Angel out in front of the eyes of the world. International pressure is vital, since Mexican authorities care very much about Mexico’s international image.” 
Angel and Luis came to Canada to take part in Amnesty’s biannual national gathering, and speak at a human rights conference that attracted a large, attentive audience at the spectacular new Halifax Public Library. 
Angel unmasked shocking realities in Mexico by courageously revisiting his traumatic personal experiences; first retelling his feelings when he saw blood-covered floors and heard terrifying screams at the military base to which he was brought. He then recounted how soldiers pinned him down and put a plastic bag over his head, while others jumped on his stomach, making him feel “that my soul was leaving my body”. Amongst other horrors, soldiers poured water over a cloth placed over his mouth so he choked with every breath. 
Nobody was left in any doubt that Amnesty’s campaign to Stop Torture in Mexico remains an urgent priority. “I’m one of the lucky ones,” said Angel. “But there are so many other people suffering torture as security forces seek confessions to show their efforts to rein in drug cartels are being successful. That’s why you must not stop what you are doing because there are so many others in the same situation I was in.” 
Angel also appealed for special attention to the plight of Central Americans forced by economic necessity to migrate through Mexico and face deadly persecution at the hands of drug gangs and state security forces alike. A former president of OFRANEH, an organization that defends the rights of Garifuna communities in Honduras, Angel explained the desperation that results from threats, violence and dispossession of Garifuna lands and livelihoods. “My son had cancer. I felt I had no choice but to leave my home in search of work that would enable me to earn enough to pay for treatment to save my boy’s life,” Angel said. “My son died while I was in prison, deprived of my rights. Other families face unbearable situations too. Migrants from Honduras are killed in Mexico. Others are picked up like me, accused of being criminals, tortured and imprisoned. Many, many families I know in Honduras have lost a loved one.” 
	Angel’s heart rending story got well-deserved coverage by community radio (right) and mainstream media, including the Halifax Chronicle Herald and Radio Canada International.  The public broadcaster also interviewed Luis about escalating human rights violations in Mexico since 2006 when the military were sent out on to Mexican streets with the goal of combatting organized crime. 
Angel and Luis took full advantage of an important opportunity to influence decision makers in Ottawa, when they were invited to testify to a hearing of Parliament’s Subcommittee on International Human Rights (left). The response was palpable. “Parliamentarians from all political parties expressed their concern about what we told them,” said Angel. “It was heartening to see their reaction and to feel their support.” 
Equally heartening was media coverage in Mexico, with more than 30 articles about the hearing, making visible growing Canadian concerns about a human rights crisis that one MP likened to what took place in Argentina during a military dictatorship. 
“What we need is for Canada to speak out forcefully,” concluded Luis. “Canada has a close relationship with Mexico, which gives it weight and influence. We call on Canada to condition its relationship with Mexico on compliance with human rights obligations.” 
Angel’s parting message, true to form, was one of hope and inspiration: “We can’t afford to be paralysed by what is happening. Those who are being attacked, unjustly detained and tortured need our help. All of us can support the efforts of the Centro Prodh and Amnesty International. There is no question that we can make a difference.”

I first met Luis and his family shortly after they arrived in Canada sometime in 1993.  He was a writer and human rights activist from Colombia.  Both he and his wife Diana had been targeted in Colombia because of their work in support of human rights.  Shortly after they arrived in Canada they made a refugee claim. We couldn’t talk much, because his English was poor and my Spanish was even worse; but from the beginning I considered him to be a compañero. My first vivid memory of Luis is a day in December 2003 when Luis, Diana and their friends from the Mennonite church came to our office to share the good news that just an hour or so earlier their refugee claim had been accepted on the spot at their refugee hearing.  There were many hugs and much happiness.  Luis and Diana began to plan to begin their new lives in Canada and quickly made their application to become permanent residents. 
,  
All refugees and new immigrants in Canada must undergo a security check in order to ensure they are admissible to Canada.  Usually this is a paper review.  Luis and Diana were called for an interview in Canada prior to their refugee hearing.  They were asked questions about the groups they associated with in Colombia.  In Luis’ case there were questions about his affiliation with an organization called the Patriotic Union. Luis answered all of the questions truthfully, and assumed the questions were behind him as no concerns were raised at his refugee hearing, and he was recognized as a Convention Refugee.  
,  
In June 2004 Luis and Diana received a letter from the Canadian Border Services Agency inviting them to an interview with Canadian Security Intelligence Services (CSIS) regarding matters of inadmissibility.  They were alarmed, and sought the advice of a lawyer who attended the interview with them. The interview never took place.  Luis’ lawyer asked questions about the purpose of the interview, and asked if there were allegations against Luis.  No answers were provided. The lawyer informed CBSA that Luis would be happy to attend an interview after he is provided with a list of questions and concerns regarding the purpose of the interview. No answer was ever provided.  After years of waiting, Diana became a permanent resident in January 2014. Luis continues to wait for a decision on his application to become a permanent resident. 
,  
Amnesty International has supported Luis throughout his journey in Canada. We have repeatedly raised the concern that the Colombian government has frequently portrayed human rights defenders and organizations they affiliate with in Colombia as subversive organizations with links to ‘guerrilla collaborators’.  It is alarming to think the Canadian government has adopted the view of the Colombian government in Luis’ case. Amnesty International has an extensive record of cases of human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and community organizers being targeted and killed for their human rights activities in Colombia.  It is alarming to think that Luis is being denied residence in Canada for his lawful and peaceful activities as a human rights defender. 
,  
Amnesty International is increasingly concerned that a growing number of individuals are being barred from making refugee claims in Canada as a result of being found inadmissible.  The inadmissibility decisions in Canadian law appear to go far beyond the grounds for exclusion laid out in the United Nations (UN) Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention). 
,  
Amnesty International has, over the years, made repeated submissions to Parliament when new inadmissibility provisions, expressly barring individuals from making refugee claims, were introduced in Canadian law.  We have noted that the provisions often went beyond what is permitted under the Refugee Convention or other international human rights treaties such as the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  We also highlighted on several occasions that the inadmissibility provisions were often drafted in very broad terms which could apply to a wide swathe of individuals.  Amnesty International is also concerned that certain individuals, like Luis, have been held in limbo in Canada for years; with NO decision ever made as to whether or not they are inadmissible to Canada.

He appeared shaken, his body bruised. 
Within hours, a version of the video featuring Rogelio and four of his friends confessing to the crime plastered the TV screens of Ciudad Juárez, in northern Mexico along the border with the USA. 
The town is one of the most violent in the country, infamous for brutal clashes among competing drug cartels and law-enforcement officers. 
The local authorities congratulated themselves for having captured who they said were members of “La Línea”, a local drug cartel who had been terrorizing people in the area for years. They were also blamed for the recent explosion of a car bomb in downtown Juárez. 
Drug dealers behind bars. Problem solved. 
But a few years into the men’s prison term, the real story of how the video was made came to light – and exposed the shocking use of torture that pervades across Mexico. 
Rogelio’s nightmare began on the evening of 10 August 2010. 
He was chatting with some friends on the street when several police officers abruptly parked next to them and got out without uttering a word, pushed Rogelio to the ground, violently kicked him and shoved him and his friends into a van. 
Once at the police station, Rogelio and his friends were locked into small rooms where the brutal interrogation began. 
“Where do you work? Who do you work for?” the officers shouted as the beatings continued, barely leaving any time for him to respond. 
They put a cloth on his face and waterboarded him, while screaming: “You are going to say you work for the drug dealers. Who is your boss? Your friends are already confessing and they are blaming you.” 
Rogelio’s cries for help joined similar screams emanating from the other cells. 
Over the following days, the five men were illegally taken to various police facilities, where the torture only escalated. 
Rogelio was repeatedly told his pregnant wife and child would be killed if he didn’t admit to being part of the drug cartel. A plastic bag was placed over his head several times, in a simulated attempt to suffocate him. He was beaten and kicked so hard that, a year later, 30 marks and scars were still visible on his body. 
“Kill me now! What do you want me to do?,” Rogelio cried. 
Then the camera came in. 
After Rogelio and his four friends “confessed” to being part of “La Línea”, they were taken to the local branch of the Federal Attorney General’s Office where they had to sign a written statement. A public defender who was present at the time told them there was nothing he could do. 
Rogelio’s wife, Mayra, who had been looking for him for days, only learned about her husband’s detention when she saw his TV “confession”. 
“I had been looking for him everywhere, in hospitals, in police stations, in bars. When I went to the prosecutor’s office to report his disappearance someone told me they were on the TV, being accused of many things I knew were not true,” said Mayra. 
After 80 days in pre-trial detention, the men were finally brought before a judge where they retracted their confessions and reported having been tortured. 
To no avail. They were charged with being part of a criminal gang and possessing arms and drugs and locked up in high-security federal prisons far away from home. 
The charges against the five men were eventually dropped after forensic experts confirmed that the only shred of evidence against them, their confessions, had been extracted under torture. 
Since the ground-breaking Convention against Torture entered into force 30 years ago, confessions extracted under torture are banned. The Convention was ratified by Mexico in 1986, and since 1991, a Federal Law has prohibited torture. 
“I always said I had nothing to do with that car bomb, but they kept beating and torturing us. I then had to suffer three years and seven months in jail because of that. Three years and seven months far away from my family, feeling helpless, not being able to see my children growing up. It was very painful,” said Rogelio, now a free man. 
Rogelio, who now lives in Ciudad Juárez with his wife and two small children, still struggles to overcome the torture he went through. 
But his ordeal is far from unusual. 
Torture in Mexico is like a virus of epidemic proportions. 
Beatings, fake asphyxiation and sexual abuse are routinely used by the security forces to punish detainees or extract confessions. According to a poll commissioned by Amnesty International, 64 per cent of Mexicans are scared they might suffer it if they are taken into custody. 
A report published by the organization also revealed a 600 per cent rise in the number of cases reported to the National Human Rights Commission, between 2003 and 2013. And this institution only detects a small fraction of all possible torture cases in the country. 
Torture is so pervasive that anyone can be a target. But being poor or living in a marginalized neighbourhood may put you at higher risk as police officers and prosecutors tend to assume that you have fewer resources to defend yourself. 
“Mexico’s police and soldiers are so desperate to find anyone to blame for the crimes committed by unscrupulous gangs that they seem not to think twice before arresting someone and getting a confession at any cost. There seem to be no limits,” said Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
Most of those responsible for inflicting or authorizing torture never face justice: only seven torturers have ever been convicted in federal courts. 
But while thousands try to cope with the consequences of torture, the Mexican authorities are turning a blind eye to this epidemic. 
Gravely flawed investigations by prosecutors and human rights commissions routinely under-report or dismiss well-founded claims. On paper, Mexico has adhered to the highest international standards in relation to forensic examination of alleged torture victims for over a decade. In reality, forensic examinations tend to be poor, late, re-traumatizing and biased against the victim, as in Rogelio’s case. 
But he was one of the lucky few who could contact independent forensic experts. Their expert report tore apart the case against him paving the way for his release without charge. So far, no one has been brought to justice for torturing Rogelio and he has not received any compensation.

He appeared shaken, his body bruised. 
,  
Within hours, a version of the video featuring Rogelio and four of his friends confessing to the crime plastered the TV screens of Ciudad Juárez, in northern Mexico along the border with the USA. 
,  
The town is one of the most violent in the country, infamous for brutal clashes among competing drug cartels and law-enforcement officers. 
,  
The local authorities congratulated themselves for having captured who they said were members of “La Línea”, a local drug cartel who had been terrorizing people in the area for years. They were also blamed for the recent explosion of a car bomb in downtown Juárez. 
,  
Drug dealers behind bars. Problem solved. 
,  
But a few years into the men’s prison term, the real story of how the video was made came to light – and exposed the shocking use of torture that pervades across Mexico. 
,  
,  
Rogelio’s nightmare began on the evening of 10 August 2010. 
,  
He was chatting with some friends on the street when several police officers abruptly parked next to them and got out without uttering a word, pushed Rogelio to the ground, violently kicked him and shoved him and his friends into a van. 
,  
Once at the police station, Rogelio and his friends were locked into small rooms where the brutal interrogation began. 
,  
“Where do you work? Who do you work for?” the officers shouted as the beatings continued, barely leaving any time for him to respond. 
,  
They put a cloth on his face and waterboarded him, while screaming: “You are going to say you work for the drug dealers. Who is your boss? Your friends are already confessing and they are blaming you.” 
,  
Rogelio’s cries for help joined similar screams emanating from the other cells. 
,  
Over the following days, the five men were illegally taken to various police facilities, where the torture only escalated. 
,  
Rogelio was repeatedly told his pregnant wife and child would be killed if he didn’t admit to being part of the drug cartel. A plastic bag was placed over his head several times, in a simulated attempt to suffocate him. He was beaten and kicked so hard that, a year later, 30 marks and scars were still visible on his body. 
,  
“Kill me now! What do you want me to do?,” Rogelio cried. 
,  
Then the camera came in. 
,  
After Rogelio and his four friends “confessed” to being part of “La Línea”, they were taken to the local branch of the Federal Attorney General’s Office where they had to sign a written statement. A public defender who was present at the time told them there was nothing he could do. 
,  
Rogelio’s wife, Mayra, who had been looking for him for days, only learned about her husband’s detention when she saw his TV “confession”. 
,  
“I had been looking for him everywhere, in hospitals, in police stations, in bars. When I went to the prosecutor’s office to report his disappearance someone told me they were on the TV, being accused of many things I knew were not true,” said Mayra. 
,  
After 80 days in pre-trial detention, the men were finally brought before a judge where they retracted their confessions and reported having been tortured. 
,  
To no avail. They were charged with being part of a criminal gang and possessing arms and drugs and locked up in high-security federal prisons far away from home. 
,  
The charges against the five men were eventually dropped after forensic experts confirmed that the only shred of evidence against them, their confessions, had been extracted under torture. 
,  
Since the ground-breaking Convention against Torture entered into force 30 years ago, confessions extracted under torture are banned. The Convention was ratified by Mexico in 1986, and since 1991, a Federal Law has prohibited torture. 
,  
“I always said I had nothing to do with that car bomb, but they kept beating and torturing us. I then had to suffer three years and seven months in jail because of that. Three years and seven months far away from my family, feeling helpless, not being able to see my children growing up. It was very painful,” said Rogelio, now a free man. 
,  
,  
Rogelio, who now lives in Ciudad Juárez with his wife and two small children, still struggles to overcome the torture he went through. 
,  
But his ordeal is far from unusual. 
,  
Torture in Mexico is like a virus of epidemic proportions. 
,  
Beatings, fake asphyxiation and sexual abuse are routinely used by the security forces to punish detainees or extract confessions. According to a poll commissioned by Amnesty International, 64 per cent of Mexicans are scared they might suffer it if they are taken into custody. 
,  
A report published by the organization also revealed a 600 per cent rise in the number of cases reported to the National Human Rights Commission, between 2003 and 2013. And this institution only detects a small fraction of all possible torture cases in the country. 
,  
Torture is so pervasive that anyone can be a target. But being poor or living in a marginalized neighbourhood may put you at higher risk as police officers and prosecutors tend to assume that you have fewer resources to defend yourself. 
,

A timely conference on Wednesday reminded us that as debate swirls about new national security measures in Canada, vital lessons have emerged over the past decade about protecting human rights. 
In the wake of last week’s attack in Ottawa the government is rolling out proposed changes to Canada’s security laws and practices. We don’t yet know the full extent. 
	On Wednesday, a remarkable group of judges, lawyers, journalists, activists, former diplomats, academics and community leaders came together in Ottawa. We were joined by individuals whose lives have been turned upside down by human rights violations associated with national security investigations, charges, arrest and imprisonment. 
	The conference marked the decade since the ground-breaking judicial inquiry into the shocking treatment of Canadian citizen Maher Arar was established in 2004. That inquiry found that Canadian actions, negligence and dysfunction had set Maher Arar up for grave human rights violations, including torture, in Syria. 
	When it comes to security and human rights this has been an impressive decade for Canadian judges. 
	Yesterday’s conference featured a panel made up of Dennis O’Connor, the retired Ontario Court of Appeal Justice who headed the Arar Inquiry, alongside two retired Supreme Court of Canada Justices, Frank Iacobucci who conducted an inquiry into the overseas torture of Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou-Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin, and John Major, who presided over the inquiry into the Air India terrorist bombing. 
	Among them, those three senior judges spent eight years investigating, reaching findings and issuing prudent recommendations regarding sensitive aspects of national security in Canada. 
	They are not alone. The past decade has seen numerous court rulings upholding key human rights principles in the midst of national security secrecy and global cooperation. 
	The Supreme Court ventured into the world of Guantánamo Bay, twice, with its Omar Khadr rulings. The Court also grappled with the controversial immigration security certificate system twice, overthrowing it in the 2007 Charkaoui case and upholding a revised form in the 2014 Harkat ruling. 
	The Federal Court slammed the government for withholding a passport from a Canadian citizen and torture victim, stranded abroad and facing vague security-related accusations, in the 2009 Abdelrazik judgment. 
	And on goes the list. 
	What came through loud and clear at yesterday’s conference, though, was that strong findings, important recommendations and precedent-setting rulings from judges have been matched by almost equal failure of government to comply and implement. 
	Maher Arar received compensation and an apology. But a proposal for strengthened national security oversight has been ignored for eight years. And a recommendation that Canada never share information with a foreign government if it is likely to cause torture has been deliberately flouted with a ministerial direction allowing precisely that. 
	The response to the Iacobucci Inquiry has been dismal. A lengthy list of wrongdoing, elaborated by a senior judge, has been disregarded. Three men who experienced torture abroad, tolerated and even facilitated by Canada, are lost in a contentious lawsuit instead. 
	The risk to all our fundamental freedoms – to our democracy – is real. 
	It is not enough simply to assert that Canada’s national security practices will take account of human rights. It needs concrete and precise action. 
	There must be redress for the many individuals who have suffered security-related human rights violations, as confirmed by some of Canada’s most senior judges. 
	And very significantly, review and oversight of agencies and departments involved in national security must be strengthened. The urgency of doing so has mounted since Justice O’Connor’s 2006 proposed comprehensive and integrated model. 
	It would be perilous to move ahead with another round of national security law reform unless past human rights violations are remedied and Canada’s national security review and oversight gap is – finally – addressed. Otherwise, what exactly are we protecting?

Although it is talked about little, torture is the Phillipines’ dirty, open secret. It is endemic. Even though banned in Philippine law, and even though the country has signed up to all the right international treaties on ending torture, this has amounted to little more than paper promises. 
Amnesty International has received numerous and harrowing reports of the widespread use of torture and other cruel and inhuman practices by security forces. 
And the police are woefully equipped to address the issue. With around a quarter of a million police officers and soldiers combined, according to the President himself, the Philippines has one of the smallest police to population ratios in the world. This means that the national police has been dependent on poorly trained but sometimes armed police auxiliaries. On the ground, police officers rely on informants and “assets” to do their policing – and sometimes extra-legal activities. 
The police and their auxiliaries are, in fact, the heart of the problem – it is in police detention facilities that torture is most often used. Suspects in common criminal cases, repeat offenders, out-of-favour police informants and political activists are among those who are at particular risk. The methods used range from beatings with metal bars, to burnings with cigarette butts, electrocution, water-boarding and suffocation with plastic bags. 
Compounding the problem is the almost complete impunity that the police enjoy. Police officers and their auxiliaries get away with torture almost as a standard operating procedure. Five years after the Philippines passed the Anti-Torture Act, not one single person has been convicted of torture. 
The now infamous “Wheel of Torture” discovered in Laguna province in January this year – where police used a roulette wheel to decide how detainees would be tortured – is an example of how confident police are of getting away with the practice. But as despicable as it is for police officers to turn torture into entertainment, the discovery in Laguna is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Take for example the case of Alfreda Disbarro, a 32-year old mother of two from Parañaque City. In October last year, police accused Alfreda of being a drug dealer. In fact, she is a former police informant who wanted out from working with the local police. Once police had taken her to their headquarters, they pinned her to a wall, repeatedly punched her, poked their fingers into her eyes, slapped her and beat her with a wooden baton and forced a mop into her mouth. 
Over the following days Alfreda was in terrible pain. During this period she was photographed with 300 pesos and a sachet of drugs, and told to sign a blank sheet of paper. 
	Alfreda’s case would be just one of many if it wasn’t for the attention it has received thanks to campaigning by international human rights activists, including Amnesty International. Apparently shamed by an international letter writing campaign, the police in May this year started an investigation into the case by its own Internal Affairs Service. It remains to be seen what comes of the investigation, but it does offer a small ray of hope that the culture of impunity around torture could end. 
On July 23, another torture victim was released from prison. Fernando Obedencio had been detained for nine years on drugs possession charges, until a judge ruled that the court dismiss the charges as they were apparently fabricated. With Alfreda still behind bars, this is a chilling reminder of the fate that could await her and the many others who languish in Philippine jails for years while awaiting trial. 
This year, Amnesty International launched a major new global campaign to Stop Torture across the globe once and for all, in which the Philippines is one of our focus countries. We chose it not just because of the scale of the problem here, but also because there is real opportunity for change. 
President Aquino now has a chance to show that he agrees with us. In order to show that he is serious about tackling the wider problem of abuse of power, the President must address not just corruption, but also grave human rights violations. He must ensure that the laws banning torture are strictly enforced, in particular by security forces. There is also an urgent need to address the impunity around torture – all complaints of torture must be thoroughly and impartially investigated. 
The courts, the Department of Justice and government agencies mandated to ensure accountability for the abuse of power must be given their marching orders: it is time to stop torture; it is time to hold torturers to account. 
During the President’s State of the Nation Address in July 2014 he said: “The future we desire is on the horizon: one where justice reigns supreme, and where no one will be left behind.” 
These lofty words have to be backed with action. In making torture one of his highest priorities, he could put an end to perhaps the gravest abuse of power of all.

	On June 14, under the banner of ‘My Door is Open for Refugees,’ Amnesty members and friends walked in support of refugees in Toronto. The streets of Toronto (at least those around Church and Wellesley) were alive with chants which could be heard many blocks away. 
The walk in Toronto took us to the 519 Church Street Community Centre, an organization with a long history of supporting LGBTI refugees. We left a rainbow banner with Karlene Williams Clarke, an outreach coordinator at the Centre, in recognition of the tremendous work being done at the Centre on behalf of refugees. 
The walk was a part of a larger action coordinated by the Canadian Council for Refugees, which encouraged groups across Canada to show solidarity and support for refugees on or around World Refugee Day.  
Support to refugees and their right to seek asylum is more critical now than ever before. On World Refugee Day, June 20, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reminded us that the intolerance that is often at the root of internal displacement and refugee flows is also present in some of the countries that refugees flee to. Instead of finding empathy and understanding, refugees are often met with mistrust or scorn. Sadly in 2014 the number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people worldwide has, for the first time in the post-World War II era, exceeded 50 million people. This massive increase was driven mainly by the war in Syria. 
Not since World War II has it been so important for all countries of the world to keep their doors open for refugees. On June 13 I attended an event hosted by the Syrian Canadian Foundation for Humanity to promote the need for resettlement and protection for Syrian refugees. A small group of 30 or so people (mostly Syrians) participated in the event, and many wondered what they need to do to make the world care about their families and friends who are living under siege or have fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries. 
World Pride followed on the heels of World Refugee Day, where well over one million people celebrated achievements in obtaining rights for LGBTI people around the world and recognized countries in which so much more work still needs to be done. Not all LGBTI refugees will find protection when they need it, and many countries do not recognize asylum claims which are based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Amnesty members across Canada need to continue to find ways to help keep Canada’s doors open to refugees. While walking under a banner or posting a status update on Facebook may not change the world, these messages help to convey messages of support in a world which is increasingly hostile towards refugees. “My Door Is Open for Refugees” banners are available from the Toronto Office of Amnesty International.

On June 13 I attended an event hosted by the Syrian Canadian Foundation for Humanity to promote the need for resettlement and protection for Syrian refugees. A small group of 30 or so people (mostly Syrians) participated in the event, and many wondered what they need to do to make the world care about their families and friends who are living under siege or have fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries. 
,  
World Pride followed on the heels of World Refugee Day, where well over one million people celebrated achievements in obtaining rights for LGBTI people around the world and recognized countries in which so much more work still needs to be done. Not all LGBTI refugees will find protection when they need it, and many countries do not recognize asylum claims which are based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 
,  
Amnesty members across Canada need to continue to find ways to help keep Canada’s doors open to refugees. While walking under a banner or posting a status update on Facebook may not change the world, these messages help to convey messages of support in a world which is increasingly hostile towards refugees. “My Door Is Open for Refugees” banners are available from the Toronto Office of Amnesty International.

Documenting human rights abuses is our daily work. Sometimes, however, we unearth evidence of such depravity that it leaves even our hardened investigators almost lost for words. 
This has been the case with our revelations of war crimes from Nigeria today. The materials come from a recent mission by an Amnesty International research team which investigated widespread human rights abuses in Borno state, a region which gained worldwide notoriety following the kidnapping in April of more than 240 school girls by the armed group, Boko Haram. 
Amnesty International has been documenting and highlighting human rights abuses perpetrated by both Boko Haram and government security forces in northeast Nigeria for some time – those abuses were a key theme of a trip I made to Nigeria in 2012. But this latest research has uncovered incontrovertible evidence – including video footage – of extrajudicial executions and other serious violations by the Nigerian military and Boko Haram, on a truly horrifying scale. 
Some of the video footage, images and testimonies collated have now been verified and an edited version of some of it will be released today. Graphic evidence of multiple war crimes is not easy to watch. But for President Goodluck Jonathan, his government ministers and military commanders it should be compulsory viewing. They should watch not despite it being hard to watch – they should watch because it is so hard to watch. 
The footage includes deeply disturbing images of what appear to be members of the Nigerian armed forces and Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), a state-sponsored militia, executing detainees. One of the videos shows 16 young men seated in a line. One by one they are called forward and forced to lie down in front of a pit where their throats are slit and their bodies dumped unceremoniously into a mass grave. 
The footage shows five young men killed in this way. The fate of the others is not captured on film but eyewitness accounts confirmed that nine of them had their throats cut while the others were shot dead. 
These were among the over 600 extrajudicial executions that had taken place in and around Maiduguri on March 14 after the Nigerian military went on a rampage following Boko Haram’s attack on the military detention centre in Giwa Barracks earlier that day. 
Other footage, taken in late July 2013, shows a mass arbitrary arrest of alleged Boko Haram members by the Nigerian military and CJTF – a common operation known as a “screening”. Arriving in the town of Bama in the morning, the security forces rounded all the men up in the central market, forcing them to strip. About 300 of them were released, up to 35 were accused of being Boko Haram members and ordered to lie down. Footage shows them being beaten with sticks and machetes before being loaded onto a military vehicle. They were taken away to the local military barracks and on July 29 they were all brought to their communities and shot dead, their corpses dumped around the town. 
This was not the first time that the population of Bama had been “screened”, nor is it just the military who inflicts such abuses on the inhabitants. Over the years, Boko Haram has launched a series of deadly attacks against Bama, apparently in retaliation for what the armed group deems to be the locals’ cooperation with the Nigerian military. 
Amnesty International has unearthed footage of the aftermath of Boko Haram’s most deadly assault on the town in which they killed nearly 100 people over the course of several hours on February 19. The video shows scores of corpses wrapped for burial. 
 
Thus, the people of Bama are caught between the ruthless attacks by Boko Haram and the routine serious violations by the Nigerian security forces. That experience is mirrored in towns and villages across Borno state. It is little wonder that so many have fled or are living in a state of constant fear. 
As the bloody insurgency waged by Boko Haram since 2009 has intensified, so, too, has the brutality of the Nigerian government’s response. Rural communities caught in the middle are terrorised by Boko Haram, on the one hand, and by the very military whose duty it is to protect them, on the other. 
More than 4,000 Nigerians, the majority of them civilians, have been killed by both sides in this year alone. This includes the 600 people extrajudicially executed by the Nigerian military in Maiduguri in March. Last month, the town of Damboa fell to Boko Haram and in a separate incident in Kaduna state, 12 people appear to have been killed while in custody by the Nigerian military after being arrested during an apparently peaceful protest in which 21 other protesters were also killed after the military opened fire on them. 
The gruesome footage from northeastern Nigeria is deeply troubling. More disturbing still is that these incidents of murderous brutality are only the tip of a larger iceberg. Our research suggests that the extrajudicial executions are part of a pattern of human rights violations by the Nigerian military and its civilian “helpers”, the CJTF. 
As today’s revelations make clear, an immediate, impartial, independent, and thorough investigation is urgently needed to look into these serious and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in northeastern Nigeria. 
The Nigerian government must publicly condemn such crimes and ensure an end to the human rights violations being carried out by the Nigerian military, including arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and extrajudicial executions. Above all, we must not see the simple denial of responsibility that we have seen far too often before. 
“When two elephants fight, it is the grass that is trampled,” says an old African proverb. Nowhere is that truer than in northeastern Nigeria today. The people there have no one they can trust and they have nowhere they can turn. In the words of another proverb, “They have nothing left but their eyes to cry with.”

Amnesty International research shows that torture and other ill-treatment continue to be an issue in many countries facing real or perceived national security threats, including terrorism. 
	However, the focus on torture and other ill-treatment in what the US authorities then called the “war on terror” at the beginning of the century may have skewed the global picture. What our research also clearly shows is that most victims of torture and other ill-treatment worldwide are not dangerous terrorists but rather poor, marginalized and disempowered criminal suspects who unfortunately seldom draw the attention of the media and public opinion, either nationally or globally. 
	Real or perceived political “enemies” of the government who have never carried a bomb or any other weapon, including human rights defenders, opposition politicians and journalists, are also frequent victims of torture. 
 
This means that yes, torture continues in anti-terrorism contexts, but even here torture is mostly practised as a means of dehumanizing enemies – real life doesn’t look like “24” or “Zero Dark Thirty.”   
	And globally most victims are tortured not because they’re terrorists but because they’re poor, or different, or dare to disagree with the government. Whatever the motive, torture and other ill-treatment are prohibited absolutely, and never justified, no matter who you are or what you’ve done. 
Torture is a primitive and blunt instrument of obtaining information. States have a huge variety of ways to collect information on crimes – both past and planned – without losing their humanity. In particular, humane questioning techniques have proved to be efficient in obtaining information on crimes without the devastating personal, societal and legal consequences. 
Torture doesn’t come in levels. 
	It is defined legally as an act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person to punish or obtain information. No torture is “lite”. 
	All forms of torture are despicable and illegal – including electric shocks, beatings, rape, humiliation, mock executions, burning, sleep deprivation, mock drowning, long hours in contorted positions, use of pincers, drugs and dogs. Sadly, all of these are widely used in countries across the world.   
No. Torture is never legal or acceptable. Countries that currently fail to punish it by law are violating internationally agreed standards.   
	In legal terms, the absolute prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment is “non-derogable” – that is, it cannot be relaxed even in times of emergency. The prohibition has achieved such a strong global consensus that it has become binding even on states which have not joined the relevant human rights treaties. 
	But many governments today continue to torture for a host of reasons, mainly because governments benefit from torture – or believe that they do – and because those responsible rarely face justice. Much more needs to be done to end this despicable practice.	  
Over the past five years Amnesty International has reported on torture or other ill-treatment in 141 countries and from every world region. 
	While in some of these countries torture might be the exception, in others it is systemic, and even one case of torture or other ill-treatment is unacceptable. 
	Amnesty International’s evidence and global research combined with more than five decades of documenting and campaigning against this abuse, reveals that, torture is still flourishing.

As soon he set one foot inside the small room at a police detention centre in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, Forensic Doctor Duarte Vieira was shocked. He had never seen anything as bad – and he had seen plenty. 
Amongst the 45 men, women and children held in a space originally built for six people, he saw a man with a rotting bullet wound on his foot. And then another. And a third one. 
The wound on the ankle of a fourth man had gone untreated for so long that his foot was literally decomposing; attached to the leg by a thread of skin. 
Dr. Vieira immediately knew this was a form of torture used to punish prisoners. 
“I never thought I was going to see anything like that in a living human being. People were shot on their feet before being interrogated as a way of showing them what to expect next,” he told Amnesty International. 
Torture?	Portuguese born Dr. Duarte Vieira, one of world’s leading medical forensic experts, was documenting reports of torture in detention centres in Nigeria as part of a 2007 mission by the then UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Novak. 
Since then, he has visited detention centres across the world, documenting the use of torture and other ill-treatment for a variety of reasons, including as a form of punishment or to extract “confessions”. 
His conclusions are used as evidence in courts, asylum claims and official reports. 
“We use medical techniques to advance justice. We interpret the evidence and try to establish all facts. The expert acts as the glasses of the judge and helps him make a decision based on the clearest possible version of reality,” Dr. Vieira explained. 
During the visits he examines and interviews detainees about their traumatic experiences. 
“Sometimes the detainees don’t say anything because they are scared, but most of the time I only have to look at them to see something has happened because of the marks on their bodies, because of the way they act and even how they talk.” 
Dr. Vieira documents the size, colour, depth and orientation of injuries in order to establish if they were caused by an accident, the result of a medical treatment, the natural consequence of a disease or a wound inflicted by another person. Everything is recorded in detail. 
A private interview with the detainee usually helps fill in any gaps. 
“I have to interpret the evidence and evaluate all possible causes. When you see a burn or a scar, for example, it does not mean that the person was tortured. The mark could have been an accident, or an old injury or it could be self-inflicted so I have to evaluate if what the detainee says is consistent with what he is showing. If someone says, for example, that he was injured 15 days ago and I can see the scar is seven months old, then it doesn’t correspond. Or if a prison guard tells me that the prisoner fell down the stairs and I can see that the injuries are not typical of that.” 
“If I see a detainee with a burn mark and he tells me it was done with a hot iron to make him confess and I see only one detainee with that type of mark, I cannot say he was tortured. I can say it is a possibility but I cannot exclude that he was burned accidentally. However, if I see the same pattern of burns in several detainees then I can tell that it is unlikely all detainees would burn their backs accidentally so it is a pattern that shows me it is quite likely they were tortured.” 
Science of justice	Just like Dr. Vieira, medical experts across the world have the challenging job of establishing if an individual has been tortured, otherwise ill-treated, or not. When they exist, medical reports usually make an important part of a legal case against a particular government or are crucial factors when an individual applies for asylum in another country. 
Experts are trained for years in forensic science – a branch of medicine that, among other thing, deals with identifying signs of abuse in individuals and in human remains. 
However, physical injuries are only half of the story. With torture techniques becoming more sophisticated across the world, perpetrators aim to leave few, if any, physical marks on detainees and often rely on psychological torture instead. 
Techniques used often include sleep deprivation, humiliation, mock executions, threats of abuse and sensory deprivation, amongst many others. Proving they were practised is difficult. 
Dr. Juliet Cohen is Head of Doctors at Freedom from Torture, a UK-based organization that focuses on the treatment and rehabilitation of torture survivors. 
She says evaluating whether someone has suffered psychological torture is usually extremely challenging. 
“We evaluate how individuals conduct themselves, their behaviour, how they speak and how that changes during the course of the examination. The information that they give, the things they find very difficult to talk about, the impact that the torture has had on them. I ask a lot of questions about how they get through the day and particularly revealing can be questions about their sleep, what happens at night time. Torture might not leave any physical evidence and people might not fall into very neat categories for diagnosis so it is very important to get a very detailed picture of what happened and how it has affected them,” Dr. Cohen explained. 
One of the tools used by forensic doctors is the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, known as the Istanbul Protocol. 
The Protocol, issued in 1999, contains detailed standards and procedures on how healthcare professionals can recognize and document symptoms of torture and other ill-treatment, so that their findings may then be used as evidence in court. 
Dr. Vieira agrees that torture techniques have evolved to become more sophisticated but experts have ways of determining if an individual has been tortured 
“Most forms of torture are designed not to leave any kind of marks in the body but there are ways to know if someone has been tortured. Torture survivors would usually describe particular experiences, the room they were tortured in, the colour of the walls, the light in the roof, the clothes of the torturer. Also when several people describe the same story that shows me a pattern that is repeated and that shows that the practice is happening.” 
Dr. Vieira is hopeful about the future. He thinks achievements in forensic medicine are key for the advancement of justice, which is what he works for every day. 
“We will never eradicate torture but at least I hope that those responsible will face justice. Today the situation is much better than it was 20 years ago and I hope that today it is much worse than it will be in 20 years.”

Torture might not leave any physical evidence and people might not fall into very neat categories for diagnosis so it is very important to get a very detailed picture of what happened and how it has affected them,” Dr. Cohen explained. 
,  
One of the tools used by forensic doctors is the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, known as the Istanbul Protocol. 
,  
The Protocol, issued in 1999, contains detailed standards and procedures on how healthcare professionals can recognize and document symptoms of torture and other ill-treatment, so that their findings may then be used as evidence in court. 
,  
Dr. Vieira agrees that torture techniques have evolved to become more sophisticated but experts have ways of determining if an individual has been tortured 
,  
“Most forms of torture are designed not to leave any kind of marks in the body but there are ways to know if someone has been tortured. Torture survivors would usually describe particular experiences, the room they were tortured in, the colour of the walls, the light in the roof, the clothes of the torturer. Also when several people describe the same story that shows me a pattern that is repeated and that shows that the practice is happening.” 
,  
Dr. Vieira is hopeful about the future. He thinks achievements in forensic medicine are key for the advancement of justice, which is what he works for every day. 
,  
“We will never eradicate torture but at least I hope that those responsible will face justice. Today the situation is much better than it was 20 years ago and I hope that today it is much worse than it will be in 20 years.”

Inspired by a series of hyper-real images created exclusively for us by Japan-based artist Hikaru Cho, we wanted you to show us what the campaign means to you. 
Hundreds of you from every region in the world came back to us with selfies, art work and more, which we judged based on their originality, effort and relevance. It was a tough choice, but here are our winners, who will be receiving signed copies of Hikaru Cho’s art work in the coming weeks. 
To see all submissions, go to http://mb-mr.tumblr.com/ and while you’re there why not upload your own image either showing your solidarity with the campaign or sharing updates of your My Body My Rights campaign actions. 
  
When we launched My Body My Rights, we also asked you to sign our petition calling on world leaders to protect the sexual and reproductive rights of young people everywhere. 280,000 of you from almost every country in the world signed. And your calls did not go unheard. 
In April, we handed in that petition to high level officals at the UN Commission on Population and Development. The Commission was making decisions on sexual and reproductive rights that would affect the lives of everyone, especially young people, now and far into the future. 
Negotiations lasted a week and were intense. But in the end, governments reaffirmed that sexual and reproductive rights are central to social justice and world development. 
The Commission called on all governments to respect, protect, promote and fulfil all human rights, including gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. It also recognized the need for universal access to quality sexual and reproductive health services and the right to sexuality education. 
But world leaders failed to agree to end discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And access to safe abortion services was limited to countries where abortion is not against the law. 
Much remains to be done. 
Over the next two years, My Body My Rights will be campaigning on vital issues like these. Join us.

In November, a federally-appointed environmental assessment panel concluded that the proposed New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine would have “severe” and “irreversible” impacts on the culture and traditional practices of the Tsilhqot’in people. The panel also found a wide range of serious environmental impacts on the lakes, rivers and wetlands. 
In a decision released on February 26, federal Environment Minister said that the significant environmental impacts of the proposed mine could not be justified. 
This is the second time that the federal government has rejected plans by Taseko Mines to open a mine near Teztan Biny or Fish Lake in Tsilhqot’in Territory. 
Amnesty International intervened in the latest review to argue that any assessment of a project’s potential impacts on Indigenous peoples must be consistent with the high standard of protection for Indigenous rights under the Canadian Constitutional and international human rights law.

Just a couple of days before the Winter Olympic Games start in Sochi, an activist was arrested. Sadly, such arrests are not unusual in Russia, but the timing of this particular arrest sent a chilling message across Russian civil society. 
The environmentalist Yevgeny Vitishko was planning on traveling to Sochi today but was stopped by police, convicted of “petty hooliganism” and sentenced to 15 days in administrative detention. His crime? According to Russian authorities he cursed while standing at a bus stop. 
When I heard the news about Vitishko’s arrest I was in the middle of a conversation with Semyon Simonov. A lawyer for the human rights organization Memorial in Sochi, he defends the rights of migrant workers. 
Many of the people involved in the construction of the Sochi Olympic stadiums and hotels have not been paid for their hard work. After the construction ended, many of them were pressured to leave Russia, while others were forcibly deported. Simonov spoke to members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) about four months ago about the violations of migrant workers’ rights and handed the IOC delegation a list with 700 names of people whose rights were seriously violated. Since then, Simonov has not been contacted by the IOC. Only a dozen of the people on the list have been paid.     
Simonov also spoke about how hard is it to organize demonstrations in Sochi even outside the context of the Olympic Games. 
“You ask [for] an approval for a demonstration (as required by Russian law), that is followed by an invitation to the mayor’s office, where the local authorities try to persuade you into calling off your event. If that does not work it quite often turns out that a local school is organizing a festivity or sports day on that specific date and time at that very location. Then a different location for the protest is proposed by the authorities. And it just happens to be a park on the outskirts of the town, where you can hardly be heard or seen by anyone.” 
Instead of being in Sochi during the Winter Olympics, Vitishko will be spending the next 15 days in administrative detention and Sochi2014 has its first prisoner of conscience. 
During these 15 days he cannot talk about the environmental damage caused by during the constructions of the Olympic infrastructure or other issues that don’t fit into Putin’s Olympic show. Vitishko’s case is another clear example of the harassment against civil society activism in the run-up to the Olympics. It’s a simple and horrifying message from the Russian authorities to the country’s civil society: If you don’t fall in line, you will be next.

,  
The recent acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida has understandably upset many. The facts as known broadly would to most people seem to indicate that the acquittal or at the very least the law, is unjust. 
,  
Certainly the “Stand Your Ground” law, which takes self-defence to a confusing extreme (pre-emptive strike?), has resulted in many confusing verdicts (see this good analysis from the Tampa Bay Times). It pales in comparison to two other, extremely troubling aspects of Florida’s legal system: 
,  
,  
,  
,  
That means, despite the worst record on convicting the right person, Florida is accelerating the process to kill those people who may well be innocent. 
,  
The logic is backwards. Even those who agree with capital punishment generally agree that innocent people should not be executed. However what can one expect in a system  that gets it wrong not only in death penalty cases; That claims the best way to prevent a crime is to commit the same crime in public (I.e., murder the “murderer”). The verdict in the Zimmerman trial to some, will also say that you needn’t actually be a threat – just a perceived threat, for your life to be worthless. That is the difference between Stand Your Ground and common law self defence. That is the difference between allowing proper appeals and recklessly pushing for a state execution while proper doubt over guilt continues. 
,  
It would be smug of us to imagine that in Canada we are immune from wrongful convictions. There are countless examples even in recent trials, of innocent people convicted. But one safeguard we do have over Florida is that at least in Canada, we will never again face the prospect of executing an innocent person. 
,  
No justice system is infallible, Trayvon’s death has exposed one aspect of Florida’s flaws to many. The underside is just as gruesome. Regardless of how certain you are of the guilt of one person, the fact is the same system will convict an innocent person too. How much is your desire for revenge worth: is it worth the life of the next innocent person convicted?

Though family planning was a challenge to access as an adolescent it was available, and as an adult it has always been easy to obtain. When I started a family it was my choice to do so. I received high quality pre-natal care, and when my child decided to enter the world earlier than anticipated, the health care system took good care of us both. I know that I have the right to make decisions about my body and I have always been able to freely exercise those rights. 
As Amnesty International Canada’s campaigner on women’s rights it is my wish that my experience be shared by all women but sadly it is not. In Canada, many women and girls continue to face barriers in fully exercising their sexual and reproductive rights. Sexuality education and family planning may be available, but if you are a new immigrant, Aboriginal, youth, LGBT, rural dweller, have a disability, or live in poverty or on the street, these services may be difficult to access or not designed to meet your needs. A recent report by Statistics Canada noted that the rate of sexual assaults is not decreasing, and that the most marginalized women in Canadian society, those who are least likely to have access to services to help them claim their sexual and reproductive rights, are most likely to become victims of sexual violence. 
The challenges that women and girls outside Canada face are staggering. For example, Latifah, a 14-year-old girl from Indonesia, was accused of adultery by the local police when she went to report she had been raped. Louisa, a young woman from Burkina Faso, was verbally abused and slapped during childbirth at a local hospital. Marta, a 30-year-old domestic worker from Indonesia, was refused contraceptives at a Jakarta health centre because she hasn’t had children yet. And Elena, a 10-year-old girl raped by a priest in Nicaragua, was pressured not to file a complaint and to keep quiet about the abuse, before her rapist was finally prosecuted and sentenced to 30 years in prison. These women’s names have been changed but their stories show the consequences of the entrenched discrimination faced by millions of women and girls around the world simply because of their gender. 
Being able to make our own decisions about our bodies and our lives is a basic human right, and one that we often take for granted in Canada. But for millions of women, it’s a right that is violated daily. 
On this International Women’s Day I invite you to join Amnesty International’s campaign to protect the sexual and reproductive rights of all women and girls. Join us in calling on world leaders to protect our right to make our own decisions about our bodies and our lives. 
Nearly 20 years ago at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt, 179 countries reaffirmed the human rights of women and girls to make choices about sexuality, pregnancy, and motherhood, and pledged to put women’s empowerment at the centre of policies on population and development. Despite their commitments many of the world’s 1.8 billion young people still struggle to access information, sexuality education, and sexual and reproductive health services they need. Too many young women and girls face violence, coercion, and discrimination. Many are unable to access contraception without consent from their husband or family, forced into marriage, or denied access to safe and legal abortion. Boys and girls are taught to think and behave in ways that perpetuate these violations of their human rights. Some governments and groups are even questioning the principle that women have the same rights as men. 
In 2013 and 2014, world leaders will meet to review the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action. They will discuss their progress on sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the future they hope to create. During this process, we will need to combat an increasingly well-funded and organized attack on sexual and reproductive rights and gender equality from various entities, which, if successful, would mean that justice would not be served for Elena in Nicaragua and countless other women and girls whose rights continue to be violated. 
World leaders need to hear our voices now. They need to know that we are holding them accountable to the commitments they made almost 20 years ago. They need to know that our rights will not be undermined. And they need to know that the words they agree to on paper need to be translated into concrete action that protects all women and girls. 
Take action on March 8th to help protect our rights to make decisions about our bodies and our lives!

Our self-help group began with listening to women who’d suffered conflict-related violence. At the start, women talked about their experience of forced displacement. But later, during a human rights workshop for women run by SISMA, they started asking whether anyone had been the victim of conflict-related sexual violence as well. That’s when several of us looked at each other. It’s not easy saying you’ve been raped, when you have children and when your husband doesn’t know about what happened to you. It’s terrifying. But SISMA really helped us to speak out, to describe what was actually happening. That’s how we started telling our stories, saying: “they raped me”, “I was raped too”, “and my daughters”. We began to rebuild our lives, talking about what had happened and what we’d done to come to terms with it. 
That’s when I thought I can’t keep quiet any more. No one has the right to abuse my body. It’s my body and no one has the right to touch me if I don’t want them to. I have to speak out so that all this comes to light. For me, part of getting justice is making people aware that there is sexual violence in Colombia. 
After four years of sharing our experiences in the group, I feel really proud knowing that we’re not alone. We’ve received messages from all over the world and that really makes us feel that we’re respected and our work is valued. I think it’s important that lots of people around the world know about our group. It’s as if we have their moral support and that gives us strength. Little by little, we are able to help others find a way to overcome what has happened. Personally, the most important thing for me is knowing that what we do is helping other women. 
Rape usually means the end of joy and dignity for a woman. So what we have tried to do is to be symbols of life. We want to succeed. We want to by happy. We’re fighters. We want to be true to ourselves. We know that no one has the right to judge or look down on us as victims. 
We felt very proud when Amnesty International came and we talked to them. They spoke to the government and campaigned. We saw it in the news, on the television and heard it on the radio. This was a huge step forward. We stopped being anonymous. It broke the silence. The state opened its eyes and said “we have to create a space for these women so that they can speak out and report what’s happening”. 
My message to women in other countries who’ve been raped is that it’s important not only that you report it, but that you try to overcome what has happened and get help. To women who’ve not experienced sexual violence, your solidarity is important. To men, too, I say that your support is important. If we don’t stand up, the attacks against women will continue. We won’t be silent.
