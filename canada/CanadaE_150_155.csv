Since July 2018 the Lebanese authorities have been arranging returns of refugees to Syria, claiming these returns are wholly voluntary. However, Amnesty International’s  analysis shows that people are being pushed back to Syria through a combination of restrictive government policies, dire humanitarian conditions and rampant discrimination.
“Life for many Syrian refugees in Lebanon is marked by fear, constant intimidation and feelings of hopelessness. Despite the Lebanese government’s claims that returns to Syria are voluntary, incidents like the attack on Deir al-Ahmar show that life is becoming intolerable for refugees, leaving many with no choice but to return to Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
The organization has researched how unlawful evictions, curfews, constant raids on refugee camps and mass arrests are making life unbearable for many refugees in Lebanon, forcing many to return to Syria despite the ongoing dangers.
“By failing to ensure refugees are protected from attacks, harassment or intimidation and imposing unfair and restrictive policies that make their lives more difficult, the Lebanese authorities are fuelling an environment that effectively coerces refugees to return to Syria, where they could be at risk of interrogation on arrival, torture, enforced disappearance and other violations and abuses,” said Lynn Maalouf.
For the return of refugees to Syria to be truly voluntary it must be based on their free and informed consent. Amnesty International believes that many Syrian refugees who apply to leave Lebanon are not in a position to take a free and informed decision, for a number of reasons: the dire conditions they face in Lebanon, including difficulties in obtaining or renewing valid residence visas barring them from fully accessing essential services, as well as their lack of access to objective and updated information about the current human rights situation in Syria. 
This means that the Lebanese authorities are in breach of their obligation not to return refugees to a place where they would be at real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations (the obligation of non-refoulement), as they are imposing on them conditions that effectively force them to leave Lebanon.
Deir al-Ahmar
On 5 June, Lebanese authorities ordered the evacuation of Deir al-Ahmar, which housed 600 refugees, after tensions at the camp soared when a fire broke out. Refugees living there complained that firefighters had arrived late, leading to an altercation between the refugees and local residents. NGO workers present at the camp told Amnesty International that some local men from Deir al-Ahmar threatened to burn the refugees in their tents, prompting many to flee immediately.
Later that night, at least 50 men arrived and began to attack the camp, setting three tents on fire and using a bulldozer to demolish another two. They yelled threats at the refugees: “You are sullying our soil – get the hell out of here – burn here and in hell…” None of the security forces present at the camp intervened to stop the attack. A day later, the municipal authorities of Deir al-Ahmar, as well as neighbouring villages and the nearby town of Baalbek, issued a statement ordering Syrian refugees to leave Deir al-Ahmar, describing this order as “for their own protection.”
None of the surrounding villages agreed to take in the refugees but around 90 families out of 120 were finally allowed on 10 June to set up camp in the remote village of Mekna. There, the vast majority are living in fields out in the open without access to electricity, water, food or tents, and no amenities nearby.
Desperate conditions
In another indication of just how hostile the atmosphere for refugees in Lebanon has become, the Free Patriotic Movement, a Lebanese political party, organized a meeting on 8 June to mobilize against Syrian refugees and call for their return. The party circulated leaflets bearing the following slogan: “Syria is safe to return to and Lebanon cannot cope any more” and posters urging people “to protect Lebanese workers” by reporting refugees who violate labour laws.
In April, Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council, a military body, imposed a deadline of 10 June for all “semi-permanent structures” built by Syrian refugees in informal camps in the northern town of Arsal, using cement and higher than 1.5 metres, to be demolished. According to a humanitarian worker in Arsal, the authorities are pressuring the refugees to demolish the structures themselves to avoid images of soldiers forcibly demolishing homes in the camp. A video reviewed by Amnesty International appears to show a female refugee demolishing a concrete wall using a hammer.
A document released by UNHCR on 10 June also revealed that the Lebanese authorities have tightened restrictions on Syrian refugees and children under 15 seeking regular residency status. They have also issued a new decree to deport any Syrian found to have entered Lebanon irregularly after 24 April 2019.
Around 73% of refugees from Syria live in Lebanon without valid residency visas, either because they cannot afford to pay the $200 fee or because of delays in processing applications by local authorities. Refugees without regular migration status risk detention and their access to services such as education and health care is restricted.
End “voluntary returns”
Amnesty International considers the coercive environment in which returns to Syria are taking place means that they are not voluntary. Therefore, the Lebanese authorities are in breach of their obligation under international law not to return refugees back to a place where they would be at real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations.
To date, civilians returning to their place of origin are requested to go through a “security clearance” involving interrogation by Syrian security forces responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses constituting crimes against humanity, including the use of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.
“The Lebanese government must urgently eliminate any coercive factors such as refugees’ inability to obtain official residency papers and other restrictions or stop returns of refugees to Syria altogether. For its part the international community must provide sufficient funding and resources, resettle refugees, and press the Lebanese authorities not to return refugees to Syria until it is clear that the situation there is safe and that the rights of returnees will be protected,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Background:
As of 2019 there are 938,531 Syrian refugees in Lebanon registered with UNHCR and 31,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
In addition, the Lebanese government claims that around 550,000 live in Lebanon unregistered.
In March 2019, General Security announced that 172,046 refugees had returned to Syria since December 2017 due to easing administrative restrictions and facilitating and organizing returns.

Bill C-262, a Bill to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is a vital and necessary step for reconciliation in Canada, consistent with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s recognition of the UN Declaration as “the framework” for reconciliation.
However, some Conservative Senators have already used stalling tactics to delay the Bill’s passage through the Senate and there is concern that they might use such tactics again to prevent a final vote.
These Senators have claimed to support the UN Declaration and the rights of Indigenous peoples while asserting that Bill C-262 is “rushed” and that Parliament has not had the opportunity to understand the “far-reaching” implications of implementing the UN Declaration.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Bill C-262 was adopted by the House of Commons more than a year ago following Committee hearings in which 71 witnesses were called. The Bill has now been subject to further consideration in the Senate. More to the point, the UN Declaration itself is not new or unknown.  It rests on a foundation of long-established international human rights standards that have been subject to extensive debate in Canada and internationally.
The UN Declaration was the product of more than two decades of deliberation within the UN system before its adoption in 2007. No other international human rights instrument has been subject to such long and rigorous consideration. Critically, Indigenous peoples from Canada and federal officials both played an active role in this lengthy process.
Since its adoption in 2007, the Declaration has also been reaffirmed ten times by consensus resolutions of the UN General Assembly. No State in the world currently objects to this human rights instrument.
Furthermore, all the provisions of the Declaration reflect norms and standards that were already established in international law when the Declaration was adopted. This includes provisions on self-determination contained in international treaties ratified by Canada in the 1970s.
Because of the Harper government’s initial opposition, the UN Declaration has also been the subject of extensive public debate in Canada, including within Parliament.
In 2010, the Harper government issued a formal statement endorsing the Declaration, adding that the government was “confident” that the Declaration could be interpreted “in a manner consistent with our Constitution and legal framework.” According to the statement, the basis of that confidence was having reviewed the Declaration, listened to Indigenous leaders, and learned from the experience of other countries.
In its Calls to Action, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has called on federal and other governments to fully implement the UN Declaration as “the framework” for reconciliation.
Bill C-262 is itself modest in scope. Canada has repeatedly committed to implement the UN Declaration. The Bill would create a legislative framework to guide the federal government’s role in that work of implementation. 
Critically, the Bill does NOT have the effect of codifying the Declaration into Canadian law.
Bill C-262 calls for a process by which federal laws can be reviewed in a systematic and collaborative way to ensure that Canada’s commitment to uphold the UN Declaration is being met. It would be up to Parliament to enact any required legislative changes identified in this process.
The fact is that Canadian courts regularly use international human rights standards to interpret Canadian law and work to avoid contradictions between the interpretation of Canadian law and Canada’s international commitments. The UN Declaration is already being applied by Canadian courts to interpret Canadian law in exactly this way. C-262 affirms this practice.
The Bill also calls for the government to collaborate with Indigenous peoples in developing a broader national implementation plan. Parliament would be provided an annual report on the progress being made.
Surely this is a better way forward than the piecemeal, uncoordinated and often contradictory approach taken to meeting Canada’s international human rights commitments?
The Liberal government has shifted position to fully support Bill C-262 just as the Conservative government before it changed its position to formally support the UN Declaration. By setting out a legislated requirement to move ahead with the work of implementation of the UN Declaration, Bill C-262 provides an important insulation against whatever political winds may blow under future governments. Anyone who supports implementation of the Declaration should support such a measure.
Because there is no basis for claims that C-262 has been rushed, our Nations and organizations call on all Senators to ensure the Bill is brought to a vote in a timely fashion and passed into law during this session of Parliament. If, instead, some Senators continue to employ procedural tactics to essentially kill the Bill, and oppose the human rights of Indigenous peoples, this will be a very regressive and shameful landmark in the history of the Parliament of Canada.

“Today’s court judgement sends a strong message that no one should be harassed, discriminated against or criminalized because of their sexual orientation. With this ruling, Botswana has said ‘no’ to intolerance and hate and ‘yes’ to hope and equality for all people,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“For far too long, people entering same-sex relationships in Botswana were discriminated against by the very same laws that are supposed to protect them. This court decision marks an exciting new era of acceptance, which should inspire other African countries to follow suit.”
Botswana is the latest country in Africa to decriminalize same sex relations, following Angola in January 2019, Seychelles in June 2016, Mozambique in June 2015 and São Tomé and Príncipe, and Lesotho in 2012.
However, another 29 countries in Africa retain laws criminalizing same sex relations, including Kenya, where a law banning gay sex was upheld by the Kenyan High Court in May 2019.
“It is absolutely thrilling that people in Botswana will no longer be considered criminals because of who they are and who they love. Authorities must immediately implement this progressive judgement,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
Background
On 14 March 2019, the Gaborone High Court heard an application to challenge the constitutionality of sections 164(a), 164(c) and 167 of the Botswana Penal Code which criminalised “Unnatural Offences” and “indecent practices”.
The provisions criminalised consensual sexual acts between consenting adults of the same sex and created a climate in which people could be discriminated against, harassed or subjected to violence with impunity because of their real or perceived sexual orientation.
The Lesbians, Gays & Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO), a local NGO, challenged the colonial era piece of legislation in court, with the Southern Africa Litigation Centre providing legal support.

UN and AU set to vote to close UNAMID peacekeeping mission on 27 June
Peacekeeper drawdown would expose civilians to brutal tactics of Sudanese security forces
UN and AU must pause the drawdown of UNAMID and resist Transitional Military Council demand to hand over bases to Rapid Support Forces 
Amnesty International has disturbing new evidence, including satellite imagery, showing that Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur. In the past year these have included the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings, and sexual violence.
Tens of thousands of civilians currently protected by United Nations (UN)/African Union (AU) peacekeepers (UNAMID) in Jebel Marra, Darfur, must not be placed at the mercy of the RSF, a ruthless Sudanese security force that has committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, the organization warned ahead of a crucial vote on the mission’s future on 27 June.
If the UN Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Council authorize UNAMID’s closure, it would effectively give the RSF control over civilian areas. Formed from the former “Janjaweed” militia, the RSF are responsible for crimes against humanity in Darfur’s Jebel Marra region as well as the ongoing bloody crackdown on protesters in Khartoum since 3 June.
“In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we’ve witnessed the Rapid Support Forces’ despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years. Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC) must immediately withdraw the RSF from any policing and law enforcement operations, especially in Khartoum and Darfur, and confine them to their barracks in the interests of public safety,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“As for the UN and the AU, they must not turn their backs on people in Darfur who rely on peacekeepers for protection. A decision to close UNAMID would recklessly and needlessly place tens of thousands of lives at risk by removing their only safeguard against the government’s scorched earth campaign.”
UNAMID drawdown
In 2017 and 2018, the UN and AU decided to dramatically reduce the number of UNAMID troops, close the majority of its bases, and reconfigure the remainder of the mission to focus on the protection of civilians in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur, where the human rights and protection concerns were greatest. At the end of June, the AU and UN are considering voting to withdraw all the remaining peacekeepers from Darfur by June 2020, including the majority of the remaining team sites by December 2019.
The closed UNAMID bases were supposed to be handed over to the government to use for civilian purposes but are, in fact, nearly all being used by the RSF. This same Sudanese government security force carried out crimes against humanity in North and South Darfur in 2014, in Jebel Marra in 2015 and 2016, continues to carry out war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Jebel Marra, and was chiefly responsible for killing scores of protesters in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum since 3 June 2019. Moreover, Sudan’s current governing body – the TMC – has demanded that the remaining UNAMID bases be handed over directly to the RSF.
“Given the RSF’s history of brutality in Jebel Marra, North Darfur, South Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile, and the shocking violence the very same forces have been meting out against protesters in Khartoum in recent days, it is bewildering that the UN and AU would even consider removing the last peacekeepers from Darfur, effectively handing over control of civilian areas in Jebel Marra to them at this time,” said Jonathan Loeb, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International.
“The logic behind the drawdown was premised on the idea that peacekeepers should withdraw once conditions on the ground had sufficiently improved. This arguably made sense in certain parts of Darfur, but it is not the case in Jebel Marra. Perversely, the UN is using its own failure to document the violence in Jebel Marra as the basis for its argument that the mission should close.”
Evidence of ongoing ‘scorched earth’ attacks
Hundreds of thousands have died from direct violence and conflict-related disease and starvation during the conflict in Darfur. According to the UN, approximately 2 million people remain displaced by violence in Darfur, many of whom remain refugees in neighboring Chad.
Despite severe government restrictions on access to Jebel Marra for journalists, independent human rights monitors, and UNAMID, Amnesty International has been able to confirm recent attacks against the region’s civilians, much of which have gone unreported by the mission.
Satellite evidence and testimonies confirm that government forces and associated militias damaged or destroyed at least 45 villages in Jebel Marra between July 2018 and February 2019. Amnesty International has also documented other abuses by security forces, including unlawful killings, sexual violence, systematic looting, and forced displacement.
Jebel Marra civilians taking refuge at UNAMID base
Closing the mission could have a devastating impact on the displaced population in and around Jebel Marra, many of whom rely on UNAMID bases for protection.
UNAMID’s Sortoni base in northern Jebel Marra is one example of where UNAMID’s presence is still vital. In 2016, tens of thousands of civilians fled to the area immediately around the base after the Sudanese government forces destroyed their villages; many remain there today, unable to go home because of fear of ongoing attacks by security forces against people who attempt to return to their areas to farm. Closing the base will leave people exposed to attack by the very same fighters who destroyed their villages and still continued to carry out attacks in the area during the past year.
Amnesty International interviewed people living around Sortoni and other UNAMID bases in Jebel Marra, nearly all of whom said they feared a return to large-scale violence if UNAMID left, and that they would be forced to flee again if this happens.
Adam, a 54-year-old man who was displaced to Sortoni by violence in 2016 told Amnesty International that his brother was killed in late 2018 when he tried to return to his farm in northern Jebel Marra. Adam told Amnesty International that he is fearful of UNAMID leaving: “UNAMID, even though they are not doing much… their existence is a threat to the [security forces] who want to mistreat people… that is why [those forces] don’t commit atrocities. If UNAMID is not there then they will have nothing to fear. … If no one is protecting them there will be unimaginable behavior. Anyone who is armed can do anything.”
“Although UNAMID has consistently failed to prevent attacks on villages, it has been able to provide protection for civilians displaced by violence who manage to get themselves to safety near UNAMID bases. In certain parts of Darfur this protection is still urgently needed and UNAMID’s mere presence in these areas justifies the mission’s continued existence in Jebel Marra,” said Jonathan Loeb.
RSF crackdown in Khartoum
The case against closing UNAMID has been made even stronger by events in Khartoum on 3 June, when the RSF swept into protest sites and opened fire on unarmed people, killing more than 100 and injuring many more. Senior commanders in charge of the TMC – which includes the RSF – are the same individuals responsible for carrying out atrocities in Darfur.
“It’s hard to imagine a worse time to decide to close UNAMID. Sudan is in the middle of a political crisis. And given that the men who have retained political and military power are the architects of many of the most violent campaigns during the Darfur conflict, it would be dangerously naive for the UN Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Council to dismiss the possibility of an escalation of violence against civilians in Darfur. A decision to remove the last remaining peacekeepers from Darfur at this time would reveal a shocking lack of understanding about the current reality in Sudan,” said Jonathan Loeb.

Parole comes days after detention of journalist, Ivan Golunov  
Responding to news that Shali City Court in Chechnya has granted parole to the imprisoned human rights defender Oyub Titiev after almost one-and-a-half years behind bars, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia said:
“We have been calling for Oyub Titiev’s immediate and unconditional release since his detention. The real agenda behind his criminal prosecution on trumped up charges was to stop a human rights defender from doing his lawful human rights work.
“In spite of overwhelming evidence that the case against him had been fabricated, the authorities in Chechnya crudely abused the justice system to convict an innocent man. Today the court decided to at least partially amend the gross injustice by releasing Oyub in ten days time.
“But if justice is to prevail, Oyub Titiev’s conviction should be quashed, and he must be given access to an effective remedy, including compensation, for his unlawful imprisonment. We further call on the Russian authorities to ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia.
“This decision comes just days after prominent Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was detained and charged with supplying drugs amid allegations that he was framed, held incommunicado and beaten in custody. He is currently under house arrest and we call on his allegations against the authorities to be immediately investigated.”
Background
Oyub Titiev, the head of the Chechen office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre, was stopped in his car by police on 9 January 2018 and held incommunicado for several hours. The Chechen authorities later stated that drugs had been “discovered” in his car. Titiev denied the allegations and insisted the drugs had been planted by police.
He was sentenced to four years in a penal colony for “drugs possession” (Article 228, part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) by the Shali City Court in Chechnya on 18 March 2019. Prior to the sentencing, he spent one year and two months in pre-trial detention.
Amnesty International believes Oyub Titiev was a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for his work for the victims of human rights abuses in the Chechen Republic.

0,52 Years of Human Rights Abuse,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/business-and-human-rights/52-years-of-human-rights-abuse/,"June 2019 marks the 52nd anniversary of Israel’s capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip during a war with its neighbours, and the beginning of its occupation of Palestinian territory.

Today, over 600,000 Jewish-Israeli settlers are living on occupied Palestinian land and are afforded protections and benefits, of which over 4.9 million Palestinians living in the same territory do not have access to. This is the direct result of a discriminatory system of laws and policies that ensure that Palestinians are not afforded the same rights or services as Israeli settlers. 
For 52 years, hundreds of thousands of hectares of Palestinian land have been appropriated and exploited by Israel. For 52 years, tens of thousands of Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), resulting in the displacement of thousands of Palestinians. The wanton destruction of property and the forcible transfer of civilians in the occupied territory are both war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
 
When a power assumes the occupation of a territory, it also assumes responsibility for the protection, security, and welfare of the local population in the occupied territory under international law.  
Israel must respect and guarantee protections for the local Palestinian population under international humanitarian and human rights law. Generations of Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories have fallen victim to a discriminatory system built to repress their rights and freedoms. 
For 52 years, it has been an Israeli government policy to promote the creation and expansion of Israeli settlements in the OPT. These settlements are directly linked to the mass human rights violations faced by Palestinians in the occupied territory. These violations include: 
Violation of the right to equality and non-discrimination; 
Violation of the right to adequate housing; 
Violation of the right to liberty of movement;  
Violation of the right to access to an effective remedy for acts violating fundamental rights;  
Violation of the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
Violation of the right to water;  
Violation of the right to education; 
Violation of the right to earn a decent living through work; 
Violation of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly;  
Violations of the right to liberty, security of the person and equal treatment before the law; 
Violations of the right of the child; 
Violations of the right to family life; 
Violations of the right to life 
As the Israeli government continues to pursues policies promoting the expansion of illegal settlements, it enforced a discriminatory system against Palestinians residing in the same territory, by enacting military laws to increase barriers to Palestinians in obtaining building permits, demolishing Palestinian structures for building without permits, and charging punitive costs for the demolition of homes. This has resulted in the forcible transfer and displacement of communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories from their lands. 
For 52 years, Israel has acted in breach of international humanitarian law through the appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property. The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits “the destruction of private or state property, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.”  
Article 49 of the Convention also states that an occupying power is prohibited from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. Yet, programs and financial incentives have been geared towards supporting Israeli settlers and growing illegal settlements.  
Settlements and settlers linked to the tourism industry are experiencing an increase in support, as the Israeli government announced it would spend $13 million USD on excavations at the settler-managed archaeological site, the City of David. This site is located in the predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan. The Prime Minister’s office also announced subsidies for the “establishment, conservation, and expansion” of hotels, B&Bs, and guest rooms in the settlements in the West Bank. 
As Israel continues to build these programs, the country is experiencing an increase in visitors, with more than 4 million tourists recorded in 2018. This has resulted in great financial profits to both Israel and the businesses operating within the Occupied Palestinian Territories. These businesses include digital tourism companies, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor. 
The US-based TripAdvisor, which recorded an average of nearly 455 million visitors per month in 2017, lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels, and rental apartments within settlements of the OPT and East Jerusalem, often mislabelling them as being part of Israel. TripAdvisor also lists tourist attractions, many of which are drivers behind some of the human rights violations of Palestinian communities in Qaryut, Jalud, and Khirbet Susiya. The listing of these sites make TripAdvisor complicit in Israel’s human rights violations of the residents of these neighborhoods. 
SIGN THE PETITION TO TRIPADVISOR NOW  
  
The responsibility to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law is not only the responsibility of the state – it is also the responsibility of businesses operating within the state. Companies operating in or with settlements must consider the standards relating to the protection of populations of occupied territories. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor are contributing to and profiting from the maintenance, development, and expansion of illegal settlements.  
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights states that companies have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights wherever they operate. Companies must avoid causing or contributing to the violations of human rights in their operations. In cases where these violations cannot be prevented, companies must refrain from operating as the only course of action. Companies that fail to withdraw from these situations may stand in direct contradiction with their own corporate standards.  
It’s time for Canada to stop supporting Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land. We want the Canadian government and Canadian businesses to stop enabling the economy that keeps these illegal settlements growing and fuels the human rights violations of Palestinians.  
The forcible displacement, the confiscation of land and natural resources, the demolition of homes, property and infrastructure, and restrictions on movement continues to have a direct and devastating impact on Palestinian rights to adequate standards of living, work, housing, health and education.  
Amnesty’s Destination: Occupation campaign calls on digital tourism companies to stop providing listings in illegal settlements. We call on governments around the world to take regulatory action to prevent companies such as these from doing business in or with Israel’s illegal settlements in line with their legal commitments.

0,52 Years of Human Rights Abuse,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/business-and-human-rights/blog-52-years-human-rights-abuse/,"June 2019 marks the 52nd anniversary of Israel’s capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip during a war with its neighbours, and the beginning of its occupation of Palestinian territory.

Today, over 600,000 Jewish-Israeli settlers are living on occupied Palestinian land and are afforded protections and benefits, of which over 4.9 million Palestinians living in the same territory do not have access to. This is the direct result of a discriminatory system of laws and policies that ensure that Palestinians are not afforded the same rights or services as Israeli settlers. 
For 52 years, hundreds of thousands of hectares of Palestinian land have been appropriated and exploited by Israel. For 52 years, tens of thousands of Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), resulting in the displacement of thousands of Palestinians. The wanton destruction of property and the forcible transfer of civilians in the occupied territory are both war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
 
When a power assumes the occupation of a territory, it also assumes responsibility for the protection, security, and welfare of the local population in the occupied territory under international law.  
Israel must respect and guarantee protections for the local Palestinian population under international humanitarian and human rights law. Generations of Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories have fallen victim to a discriminatory system built to repress their rights and freedoms. 
For 52 years, it has been an Israeli government policy to promote the creation and expansion of Israeli settlements in the OPT. These settlements are directly linked to the mass human rights violations faced by Palestinians in the occupied territory. These violations include: 
Violation of the right to equality and non-discrimination; 
Violation of the right to adequate housing; 
Violation of the right to liberty of movement;  
Violation of the right to access to an effective remedy for acts violating fundamental rights;  
Violation of the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
Violation of the right to water;  
Violation of the right to education; 
Violation of the right to earn a decent living through work; 
Violation of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly;  
Violations of the right to liberty, security of the person and equal treatment before the law; 
Violations of the right of the child; 
Violations of the right to family life; 
Violations of the right to life 
As the Israeli government continues to pursues policies promoting the expansion of illegal settlements, it enforced a discriminatory system against Palestinians residing in the same territory, by enacting military laws to increase barriers to Palestinians in obtaining building permits, demolishing Palestinian structures for building without permits, and charging punitive costs for the demolition of homes. This has resulted in the forcible transfer and displacement of communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories from their lands. 
For 52 years, Israel has acted in breach of international humanitarian law through the appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property. The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits “the destruction of private or state property, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.”  
Article 49 of the Convention also states that an occupying power is prohibited from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. Yet, programs and financial incentives have been geared towards supporting Israeli settlers and growing illegal settlements.  
Settlements and settlers linked to the tourism industry are experiencing an increase in support, as the Israeli government announced it would spend $13 million USD on excavations at the settler-managed archaeological site, the City of David. This site is located in the predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan. The Prime Minister’s office also announced subsidies for the “establishment, conservation, and expansion” of hotels, B&Bs, and guest rooms in the settlements in the West Bank. 
As Israel continues to build these programs, the country is experiencing an increase in visitors, with more than 4 million tourists recorded in 2018. This has resulted in great financial profits to both Israel and the businesses operating within the Occupied Palestinian Territories. These businesses include digital tourism companies, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor. 
The US-based TripAdvisor, which recorded an average of nearly 455 million visitors per month in 2017, lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels, and rental apartments within settlements of the OPT and East Jerusalem, often mislabelling them as being part of Israel. TripAdvisor also lists tourist attractions, many of which are drivers behind some of the human rights violations of Palestinian communities in Qaryut, Jalud, and Khirbet Susiya. The listing of these sites make TripAdvisor complicit in Israel’s human rights violations of the residents of these neighborhoods. 
SIGN THE PETITION TO TRIPADVISOR NOW  
  
The responsibility to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law is not only the responsibility of the state – it is also the responsibility of businesses operating within the state. Companies operating in or with settlements must consider the standards relating to the protection of populations of occupied territories. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor are contributing to and profiting from the maintenance, development, and expansion of illegal settlements.  
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights states that companies have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights wherever they operate. Companies must avoid causing or contributing to the violations of human rights in their operations. In cases where these violations cannot be prevented, companies must refrain from operating as the only course of action. Companies that fail to withdraw from these situations may stand in direct contradiction with their own corporate standards.  
It’s time for Canada to stop supporting Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land. We want the Canadian government and Canadian businesses to stop enabling the economy that keeps these illegal settlements growing and fuels the human rights violations of Palestinians.  
The forcible displacement, the confiscation of land and natural resources, the demolition of homes, property and infrastructure, and restrictions on movement continues to have a direct and devastating impact on Palestinian rights to adequate standards of living, work, housing, health and education.  
Amnesty’s Destination: Occupation campaign calls on digital tourism companies to stop providing listings in illegal settlements. We call on governments around the world to take regulatory action to prevent companies such as these from doing business in or with Israel’s illegal settlements in line with their legal commitments.   
Amnesty’s Occupation @50 campaign brings to light the more than half-century of these human rights abuses in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Join us in putting an end to these violations by demanding that the Canadian government ban settlement products from entering our markets, and stop companies domiciled in Canada from operating in illegal settlements.

Dear Friends at Amnesty International, 
Words cannot express how overwhelmed and thankful I am for the Urgent Action you initiated regarding the threats against me and the attacks against human rights defenders in the Philippines! Indeed, during the past months, several dreadful events occurred, including the killings of peasant leaders in the Negros province and the assassination of our dear colleague, city councillor Bernardino ‘Toto’ Patigas. Toto is the 58th Karapatan human rights worker who has been killed since we created the alliance. 
I and my fellow human rights workers of Karapatan have received an almost daily barrage of death threats, vilification and smear campaigns as we all navigate this increasing constriction of civil society space and the nagging sense of danger under the current administration. On May 6, 2019, we filed a petition for the writs of amparo and habeas data to seek legal protection from the Supreme Court and for the disclosure and destruction of all government files or records that may endanger us. Your voices made me/us feel that we are not alone, and that solidarity indeed knows no boundaries.  
As we brace for the results of the midterm Philippine elections on May 13, we take heart and strength from the support of the communities we serve, and the support of friends like you in the international community. It is our solemn pledge that we shall continue to defend and uphold human rights and people’s rights in the Philippines, despite the perils.

The organization has confirmed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution sought the death penalty for Murtaja Qureiris...","Saudi Arabia must not use the death penalty to punish a young man who was arrested at the age of 13 for participating in anti-government protests, said Amnesty International today.
The organization has confirmed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution sought the death penalty for Murtaja Qureiris in August 2018 for a series of offences, some of which date back to when he was just 10 years old. CNN this week revealed he was facing the death penalty and published video footage showing him participating in bike protests in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province as a young boy in 2011.
“There should be no doubt that the Saudi Arabian authorities are ready to go to any length to crack down on dissent against their own citizens, including by resorting to the death penalty for men who were merely boys at the time of their arrest,” said Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf.
“It is appalling that Murtaja Qureiris is facing execution for offences that include taking part in protests while he was just 10 years old.”
The use of the death penalty for offences committed by people below 18 years of age is strictly prohibited by international law.
Mainly populated by Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority, the Eastern Province saw waves of protests in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab uprisings which the authorities have cracked down over the years, including through prosecutions.
Murtaja Qureiris, now aged 18, was arrested in September 2014 and detained at Dar al-Mulahaza at the juvenile detention centre in al-Dammam city. He was held in solitary confinement for a month and subjected to beatings and intimidation during his interrogation. His interrogators promised to release him if he confessed to the charges against him. In May 2017 he was moved to al-Mabaheth prison in al-Dammam, an adult prison, even though he was just 16 years old. Throughout his detention he was denied access to a lawyer until after his first court session in August 2018 at the Specialized Criminal Court, an anti-terror court set up in 2008, that has increasingly been used for cases involving human rights activists and protesters. 
The charges against him include participating in anti-government protests, attending the funeral of his brother Ali Qureiris who was killed in a protest in 2011, joining a “terrorist organization,” throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station, and firing at security forces. He is currently awaiting his next trial session.
“The Saudi Arabian authorities have a chilling track record of using the death penalty as a weapon to crush political dissent and punish anti-government protesters -including children- from the country’s persecuted Shi’a minority,” said Lynn Maalouf.
In April, Amnesty International confirmed the execution of Abdulkareem al-Hawaj, another Shi’a young man arrested aged 16 and convicted of offences related to his involvement in anti-government protests. He was among 37 men put to death in one day as part of a gruesome execution spree earlier this year.
Three other Shi’a men Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon, who were arrested individually in 2012 aged 17, 16 and 17 respectively, in connection with their involvement in anti-government protests, are at risk of being executed at any time.
“Instead of stepping up their use of the death penalty to silence critics Saudi Arabia’s authorities should immediately revoke the death sentences against Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon and save these young men’s lives. The international community also has a crucial role – they must take a public stand on these cases and demand that the Saudi authorities end their use of the death penalty once and for all,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Saudi Arabia has an appalling record of using the death penalty – including against children – after grossly unfair trials that rely on confessions extracted through torture. Use of the death penalty is appalling in all circumstances but it is even more so when it is applied after an unfair trial. Amnesty International opposes the use of the death penalty in all circumstances without exception.

Background
Since 2014 more than 100 Shi’a Saudi Arabians have been tried before the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) on vague and wide-ranging charges arising from their opposition to the government, including peaceful criticism of the authorities.
Amnesty International has documented that a number of cases of Shi’a activists tried before the SCC have faced grossly unfair trials with defendants convicted and, in many cases, sentenced to death on vague charges that criminalise peaceful opposition and on the basis of “confessions” extracted through torture or other coercive means.

Police in Addis Ababa this morning prevented journalist and former Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience, Eskinder Nega, from holding a press conference to announce plans for his new TV station, Senai. Police officers blocked the entrance to the Hilton hotel turning journalists and other attendees away. 
This follows a similar move on 3 June when the police barred a previous press conference organized by Eskinder to announce his plans for his TV channel at the Ethiopia Hotel, also in Addis Ababa.
“This harassment is solely aimed at frustrating the outspoken Eskinder Nega and curtailing his right to freedom of expression. It is unacceptable and must be stopped because Ethiopia’s laws do not require press conferences to be approved or licensed. The police have no right to stop press conferences,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
In March this year, Eskinder tried to hold another press conference on the administration of Addis Ababa but it was cancelled by the police for “security reasons”.
Eskinder also uses Twitter to voice his opinions on a variety of issues, where he has also faced hostility, including threats to his life.
“This week’s interference with Eskinder’s press conferences show that the police and other authorities are not fulfilling their role in upholding freedom of expression in Ethiopia,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
“While Eskinder’s statements may be offensive to some, they fall under the right to freedom of expression permitted under international law and must therefore be respected.”
The Ethiopian authorities must consider training the police on human rights and their role in upholding and protecting everyone’s rights, as well as designing a national awareness campaign to sensitize the public on human rights as the country emerges from decades of repression.
Background
Eskinder Nega, a journalist and blogger, was released from prison in February 2018 after serving seven years of an 18-year prison sentence. Since his release, he has been publishing the weekly Ethiopis newspaper. He has been leading discussions on issues such as democracy, ethnic nationalism, and the administration of Addis Ababa.

“The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International’s highest honour, celebrating people who have shown unique leadership and courage in standing up for human rights. I can think of no better recipients this year than Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future climate strike movement,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“We are humbled and inspired by the determination with which youth activists across the world are challenging us all to confront the realities of the climate crisis. Every young person taking part in Fridays for Future embodies what it means to act on your conscience. They remind us that we are more powerful than we know and that we all have a role to play in protecting human rights against climate catastrophe.”
The Ambassador of Conscience Award was founded in 2002 to celebrate individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by acting on their conscience, confronting injustice and using their talents to inspire others.  Previous awardees include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, Harry Belafonte, Ai Weiwei, the Youth Groups of West and Central Africa, Angélique Kidjo, the Indigenous rights movement in Canada, Alicia Keys and Colin Kaepernick.
A youth movement determined to change the world
The Fridays for Future movement was started by Greta Thunberg, a teenager from Sweden who in August 2018 decided to miss school every Friday and instead protest outside the Swedish parliament until it took more serious action to tackle climate change.
Her efforts to raise awareness of the climate crisis quickly went global. More than 1 million young people from all over the world took part in the most recent global day of Fridays for Future school strikes on 24 May. Demonstrations were held in more than 100 countries, including Australia, Brazil, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, the Philippines and Uganda.
“It is a huge honour to receive Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award on behalf of Fridays for Future. This is not my award, this is everyone’s award. It is amazing to see the recognition we are getting and know that we are fighting for something that is having an impact,” said Greta Thunberg.
“To act on your conscience means that you fight for what you think is right. I think all those who are part of this movement are doing that, because we have a duty to try and improve the world. The blatant injustice we all need to fight against is that people in the global south are the ones who are and will be most affected by climate change while they are the least responsible for causing it.”
A human rights crisis
While the climate crisis is usually understood through the impacts it is having on our natural environment, the devastating consequences of these impacts on people, both now and in the future, make it an urgent human rights issue as well. Climate change compounds and magnifies existing inequalities. And its effects will continue to grow and worsen over time, creating ruin for current and future generations.
Amnesty International has said that the failure of governments to act on climate change may well be the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.
“Human rights and the climate crisis go hand in hand. We can’t solve one without solving the other. Climate change means people won’t be able to grow food, their homes will come under threat and their health will be compromised. Governments have a duty to protect us, so why are they doing nothing to stop climate change from devastating our lives?” said Greta Thunberg.
Amnesty International calls on states to scale up climate action substantially and to do so in a manner consistent with human rights. One of the crucial ways this can happen is if the people most affected by climate change, such as children and young people, are able to engage in efforts to address and mitigate climate change. They should be provided with the necessary information and education to participate meaningfully in discussions and should be included in decision-making that directly affects them.
“Sometimes I feel really sad because some of the people I try to talk to won’t listen. Some people insult us, others think we are politicians, and others ignore us entirely, they tell us maybe we won’t finish what we’ve started.  But I can assure everyone that we are really determined to finish what we have started, because our futures are on the line,” said Kananura Irene, a Fridays for Future activist from Kampala, Uganda.
The youth activists behind Fridays for Future are now calling on adults to join them. On Friday 20 September, ahead of the United Nation Climate Action Summit in New York, activists will commence a week of climate action with a worldwide strike for the climate. Amnesty International supports the call for all adults who are able to join the strike and show solidarity.
“Young people are often told they are the leaders of tomorrow. I am so glad that Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future activists ignored that message. If they wait until tomorrow, there will be no future for any of us. They have proved that they are already leaders, and now it’s time for adults to follow their lead,” said Kumi Naidoo.

Panos...","Marking the second anniversary of the start of the US-led Coalition’s military offensive in Raqqa, Syria, Amnesty International today launched “The Ruins of Liberation,” a multimedia storytelling site giving a behind-the-scenes look at its investigations in the bombed-out city.
Panos photographer Andrea DiCenzo accompanied Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Advisor Donatella Rovera on a visit to Raqqa in February 2019, documenting her investigation. Images by DiCenzo and Rovera are combined with audio commentary with Rovera giving an intimate description of the people she met and the reality she exposed. 
Rovera and her fellow researchers – including a team of specialists in remote sensing and open-source investigation – investigated the Raqqa military campaign for over 18 months. They visited more than 200 strike sites, interviewed more than 400 survivors and witnesses, and released several reports, culminating in an unprecedented investigation in partnership with Airwars that documented the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians as a result of Coalition attacks – which dwarves the 180 deaths it has admitted.
“On the ground in Raqqa I witnessed a level of destruction not comparable to anything I’ve seen in decades of covering the impact of war,” said Donatella Rovera.
“This site brings home the reality of the suffering I encountered and explains why I kept returning: to seek justice for civilians trying to piece together their lives. Two years on, the US-led Coalition must investigate the full scale of civilian casualties it caused, and ensure victims and their families receive full reparation and compensation.”
Background
The US-led Coalition’s campaign to oust so-called “Islamic State” from Raqqa was among the most destructive in modern warfare. The offensive, lasting from 6 June to 17 October 2017 and led by US, UK and French forces, killed and injured thousands of residents and reduced homes, businesses and infrastructure to rubble.
Civilians trapped by the fighting were prevented from fleeing by IS snipers and mines. Many were killed in their homes by the Coalition’s air bombardments and indiscriminate artillery strikes.
Then Coalition commander Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend claimed the offensive had been “the most precise air campaign in history”, but field investigations conducted by Amnesty International reveal this is a far cry from reality.

Tuncak made his preliminary observations – which will be followed by a report about the government’s steps to protect human rights implicated by the management of hazardous wastes – following an eight-stop trip across Canada that included a visit with those who have been impacted by mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows First Nation.  
In response, Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada’s Indigenous Rights Campaigner, said:
“We welcome these comments by an independent United Nations expert and hope that they will shine a light on the urgent need for swift and full compensation to those who have been dealing with mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows. For five decades, the federal and provincial governments have all but ignored the mercury crisis that has contaminated the First Nation’s traditional food, devastated its local economy and caused serious physical and mental health impacts. We urge Canada to properly remediate the English and Wabigoon Rivers, establish a trust fund to build and operate a health treatment facility and adequately compensate the people of Grassy Narrows.”
Further, the Special Rapporteur’s concerns about mercury contamination in Grassy Narrows are consistent with a broader pattern of discrimination noted in his preliminary observations. As he concluded in his statement published online today: “There exists a pattern in Canada where marginalized groups, Indigenous peoples in particular, find themselves on the wrong side of a toxic divide, subject to conditions that would not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada.”

Netsanet Belay, Africa Director at Amnesty International, said:
“This should be a week of celebration in Khartoum, as residents mark the first Eid-al-Fitr since the end of Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year reign of terror. |nstead, as security forces roam the streets killing and attacking people, the holiday has become a time of fear, shock and grief.
“Doctors in Khartoum have reported that as many as 100 people have been killed since Monday, when forces including RSF members swept into protest sites and opened fire on unarmed people. The death toll is now soaring as the RSF, the special military force which killed, raped and tortured thousands in Darfur, brings its murderous rampage to the capital. Reports that bodies have been dumped in the river demonstrate the utter depravity of these so-called security forces.
“Sudan’s recent history has been defined by impunity for war crimes and other serious human rights violations. We are urging the African Union Peace and Security Council and the UN Security Council to break this cycle of impunity and take immediate action to hold the perpetrators of this violence accountable.” 
Background
The RSF was created in 2013 under the command of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). Amnesty International and many other human rights groups have documented serious crimes committed by RSF in the past, including in the context of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur.

“The sham charges levelled against Nguyen Ngoc Anh show that no one is safe on Facebook in Vietnam anymore. Anh is only the last case in a growing list of netizens prosecuted, arrested or detained solely for peacefully discussing public affairs or criticizing the government.
“The authorities in Hanoi are now extending, online, the chokehold they have put on civic and political rights in the country for decades, using Facebook as a tool to further their repression of dissenting voices.
“The court should drop these politically-motivated charges and release him immediately and unconditionally.”
Background
Nguyen Ngoc Anh is an aquatic engineer from Ben Tre province. He is active in political debates on social media and especially used Facebook to express his opinions and share content from other Facebook users.
In June 2018, the Vietnamese National Assembly tabled a draft law to establish new special economic zones (SEZs), raising the prospect of significant amounts of land coming under foreign ownership for up to 99 years. The law sparked a nation-wide outcry and led to mass demonstrations across the country. The authorities responded by cracking down on peaceful protestors in Ho Chi Minh City and other provinces in southern Vietnam.
Nguyen Ngoc Anh was arrested on 30 August 2018 on charges of ‘making, storing, disseminating or propagandizing materials and products that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam’, an offense under article 117 of the 2015 Penal Code. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

The National Inquiry’s final report states, “Colonial violence, as well as racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people, has become embedded in everyday life – whether this is through interpersonal forms of violence, through institutions like the health care system and the justice system, or in the laws, policies and structures of Canadian society. The result has been that many Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue.”
The report further states, “Nothing will improve the current situation unless there is will to address the root cause of this ongoing crisis, the profound multi-institutional indifference toward violence directed at Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people.”
Amnesty International welcomes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s comments, which commit the government of Canada to “develop and implement a National Action Plan to address violence against Indigenous women, girls, and LGBTQ and two-spirit people.”
Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English) said, “Governments in Canada, indeed Canadian society as a whole, have ignored and downplayed the shocking levels of violence faced by Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons. We hope the Inquiry report will be the catalyst for all governments to finally commit to the kind of comprehensive, systematic, and coordinated national response necessitated by what is truly a human rights emergency. As a crucial step in that direction, as we look ahead to the federal election in October, we call on all federal political parties to similarly commit to a National Action Plan in keeping with Call for Justice 1.1.”
The report’s “Calls for Justice” require both broad and specific changes to numerous institutions, programs, and policies, as well as increased funding across all jurisdictions in Canada, to truly address the root causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people. Amnesty International welcomes the recommendation for “long-term sustainable funding of Indigenous-led, low-barrier shelters, safe spaces, transition homes, second-stage housing and services for Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people” such that all Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons have access to culturally-appropriate services wherever they reside.
The Calls for Justice in the National Inquiry’s final report also include: 
Indigenous governments and institutions, and federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, to develop and implement a national action plan to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons; 
The design and delivery of social services to Indigenous peoples to be carried out on a basis of respect for human rights, with no barriers to accessibility based on where people live; 
Long-term, sustained, and equitable funding to address the large gaps in government services that deny substantive equality to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit persons, including those who have experienced violence; 
Elimination of all sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act; 
The creation of task force empowered to review and potentially re-open police investigations where there are concerns that cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons have not been properly handled; 
Consistent collection and public release of disaggregated data concerning levels of violence against Métis, First Nations, and Inuit women, girls, and two-spirit persons, including numbers of missing persons and homicides; 
Measures to address the rapid turnover of police personnel assigned to northern and remote communities; and 
Consideration of gender impacts and identification of mitigation strategies at all stages in the planning, assessment, implementation, and monitoring of resource development projects. 
One month ago, Amnesty International, Indigenous peoples’ organizations, women’s rights, and other equality-seeking organizations submitted a joint open letter to Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett setting out the critical importance of a clear federal commitment to action before the current session of Parliament ends later this month.
The National Inquiry is the second commission of inquiry to find that Canada is responsible for genocide against Indigenous peoples. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission established that colonial laws and policies had the expressed intent of destroying Indigenous societies in Canada. The National Inquiry links violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons to the legacy of these genocidal laws and policies and the continuation of the same social attitudes.
“Like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission before it, the National Inquiry has invited all concerned individuals to help end this grave human rights crisis by confronting sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and colonialism and demanding more and better of our governments and public institutions,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, directrice générale of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “Amnesty International acknowledges the decades of grassroots activism led by Indigenous women that have brought us to where we are now. We commit to continued solidarity with these activists to ensure that Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons in Canada can live in safety and dignity, free from violence and discrimination.”
As a Party with Standing to the National Inquiry, Amnesty International had advance access to the National Inquiry’s final report. We will be in a position to comment further in the coming days as we have a chance to fully review the report’s findings and recommendations.

The organization also called for an immediate end to the violent attacks by the Rapid Support Forces and other security forces against protestors and for those responsible for the brutal attacks, which left at least 13 people dead, to be held accountable.
At around 4:30 am on 3 June, armed forces under the command of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) attacked peaceful protestors in Khartoum State, firing live bullets and tear gas, setting tents on fire and beating protestors.
“Many of those attacked this morning were sleeping when the Rapid Support Forces and other Sudanese security agencies began unleashing deadly violence. With this senseless slaughter the TMC has completely destroyed the trust of the Sudanese people and crushed the people’s hope for a new era of respect for human rights and respect for the right to protest without fear,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The United Nations Security Council should immediately put pressure on the interim military authorities to end these attacks against peaceful protestors, and must consider targeted sanctions on members of the TMC and others involved in the attack.
“The Sudanese people suffered for decades under the repressive rule of Omar al-Bashir, and his ousting should have represented a new chapter of respect for human rights. Today’s bloodshed shows that the transitional authorities have utterly failed to turn the page on Sudan’s appalling human rights record, and the international community must take immediate action to show this will not be tolerated.”
Amnesty International is also calling on the African Union Peace and Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to address the situation in the country and ensure respect for human rights and the right to peaceful protest.
The number of people reported dead currently stands at 13 and is growing as more succumb to injuries. More than 100 people are being treated for various injuries, according to the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD). Amnesty International received reports that security forces attacked at least two hospitals close to the sit-in area in Khartoum – Almoalim and Royal Care hospitals – in pursuit of the injured. 
Background
At around 3am local time, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), who led the organization of the protests since December 2018, issued warnings of an imminent attack by security forces aimed at breaking the sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, where protestors have been camped since 9 April.
At about 4:30 am, around 100 security vehicles without number plates and laden with heavy weapons and hundreds of soldiers, parked in front of the sit-in area. Within 30 minutes, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and other security forces attacked sleeping protestors, firing live bullets and tear gas, setting tents on fire and brutally beating protestors.
On 30 May, the TMC issued a statement claiming the protestor sit-in had been infiltrated by “uncontrollable elements” and had therefore become a hotspot for crime and a threat to the protesters. On the same day, the TMC wrote to diplomatic missions asking them to stay away from the protest site.
In an interview with Sky News on 3 June, TMC spokesman Lieutenant-General Shams al-Din Kabashi confirmed that the security forces attacked “some saboteurs” in the nearby Colombia area along Nile Street but denied attacking the sit-in area.
Protestors in Port Sudan, Gadarif and Sinja were also attacked by security officers, according to Nazim Seraj, a leading member of a civilian committee responsible for the treatment of injured. Security forces have also been beating protesters, stealing their phones and money and then releasing them.

“This shockingly harsh sentence is an outrageous injustice. Amirsalar Davoudi is blatantly being punished for his work defending human rights.
“Setting up a Telegram channel to expose human rights violations is not a crime. The Iranian authorities must release Armisalar Davoudi immediately and unconditionally.
“Amirsalar Davoudi is the latest victim of a vicious crackdown waged by the Iranian authorities against human rights lawyers over the past two years, which has seen Iranian courts hand out increasingly harsh sentences to stop them
from being able to carry out their work.
“With this sentence, Iran’s authorities have demonstrated that human rights lawyers in Iran today are effectively treated as enemies of the state and that the authorities will go to any lengths to deny individuals in detention access to justice.”
Under Iran’s sentencing guidelines, Amirsalar Davoudi will have to serve 15 years of his prison sentence.
The news of his case follows the sentencing of prominent lawyer and women’s rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes, prompting an international outcry. In accordance with Iran’s sentencing guidelines, the actual term she has to serve is 17 years.
Amnesty International is calling for the international community, including EU states, which have an ongoing dialogue with Iran, to demand the authorities immediately stop targeting human rights lawyers. 
Background:
Amirsalar Davoudi was arrested on 20 November 2018 and has been detained in Tehran’s Evin prison with extremely limited access to his family and lawyer.
On 1 June 2019, his wife, Tannaz Kolahchian, announced on Twitter that he had been convicted by Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on multiple charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison and 111 lashes. The punishment of flogging violates the prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment under international law.
The charges on which he has been convicted include “insulting officials”, “insulting the Supreme Leader” and “spreading propaganda against the system”. In accordance with Article 134 of the penal code, which stipulates that, when individuals are convicted on three or more charges, they shall serve the lengthiest single sentence imposed for the most serious charge, the actual term he is due to serve is 15 years. The single lengthiest charge on which he was convicted was “forming a group with the purpose of disrupting national security”, relating to his Telegram channel.
Amirsalar Davoudi is well known for representing human rights activists and other individuals detained for their social and political activities.
In recent years, Iranian courts have handed out increasingly harsh sentences against human rights lawyers. Another lawyer, Mohammad Najafi, was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison and 74 lashes in three separate cases.
Other lawyers who have either been arrested or have faced prosecution since January 2018 include Arash Keykhosravi, Ghassem Sholeh-Sa’di, Farokh Forouzan, Mostafa Daneshjoo, Mostafa Tork Hamadani, Payam Derafshan and Zeynab Taheri.

The Trump administration is reportedly considering barring anyone who transits through a third country from seeking asylum at the US southern border. Such a policy would effectively block anyone other than Mexicans and Canadians from seeking asylum in the United States. In response, Charanya Krishnaswami, Advocacy Director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA, made the following statement:
“Seeking asylum is a human right, full stop.  This latest policy is a disgusting example of the lengths the Trump administration will go to deny people protection. Instead of taking sensible steps to fix this crisis of their own making, they choose to further their agenda of hate and fear against mothers, fathers, children, and anyone else who has been forced to flee their homes and who have no other way to seek safety. To effectively close the border to Central Americans and the vast majority of people seeking asylum not only violates human rights obligations, but is also fundamentally cruel.”
Background:
Amnesty International has made several missions to the border to document firsthand the human costs of the many barriers already in place against asylum-seekers. These include the practice of “metering,” which illegally keeps asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico for their turn to apply for asylum at ports-of-entry; and the dangerous “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forcibly returns them to harm’s way in Mexico while they fight for their right to seek asylum in the United States. Amnesty International has called for these harmful policies to end immediately.

Our organizations are deeply disappointed that the federal government has failed to take decisive action to guarantee that survivors of mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows will get the medical care they need and deserve. 
Although the federal Indigenous Services department had announced that Minister Seamus O’Regan would sign a memorandum of understanding with Grassy Narrows when he visited the northwestern Ontario First Nation yesterday, no such agreement was reached.
According to a statement released by the Grassy Narrows Chief and Council, negotiations are continuing around key needs of the community. This includes a call for the federal government to put the necessary funds for the construction and operation of a treatment centre into trust so that health of mercury survivors will be protected from shifting political winds.
In an open letter released on the eve of the Minister’s visit, Amnesty International Canada, the Council of Canadians and CUPE Ontario all supported the creation of such a trust fund as necessary step toward justice for Grassy Narrows.
Mercury contamination of the river system at Grassy Narrows has created one of the worst health crises facing any community in Canada. This health crisis has been prolonged and exacerbated by a half century of denial and delay by governments of all political stripes.
As negotiations proceed, our organizations want to remind the federal government that the urgency of providing quality, specialized health care for mercury survivors grows with each passing day.
It is essential that the Trudeau government make good on its promise to deal with the mercury crisis “once and for all.”
Our organizations will continue to stand with the people of Grassy Narrows until their rights to health and a healthy environment are finally respected and fulfilled.

“We are thrilled that two party leaders have committed to a leaders’ debate,” said Paulette Senior, CEO of the Canadian Women’s Foundation, a member of the Up for Debate coalition. “We welcome the commitment made by the Bloc Québécois today to discussing women’s rights and gender equality during the election campaign. We hope they will strengthen their commitment by agreeing to participate in a leaders’ debate on these issues.”
The Liberal and Conservative parties have not yet committed to participate in the Up for Debate campaign.
“Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed to participating in a federal leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality in the 2015 election campaign,” said Sandeep Prasad, Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “We hope that the Prime Minister, who self-identifies as a feminist, and Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer, will commit to a federal leaders’ debate on these issues without delay.”
Up for Debate, a non-partisan alliance of prominent national organizations promoting women’s rights and gender equality, urges all federal political party leaders to participate in this national debate, and to adopt strong women’s rights and gender equality policy statements in their party platforms including to: 
Remove barriers to economic equality by funding public services and social programs in Canada that help lift women and gender diverse people out of poverty;
Create a national action plan to prevent and address all forms of violence against women, girls and gender diverse people, including the extreme levels of violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people; and
Increase long-term core funding for women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations as well as to grassroots activist organizations, to enable them to carry out their vital work, which is proven to have a positive impact on the lives of women and gender diverse people.

In 2015, the Up for Debate coalition called for a national leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality. After securing commitments to debate from the leaders of the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party, Up for Debate switched strategies, and invited all party leaders to film one-on-one video interviews with leading feminist journalist, Francine Pelletier. The Conservatives declined to participate, but Up for Debate’s interviews with the other four federal party leaders were released nationally. The 2015 federal election produced a strong agenda on women’s rights and gender equality. There has been no leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality since 1984.

Peter Benenson had heard of the cases of two university students – arrested, tried and sentenced during what was at that time a cruel military dictatorship in Portugal – locked up simply because they had dared to raise their glasses of wine in a toast to freedom. 
Peter knew that what had befallen those two students was by no means exceptional, and that there were people in every corner of the world, jailed because of their political beliefs, their religious faith or the colour of their skin; prisoners of conscience as they came to be known.  Vitally, he also knew that he would not be alone in his sense of outrage.  
So Peter Benenson set out to harness that collective concern and turn it into a force for change; a force for justice. In 1961 he did not set out to found a global human rights movement.  Less ambitiously, but with a force of determination that soon involved countless others, he launched a year-long campaign for “amnesty” for those he called the forgotten prisoners, encouraging people to write polite letters to political leaders around the world, calling for freedom for women, men and young people who never should have been detained in the first place. 
Critics and naysayers thought that Peter Benenson was delusional. Why would people want to take time to write letters on behalf of people they had never met and never would, who lived in countries they would never visit?  And why would cruel despots care what a plumber in Manchester, office worker in Helsinki, grandmother in Melbourne or college student in Vancouver had to say? 
But Peter Benenson was not delusional; he and every activist who flocked to his campaign were in fact visionary.  People do care enough about the rights of others to write a letter; care deeply in fact.  And even tyrants worry about world opinion; not always, but frequently enough that we know that global pressure can and does make a difference in the face of grave human rights violations. 
Peter’s modest ambition of sustaining a year long campaign did grow into Amnesty International, which has grown to become the world’s largest human rights movement, has been honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize, and is present on the ground today in all corners of our globe.  
Here in Canada Amnesty International has 400,000 supporters who actively take up cases close to home, notably the pervasive human rights violations experienced by Indigenous peoples in the country; and campaign for an end to atrocities in countries such as Yemen and Myanmar and protection for courageous human rights defenders in countries like Colombia and Honduras. 
And 58 years later, sadly, Amnesty International has, in many respects, never been more important.  
Far too many countries continue to be devasted by the ravages of war and armed conflict, with an agonizing list in 2019 that includes Yemen, South Sudan, Syria, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Libya. 
Far too many politicians – including in the United States, Brazil, the Philippines and a growing number of European countries – win elections by promoting policies of hate, fear and division; with the most marginalized in our societies being targeted for threats and violence. 
Additionally, we know that the rapidly spiraling impacts of climate change pose what is fast becoming the most urgent human rights challenge of our time; yet continues to be met by denial and resistance by far too many governments and powerful economic interests. 
It may seem overwhelming.  It may very understandably lead to the question, what difference could I possibly make? Just as it did in 1961. 
And that is why the Amnesty International vision still holds true.  The problems are immense and may seem insurmountable.  But there is always one thing you can do right now to make a difference for one person, or for one community, or for one country.  And there is a friend, co-worker, neighbour, relative or fellow student who you can urge to join you in that effort; and another and another…  
That is where change comes from; it always has and always will. That is also the vision of the Sisters of St. Joseph community, a spirit of solidarity and collective responsibility that has been of such immense support to Amnesty International’s human rights efforts over the years. 
Today, we cherish that close connection; and together we renew our commitment.  Together, tomorrow and all the tomorrows to come: we will press on and we will not relent until the glorious promise of universal human rights protection is a reality for everyone, everywhere.

With less than five months until the fall election, supporters of the 2019 Up for Debate campaign are also urging federal party leaders to make real commitments to end poverty, end gender-based violence, and support women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations.
“We are back once again to ask each federal party leader, ‘Are you up for debate?’” said Paulette Senior, President and CEO of the Canadian Women’s Foundation, speaking on behalf of the Up for Debate coalition, which includes Amnesty International Canada, the Canadian Labour Congress, Oxfam Canada and YWCA Canada. “While we have seen some positive steps towards advancing gender rights, women and gender diverse people are still more likely to live in poverty and experience violence. We are calling on all leaders to put women’s rights and gender equality front and centre of this year’s election campaign.”
The last time a debate focused on women took place was in the federal election of 1984.
Despite increased attention to women’s rights and gender equality in recent years, First Nations, Métis and Inuit women are still six times more likely to be murdered than non-Indigenous women. Globally, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.  The Up for Debate coalition is calling on all federal political parties to commit to creating a National Action Plan to prevent and address all forms of violence against women, girls and gender diverse people, including Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.
“As we witness a crackdown on abortion rights in the United States, we must remember that we are not immune to the erosion of reproductive rights here in Canada,” said Sandeep Prasad, Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “Too many women and gender diverse people in Canada lack access to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual health services, including abortion. We need every political party to make strong commitments to women’s health rights in their election platforms.”
Further, women and gender diverse people are more likely to live in poverty and experience social and economic inequality, including the gender wage gap and other barriers to participating in the labour force. The Up for Debate coalition is calling on federal party leaders to adopt platforms that include universal childcare, affordable housing, and progressive immigration policies. This must be coupled by a commitment to increase long-term, core funding for women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations.
“Don’t get me wrong, we have welcomed the Canadian government’s funding increases to women’s rights and gender equality causes over the past four years. But unfortunately, it’s not enough,” said Julie Delahanty, Executive Director of Oxfam Canada. “Women’s rights and feminist organizations are still left scrambling to provide services to women and gender diverse people.”

Military units responsible for past atrocities are committing war crimes, while deployment of additional units suggests involvement of senior generals
International community is failing – ICC referral urgently needed 
Following a recent investigation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, Amnesty International has gathered new evidence that the Myanmar military is committing war crimes and other human rights violations. The military operation is ongoing, raising the prospect of additional crimes being committed.
The new report, “No one can protect us”: War crimes and abuses in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, details how the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadaw, have killed and injured civilians in indiscriminate attacks since January 2019. The Tatmadaw forces have also carried out extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances.
The report examines the period of intense military operations that followed coordinated attacks on police posts by the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic Rakhine armed group, on 4 January 2019. The new operation followed a government instruction to ‘crush’ the AA.
“Less than two years since the world outrage over the mass atrocities committed against the Rohingya population, the Myanmar military is again committing horrific abuses against ethnic groups in Rakhine State” said Nicholas Bequelin, Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia at Amnesty International. “The new operations in Rakhine State show an unrepentant, unreformed and unaccountable military terrorizing civilians and committing widespread violations as a deliberate tactic.”
Amnesty International conducted 81interviews, including 54 interviews on the ground in Rakhine State in late March 2019 and 27 remote interviews with people living in conflict-affected areas. They included ethnic Rakhine, Mro, Rohingya and Khami villagers, belonging to the Buddhist, Christian and Muslim faiths. The organization also reviewed photographs, videos and satellite imagery, and interviewed humanitarian officials, human rights activists and other experts.
While ethnic Rakhine communities have long fostered political grievances against Myanmar’s central government, the AA is led by a younger generation of ethnic Rakhine nationalists. Today the AA is estimated to have a fighting force of up to 7,000 troops. Established in 2009, it has fought alongside other thnic armed organizations in northern Myanmar and in recent years has clashed sporadically with the military in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin State. Fighting intensified in late 2018.
Newly-deployed units, same pattern of atrocities
Amnesty International’s new report uncovers evidence of abuses committed by military troops implicated in past atrocity crimes, including specific divisions and battalions under the Western Command. Amnesty International has further confirmed that newly-deployed units from the 22nd and 55th Light Infantry Divisions (LIDs) are responsible for many of these fresh violations.
From interviews and other evidence, including satellite imagery, Amnesty International documented seven unlawful attacks which killed 14 civilians and injured at least 29 more. Most of these attacks were indiscriminate, and some may have been direct attacks on civilians. In one incident in late January, a seven-year-old ethnic Rakhine boy died after a mortar that almost certainly was fired by the Myanmar military exploded in Tha Mee Hla village, Rathedaung Township, during fighting between the military and the AA. Although the boy was severely injured, it took several hours before Myanmar soldiers gave his family permission to take him to a hospital. He died the following day.
In another incident in mid-March, a Myanmar military mortar exploded in Ywar Haung Taw village, Mrauk-U Township, injuring at least four people and destroying a house belonging to Hla Shwe Maung, a 37-year-old ethnic Rakhine man. He recalled, “I heard an explosion. It was very loud and there was a big fireball that fell around us… I grabbed my daughter in my arms… [when] we looked back half of our house’s roof was gone.”
Review of satellite imagery confirms the destruction of a building in Ywar Haung Taw village, as well as the presence of new artillery at the police base close by.
While ethnic Rakhine communities have borne the brunt of violations committed by the Myanmar military in this campaign, other communities, including the Rohingya, have also suffered. On 3 April 2019, a military helicopter opened fire on Rohingya labourers cutting bamboo, killing at least six men and boys and injuring at least 13 others. “The helicopter came from behind the mountain,” a survivor of the attack told Amnesty International. “Within minutes it fired rockets. I was running for my life thinking about my family and how I would survive.” Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians are war crimes.
Amnesty International also documented how the military has taken positions within ancient temple complexes of Mrauk-U and fired recklessly in the area. Satellite imagery confirms the presence of artillery close to the temples, and photographs show destruction of temple sites. While the organization has not been able to determine who was responsible for the attacks, by basing themselves close to the monuments, the Myanmar Army exposed historical and cultural property to destruction and damage, which violates international humanitarian law.
Amnesty International further documented seven cases of arbitrary arrest in Rakhine State since January 2019. These arrests were exclusively of men, usually ethnic Rakhine men of fighting age, and were often accompanied by torture and other ill-treatment aimed at obtaining information about the AA. A 33-year-old ethnic Rakhine man recalled, “[The soldier] asked, ‘Where do the AA keep their weapons?’ I replied ‘I don’t know, I’m not AA’… I remember a punch and a kick, then they hit my head with a rifle… I tried to cover my head with my hands but they started kicking and beating [me]. There was blood on my hands, face and head.”
Amnesty International also documented the enforced disappearance of six men – one ethnic Mro and five ethnic Rakhine – in mid-February. A witness said she last saw one of the men in military custody. Since then, families have had no information about their loved ones’ fate and whereabouts.
More than 30,000 people have been displaced in this latest violence, however the Myanmar authorities have blocked humanitarian access to the affected areas.
“The authorities are compounding the misery of civilians by blocking the supply of medicine, food and humanitarian relief to those in need, including children,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Civilians in Rakhine State are paying the heaviest price from the military’s assaults and their aftermath – yet the government continues to choose to remain silent about this spiralling crisis.”
Arakan Army abuses
While the Myanmar military was responsible for the overwhelming majority of violations documented by Amnesty International, the AA has also committed abuses against civilians, including abductions, the report shows. On 3 May AA fighters abducted four ethnic Rohingya men from Sin Khone Taing village, Rathedaung Township. According to a source with direct knowledge of the incident, four were taken to a remote location in the forest. In early February, the AA abducted 53 people from a village in neighbouring Chin State. According to a credible source, the group of women, men, and children were taken to an AA base near the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, where men were forced to porter and build shelters. Two subsequently escaped, however the fate and whereabouts of the others remains unknown.
AA soldiers have endangered civilians, at times conducting operations in a manner that has placed civilian villagers at risk of harm. The AA has also threatened and intimidated village administrators and local businesspeople, warning them in letters against interfering with the group’s activities. The letters were each accompanied by a bullet and bore the AA’s official seal.
Threats to freedom of expression
As reports of military violations mount, the security forces have resorted to tried and tested tactics to silence critical reporting, filing criminal complaints in recent months against the editors of three local Myanmar-language news outlets.
“While earlier this month the authorities finally released Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo after arbitrarily detaining them for more than 500 days, the global indignation over their case hasn’t stopped the authorities using the same fear tactics to make an example of others,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
“The NLD-led government has the power to change this. It holds a parliamentary majority and must use it to repeal or reform the repressive laws so often used against journalists.”
Time to step up international pressure
The latest military operation in Rakhine State was launched less than 18 months after the Myanmar security forces perpetrated crimes against humanity against the Rohingya population. More than 900,000 Rohingya refugees are still living in camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, and Amnesty’s new report provides yet more evidence that it is not safe for them to return.
This fresh evidence lends even greater urgency for the UN to act on the full range of atrocity crimes committed by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State and in northern Myanmar’s Kachin and Shan States. A UN Fact Finding Mission has called for senior military officials to be investigated and tried for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.
In the absence of any domestic accountability, Amnesty International is calling on the UN Security Council to urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court and impose a comprehensive arms embargo. Myanmar’s international partners must also rethink their relations with the Myanmar military leadership and implement targeted sanctions against senior officials through multilateral bodies like the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations.
“With Myanmar’s military committing atrocities as brazenly as ever, it’s clear international pressure needs to intensify,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Again and again, the international community has failed to stop the Myanmar military’s crimes and protect the civilian population. The Security Council was established to respond to exactly these kinds of situations, it’s time it took its responsibility seriously.”

The organization has gathered evidence including testimony from three eyewitnesses, a first-aid volunteer, two family members, two lawyers and a doctor which suggests Ramzi’s death on 19 April resulted from the injuries he sustained after being beaten by the police with baton sticks.
According to the information available to Amnesty International, Ramzi was beaten on the head by police as he was about to head home after attending anti-government protests in central Algiers that were dispersed by security forces using teargas and water cannons on 12 April 2019.
“Eyewitness accounts strongly suggest that Ramzi Yettou was brutally beaten on the head by police, causing injuries that appear to have led to his death. Algeria’s authorities have a dire track record of not holding members of the security forces to account for human rights violations, which makes it all the more crucial for them to ensure that the investigation into Ramzi’s death is meaningful,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International reviewed a copy of a police report authorizing Ramzi’s burial which cited the cause of death as “undetermined”, prompting Algeria’s prosecutor to order an investigation into the circumstances of his death.
“Ordering an investigation into Ramzi Yettou’s death is only the first step towards justice. It is crucial that the investigation is independent, impartial and effective and that police officers involved are suspended while the investigation is ongoing. Failing to hold the perpetrators behind Ramzi Yettou’s death to account will only embolden the police and send the message that they are free to operate above the law and that they can commit crimes without facing any consequences.”
Ramzi was about to head home to the town of Bougara (Blida) after attending a protest in Algiers on the afternoon of 12 April with approximately five friends. Police stopped the truck they were travelling in after the driver attempted to drive down a street in the wrong direction. when the police attacked them, some of the group managed to flee and others were beaten with sticks.
Before he lost consciousness, Ramzi told a first aid volunteer who found him lying on the ground with blood on his jacket that he had been beaten by police. 
According to the volunteer, his nose was bruised, and he had a small superficial injury measuring around a centimeter under his eyebrows that was not bleeding. The first aid volunteer asked police to call an ambulance, which arrived around 30 minutes later and transferred him to the Mustapha Bacha hospital where he underwent head surgery because of internal bleeding. He never regained consciousness and died on Friday 19 April.
Ramzi and his friends made the 50 km trip to Algiers every Friday to protest since demonstrations against the country’s ruling elite and political system started earlier this year.

Over recent weeks, police have detained, placed under house arrest or threatened dozens of activists who are seeking to mark the June 4 anniversary, as well as relatives of those killed.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters and civilians were killed when soldiers opened fire in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on 3–4 June 1989, as they sought to crush widespread protests calling for political reform.
“Thirty years on from the Tiananmen bloodshed the very least the victims and their families deserve is justice. However, President Xi continues to read from the same tired political playbook, cruelly persecuting those seeking the truth about the tragedy in a concerted effort to wipe the June 4 crackdown from memory,” said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director of Amnesty International.
“The Chinese government must accept that no amount of suppression will ever erase the horror of the wholesale slaughter that took place in and around Tiananmen Square. A first step towards justice would be to finally allow people in China, including elderly parents whose children were killed in the crackdown, to commemorate the victims of June 4.”
Censorship
Any references to the Tiananmen crackdown continue to be systematically censored in China. Anyone who seeks to commemorate the victims does so at great personal risk and is likely to be harassed or detained. 
In April, activist Chen Bing was sentenced to three and a half years in jail after he and three other activists – Fu Hailu, Luo Fuyu and Zhang Junyong – were found guilty of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for their unique commemoration of the Tiananmen anniversary on special bottles of a Chinese liquor.
Sichuan activist Deng Chuanbin was placed under criminal detention on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” on 18 May. His detention is believed to relate to a tweet he posted commemorating the Tiananmen protests.
On 20 May, police ordered 82-year old Ding Zilin, whose then-17-year-old son Jiang Jielian was killed by troops during the June 4 crackdown, to leave her home in Beijing and travel more than 1,100km to her hometown Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. This is a common tactic the authorities use against activists in an effort to silence them during politically sensitive periods and to make it less likely they will speak with foreign media.
Ding Zilin is a founding member of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of families of victims who are seeking an investigation into the June 4 bloodshed. Other members of the group have also been placed under police surveillance in recent weeks.
The suppression of those seeking to publicly mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown is the latest in a wider assault against activists in China. Under President Xi’s rule, the Chinese authorities have decimated the ranks of human rights lawyers and activists calling for political and legal reforms. The relentless crackdown has been marked by arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, torture and other ill-treatment.
“Time is running out for the elderly parents whose children were murdered to see truth and justice. We urge the Chinese authorities to do the decent thing and launch an open and independent investigation into the violent crackdown of 1989,” said Roseann Rife.
Amnesty International reiterates its calls on the Chinese government to:
– Publicly acknowledge the human rights violations which occurred in the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989; 
– Launch an open and independent inquiry and hold those responsible for human rights violations accountable;
– Provide compensation to victims of the 1989 crackdown and their families;
– Cease harassment and prosecution of those commemorating or speaking out about the 1989 Tiananmen protests and those more generally exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.

Maude Barlow, Honourary Chairperson of the Council of Canadians, said, “The people of Grassy Narrows have already had to wait decades too long for the medical care they need and deserve. It is unconscionable that they should continue to wait for the government to fulfill its promise while their family members die or languish without adequate care.”
More than two years ago, in January 2017, the Prime Minister’s office said that the Trudeau government would deal with the mercury crisis at Grassy Narrows “once and for all.”  In November 2017, the federal government promised to build and operate a care home and treatment facility for mercury survivors in Grassy Narrows. More than 500 days later, only 1% of the promised money has been spent to build the facility, the ground has not been broken, and the Chief and Council of Grassy Narrows reports that the project is at a stand still.
The Open Letter supports the Grassy Narrows First Nation’s call for funds for the care home and treatment centre to be put in trust for the community as the only way to ensure that Trudeau government’s promise is kept no matter the outcome of the upcoming federal election.
“What the people of Grassy Narrows are asking for is a matter of justice and basic human rights,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada. “For decades, the federal and provincial government have simply denied the consequences of the poisoning of the waters on the health of Grass Narrows people. It’s past time that proper care for Grassy Narrows elders and other mercury survivors be treated as a matter of urgent national priority.”
On March 29, Minister O’Regan is visiting the First Nation, a promise he made in March, shortly after Prime Minister Trudeau apologized for a dismissive remark to a Grassy Narrows supporter that was widely circulated on social media.
“At this point, the onus is on the Trudeau government to demonstrate that this trip is about more than repairing the Liberal brand,” said Fred Hahn, President of CUPE Ontario. “A half-century of neglect and cover-up promotes cynicism. So long as the government fails to deliver decisively on its promises, that cynicism can only deepen with each day that passes.”
Quality, specialized care for mercury survivors is among the recommendations of a detailed health assessment that has been carried out by Dr. Donna Mergler, a renowned expert on mercury poisoning and community health.
The people of Grassy Narrows have been very clear that they need specialized facilities to care for the survivors of mercury poisoning in their community. This is what the Trudeau government promised. This is what Minister O’Regan needs to deliver.

We must demand their protection and rights now. 
Amnesty International documented the stories of women that have been subjected to these abuses in “If they can have her, why can’t we?,” a report published in April 2019. 
In this video, Luna explains how transphobia and homophobia in the Dominican Republic influence particular forms of gender-based violence against people like her, engaged in sex work, and how their activism has helped to bring about change. 
 
Gender-based violence in Latin America and the Caribbean is an epidemic. In 2017 alone, in the Dominican Republic there were 6,300 reports of sexual offences, 1,290 were rapes. In 2018 at least 100 women were killed because of their gender (femicide), making this one of the highest rates in the region. 
Women who engage in sex work are particularly vulnerable to gender-based abuse by state and private actors. 
According to our research, police in the Dominican Republic routinely rape, humiliate, torture and otherwise mistreat women engaged in sex work. 
“If you do sex work, they (the police) consider you as the worst kind of woman…They (the police) pull your hair, they hit you, and push you. They treat you like a dog. As if we are dogs in the street, with four paws… They call you ‘dirty whore’, that’s normal.” 
This is a situation frequently experienced by sex workers across the country and occurs due to a deeply engrained culture of machismo within the National Police, in addition to discrimination and stigma against sex workers in a conservative society. 
Despite the fact that the attacks perpetrated against sex workers by the police in the Dominican Republic may qualify as torture or ill-treatment – crimes under international law – police are rarely punished for these acts. 
Many women engaged in sex work don’t report crimes against them because they fear humiliation or retribution. 
“Accusing a police (officer) is to do nothing, because they (the authorities) don’t do anything.” 
Those that do file reports against police are rarely taken seriously. 
Women engaged in sex work with multiple discriminated identities, such as transgender or afro-descendent sex workers, suffer particularly brutal forms of abuse, as punishment for not conforming to traditional social norms. 
Transgender sex workers, for example, report that police often remove and burn their wigs as a form of humiliation, while others report that they have been forced to clean prison toilets covered in excrement. 
“They said I was a man, ‘a damn fag, a fag from hell’. With obscene words they said: ‘Look at those tits of sponge, take off her hair, take away those cloths that she has on her tits.’ They took down my pants to see if I had a vulva or a penis.” -A transgender sex worker describing an interaction with police in Santo Domingo. 
Women who engage in sex work in the Dominican Republic are at the receiving end of violence and discrimination, but many of them also find the courage to lead groups and organizations finding strength in unity to stand up for their humanity and against these attacks. Even then, they find themselves questioned as women human rights defenders based on their gender and their occupation as sex workers causing them to be excluded from broader movements across the globe. Still, organizations like Otrasex, CONTRAVETD, and TRANSSA continue to fight to transform the world around them in Dominican Republic. 
“This country has the most violence against women, because if you report a man who mistreats us, they don’t do anything. He could even kill us. This should change. There shouldn’t be so much violence against women and sex workers, because I do it because I like it, and besides that’s my livelihood for my children, and it’s my only source of work.”  
To ensure respect for the rights of women engaged in sex work, the Dominican Republic must: 
Publicly recognize rape by police as torture and make clear that all those responsible for such acts will be brought to justice; 
Ensure the investigation, prosecution and punishment of police that are accused and found guilty of these crimes; and 
Pass anti-discrimination legislation and adopt other measures to protect and promote the rights of marginalized groups.

There is an enormous amount of consequential human rights legislation approaching the parliamentary finish line. The time to get it across shrinks daily. 
Only four sitting weeks remain in this session of Parliament for MPs, five for Senators. Rather than return to Parliament in the fall, MPs will be out hustling for votes. That means parliamentary business not concluded by the House of Commons and Senate’s last sitting days, currently June 21 and 28 respectively, will, as is said, “die on the order paper.” Bills not adopted, orders-in-council not approved, and ministerial decisions not authorized will await whatever the next Parliament holds. 
Here are 12 bills and decisions being watched closely by Indigenous peoples, human rights groups, and communities across the country. 
Bill C-262 would set a framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission stated provides “the necessary principles, norms, and standards for reconciliation to flourish in 21st-century Canada.” It was introduced in April 2016 by NDP MP Romeo Saganash and embraced by the government in November 2017. It has been in the Senate for the past year and faced delays from several Conservative Senators. There is enough time for Senators to pass C-262, but it is tight. 
Also facing a rough ride in the Senate is Bill C-69, which includes important provisions to assess the positive and negative human rights impacts of resource development projects on Indigenous peoples and people of different genders. It has become a flashpoint in the politicized debate about pipelines and climate change. After extensive cross-country Senate hearings and hundreds of amendments proposed by Senators, it is unclear if enough time remains for the bill to be reviewed and become law. 
The Senate is seized with C-59 and C-83, reforms to national security and solitary confinement. Each one fixes long-standing human rights concerns to a degree, but leaves major shortcomings unaddressed and introduces new human rights problems. Human rights groups have proposed amendments, but with pressure on Senators to get bills done, worries mount that any improvements will be limited. 
That was the fate of Bill C-85, updating the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, quickly passed by the Senate May 9 and awaiting the Governor General’s signature. It remains without crucial amendments to exempt goods and services originating in illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.

The Hill Times photograph by Andrew Meade 
Bills C-91 and C-92, while neither perfect, would institute sorely needed human rights protections with respect to Indigenous languages and Indigenous children. They were introduced in the House in February and will require exemplary co-operation from MPs and Senators to be adopted. 
Bill C-97, omnibus budget implementation legislation, is a mixed human rights story. It includes a proposal to curtail access to independent hearings for refugee claimants who have made previous claims in a number of countries, including the United States, which is hardly a safe country for refugees under Donald Trump’s administration. The government has rebuffed calls to withdraw that provision. 
Bill C-97 also promises a long-awaited human rights-based national housing strategy. Advocates have proposed amendments to strengthen that strategy. If adopted, this would be groundbreaking recognition of homelessness and housing as the human rights issue it is. 
On May 7, the government introduced Bill C-98, to establish independent review and oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency’s considerable arrest and detention powers. Without unanimous agreement, it is unlikely C-98 can be adopted before Parliament concludes. 
Then there is cabinet business. In January 2018, the government announced the establishment of a new ombudsperson to investigate alleged human rights abuses associated with Canadian companies operating abroad. The first ombudsperson, Sheri Meyerhoffer, was appointed last month. Whether she will be granted powers needed to investigate awaits a cabinet decision. 
The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women’s final report will be released on June 3. As a next step, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett should implement the national inquiry’s call to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the federal election, to end sex discrimination in the Indian Act. There must also be comprehensive action underway before Parliament winds down. Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people cannot endure further uncertain waiting for the government to uphold their rights. 
It is crucial that ministers, MPs, and Senators use each hour of every day of these remaining weeks to the maximum advantage and advance these crucial human rights reforms.

The two, Stabile Dewah (35) and Rita Nyamupinga (61), bring to seven the number of human rights defenders arrested at Robert Mugabe International Airport in the past seven days as they returned from a capacity-building workshop on non-violent protest tactics in the Maldives.
“The first five human rights defenders arrested are facing trumped up charges for exercising their human rights. They should be released immediately and unconditionally. The charges against them fit into a much wider pattern of repression we have documented in Zimbabwe,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
The first batch of activists – George Makoni, Tatenda Mombeyarara, Gamuchirai Mukura, Nyasha Mpahlo and Farirai Gumbonzvanda – have been accused of “plotting to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government”. The two activists arrested today are also likely to be charged with subverting a constitutional government.
“Since January’s protests we have witnessed a mounting crackdown on human rights defenders and activists. Lawyers, journalists and even medical doctors have not been spared. Zimbabwe’s authorities have declared anyone who exercises their right to freedom expression and association an enemy of the state. This witch-hunt must stop,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
The first four of the human rights defenders were arrested as they disembarked from their flight on 20 May. Farirai Gumbonzvanda was also arrested at the Harare airport on 21 May at around 16:00 hours local time.
Authorities accused them of attending a workshop organised by a Serbian NGO in the Maldives called the Centre for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies (CANVAS).
They were formally charged with plotting to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government on 21 May and remanded to Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison.
Police confiscated their laptops and mobile phones, which were reportedly handed over to the Postal and Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe “for extraction of evidence”. The evidence, including some notes recorded during the meeting, will be produced in court as evidence against the activists.
“Zimbabwean authorities must stop using trumped-up charges to intimidate and harass human rights defenders and civil society leaders. The rights to freedom of expression and association are not just ‘nice to have’ constitutional requirements; they are legal human rights that all Zimbabweans must live and enjoy every day,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
Background
On Wednesday 17 May, the government used the state-owned and controlled Herald Newspaper to accuse civil society organizations of “plotting to unleash violent protest” in Zimbabwe, citing the meeting that the activists had attended.
The rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression have been under attack in the country since January, after fuel price hikes saw the cost of living skyrocket with basic commodities becoming too expensive for the ordinary man.

Two parliamentarians affiliated to the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) were leading a procession of activists to the Khar Kamar area of North Waziristan, along the Afghan border, when firing broke out, leading to the deaths.
One of the parliamentarians, Ali Wazir, is currently in custody of the Pakistani military. There are conflicting accounts of the incident, with the military claiming that PTM activists assaulted a checkpoint and PTM activists insisting that no shots were fired from their side. Phone and internet services were shut down after this incident, adding to the confusion.
“The Pakistan government must immediately order an independent and effective investigation into the killing of activists on Sunday in North Waziristan. If the reports are correct that the army killed protestors by unlawfully using live ammunition, this would be a very serious violation of international law,” said Rabia Mehmood, South Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Under international law, lethal force can only ever be used by law enforcement authorities when strictly necessary to protect life. When lethal force has been used, every incident should be fully investigated to determine if there was any use of excessive force and if any resulting killing was unlawful. Those found responsible for the use of excessive force or for unlawful killings should be brought to justice through fair trials without resort to the death penalty.”
 
Background
The PTM is a movement that says it uses non-violent means to campaign against extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations suffered by Pakistan’s Pashtun ethnic minority. In the past, senior government officials – including Prime Minister Imran Khan and army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa – have said they recognize and sympathize with the PTM’s grievances.
Despite these statements, however, the Pakistani authorities have intensified a crackdown against the group. Dozens of its supporters have been arrested, arbitrarily detained, subject to surveillance and intimidation, and even threatened with violence. Across the country, their rallies have been banned or disrupted, denying them the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.
On 2 February 2019, Arman Luni, a PTM activist from Baluchistan, was killed at a protest in Lorelai. Eyewitnesses say that he was in police custody at the time. Luni’s family struggled to have a police complaint filed about his murder.

Responding to reports that President Trump will attempt to exploit loopholes to continue sending arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE without Congressional approval, Philippe Nassif, the advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International USA said:
“The Trump administration must stop supplying arms to the Saudi-led coalition, which has repeatedly committed horrific violations in Yemen, some amounting to war crimes, devastating the lives of thousands.
“This administration has made clear its desire to sell more weapons without concern for human rights. We know arms manufactured in the United States have been used in deadly strikes against civilians. U.S. munitions have been found in the remains of bombed homes, hospitals and hotels throughout Yemen’s devastating war, killing almost 7,000 people.”
Amnesty International USA is calling on Congress to end U.S support for the Saudi-led Coalition’s conduct in Yemen and demand a pre-delivery notification before any weapons are transferred to Saudi Arabia. Congress should immediately consider measures to halt arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia and other countries that have already demonstrated a record of misusing them in Yemen.
Background:
Since the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign of airstrikes against the Huthi armed group began on March 25, 2015, Amnesty International has documented how all parties to the conflict have repeatedly violated international law. There is extensive evidence that irresponsible arms flows to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition have resulted in enormous harm to Yemeni civilians

Spotlight on the ‘unjustifiable neglect’ of Northern Ireland – still governed by one of the world’s strictest abortion laws
New short film ‘Story of Repeal’ tells story of campaigners, politicians, and women who have bravely spoken out in Ireland 
 Trailer for film available here, pictures and b-roll available to download here.
 One year on since Ireland’s vote to end its abortion ban, Amnesty International is paying tribute to the brave campaigners who spoke out for reproductive rights and sending messages of hope to people in Northern Ireland who are still subject to one of the strictest abortion bans in the world.
Today Amnesty International has released a powerful short film, ‘Story of Repeal’; featuring leading activists, campaigners, politicians, and women who had bravely spoken out.
The film coincides with giant ‘Now For Northern Ireland’ projections which lit up buildings across London, Belfast, Dublin, and Glasgow last night. 
Northern Ireland abortion ban
The ‘Now For Northern Ireland’ projections across London, Belfast, Dublin, and Glasgow shone a spotlight on the injustice of Northern Ireland’s strict near-total abortion ban, one year since Ireland’ voted to repeal the 8th Amendment (25-26 May).
The Amnesty International stunt drew attention to the UK Government’s inaction on reforming Northern Ireland’s abortion law, which remains one of the most restrictive in the world and carries the harshest criminal penalties in Europe. 
Today, the Isle of Man’s abortion reform is due to come into force, and this weekend marks one year since Ireland voted to end its near-total abortion ban. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland continues to be governed by a strict abortion law, which is more restrictive than most abortion laws currently being proposed and causing outrage across US states.
A giant heart – part of an Amnesty collaboration with Irish artist Maser, who re-worked his ‘Repeal the 8th’ artwork which became symbolic of the repeal campaign in Ireland to say ‘Now for Northern Ireland’ – was projected onto the Northern Ireland Office in Westminster, The Mac building in Belfast, the Mary Barbour statue in Glasgow, and the Project Art Centre in Dublin – where the original repeal mural was painted.  
Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International UK’s Northern Ireland campaign manager, said:
“It’s been a year since the incredible win for reproductive rights in Ireland. One year on, Northern Ireland remains isolated as the only part of the UK and Ireland without access to basic healthcare. 
“After Ireland’s vote there was so much hope that the UK Government would then act to change things in the North, but a year later we’re still waiting.
“These projections shine a spotlight on the unjustifiable neglect of people in Northern Ireland.
“Whilst dangerous roll-backs on reproductive rights are happening across US states, we must remember that our own Government is forcing its own citizens to live with these cruel laws.
“It’s time for the Government to end the harm and hurt caused by our inhumane and discriminatory near-total abortion ban.”
Artist Maser said: “By consciously making the Repeal artwork copyright free, the public were empowered to take ownership of it, I was a messenger watching from the side lines. With the people’s fierce collective energy, the artwork built huge momentum and spread across the state.
“Our friends in the north are now on their journey to revoke their outdated abortion laws. I am here to show my alliance, I am your defender.”
Repeal the 8th in Ireland
The powerful short film, ‘Story of Repeal’; is a timeline of the Eighth Amendment from 1983 to 2018, and tells the story of political and cultural change and the struggle for human rights.
Sorcha Tunney, Amnesty International Ireland’s It’s Time campaign coordinator, said:
“This historic referendum victory was the outcome of decades of campaigning by civil society. We are honoured to have played a part in recent years, and this film pays tribute to those that made it happen.
“Above all, the Yes vote happened because of women refusing to be silent anymore. Because Amanda Mellet and Siobhán Whelan took Ireland to a UN human rights body, and won. They shouldn’t have had to speak out about the pain and anguish they experienced, but they bravely did.
“Though the Yes vote was a huge victory, there is still so much more to do here and around the world. Changing the Irish constitution required a referendum but human rights shouldn’t come down to a vote. Northern Ireland is an example of where a government should take action for women’s rights but hasn’t. We say very clearly today – the North is next.”
The film will be available on www.itstime.ie at 00:01 on 25 May 2018.
Notes:
Whilst people in Ireland and in most of the UK now have access to free, safe and legal abortion, women in Northern Ireland are still subject to one of the strictest abortion bans in the world – punishable by life in prison. The UK Government has responsibility to ensure the human rights of all UK citizens, including those in Northern Ireland, are upheld yet has taken no action to reform Northern Ireland’s inhumane abortion law.
There is huge support for Westminster to reform Northern Ireland’s abortion law across UK and Northern Irish political parties, amongst the Northern Irish public and from human rights, medical and legal bodies. UN Committees and UK Supreme Court judges have said that Northern Ireland’s abortion law puts the UK in breach of its human rights commitments.
Last month, the Women and Equalities Committee launched the findings from their inquiry into Northern Ireland’s abortion law and urged the Government to take urgent action.

The organisation’s positions have been addressed to Bolsonaro in an open letter that the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, Jurema Werneck, and the Amnesty International Americas director, Erika Guevara-Rosas, intend to deliver to the president personally in Brasilia, where they will be seeking an audience with government representatives until Thursday 23 May. On Monday afternoon, the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a joint statement saying they were open to dialogue with Amnesty International.
Jurema Werneck said: “We were hoping the authorities would be more receptive and we also hope that the willingness to engage in dialogue expressed in the inter-ministerial statement becomes reality. We asked for a meeting with President Jair Bolsonaro, and he forwarded our request to the Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves. Of the six meetings we requested with the authorities, only two have been confirmed, and the Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves, told us we would be received by the Deputy National Secretary for General Protection, Dr Alexandre Magno, this week.”
“We also requested an audience with the minister Sergio Moro, and the President’s Chief of Staff, Onix Lorenzoni. Moro told us that he would not be available to see us, and we are still waiting to hear back from the Chief of Staff’s office. The only person who has agreed to speak with us is General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, head of the Secretariat of Government. We hope the meetings with Alexandre Magno and Santos Cruz will be beneficial in building a positive dialogue for human rights. We still hope that some other authorities, especially President Jair Bolsonaro, will be able to receive us to talk about issues relevant to the current situation in Brazil.”
Erika Guevara-Rosas reiterates the importance of governments engaging in dialogue with civil society.
“I think it is important for Bolsonaro and other authorities to show their willingness to talk about the human rights issues we raised yesterday, which are not only our concerns, but concerns shared by many organisations working to promote human rights and by Brazilian citizens. These are measures that threaten the rights of millions of people, especially indigenous and Quilombola people, women, black people, LGBTI people and human rights defenders. Our concerns and recommendations are all based on analysis of decrees and measures adopted or proposed by the government, in the light of the international commitments Brazil has made to defend human rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“What we are proposing are possible paths to a more inclusive country: a country for everyone. Demonstrating an openness to dialogue would be an important signal from the government of Brazil, South America’s largest country, in this period of major threats to and violations of human rights in the Americas”.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
This case involved two groups of people: one group had status under the Indian Act which they could not pass on to their children. The second group were not eligible for status at all. This situation resulted from provisions in the Indian Act that imposed rules on acquisition and conferral of status that were discriminatory.  
The first group is the Matson siblings, whose grandmother lost her status when she married a non-status man. While legislation later gave them section 6(2) status, they are currently unable to pass status on to children they have with a non-status person. Had their grandmother never lost her status through the discriminatory policy based on sex, they would have had section 6(1) status. That type of status could be passed on to their children without restriction. 
The second group is the Andrews family. Mr. Andrews’ father was voluntarily enfranchised before Mr. Andrews was born which meant Mr. Andrews was born without status. Although legislation introduced later tried to fix that problem, the changes left Mr. Andrews with section 6(2) status and his daughter without any status at all. Had Mr. Andrews’ father never lost status, Mr. Andrews would have been eligible for section 6(1) status and his daughter for section 6(2) status. 
The Canadian Human Rights Commission brought a challenge to the legislation to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on the Matsons’ and the Andrews’ behalf. The Commission argued that the law was discriminatory. The Tribunal ruled that it did not have the power to decide whether a law itself was discriminatory, but rather only whether a service was delivered in a discriminatory manner. The Commission applied for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision. The Tribunal’s decision was upheld by both, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal.  
On appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada, the decision was once again upheld. The Court agreed with the Tribunal that they were not empowered to adjudicate challenges to the validity of legislation, only claims of human rights-impairing service provision. The act of creating legislation, the Supreme Court held, is not a “service” within the meaning of section 5(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE 
In its factum, Amnesty International submitted that Canada’s international obligations must be respected in the interpretation and application of section 5(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the “CHRA”). A broad interpretation of the jurisdiction of human rights tribunals is essential to upholding Canada’s international obligations to provide effective remedies for human rights violations. In other words, Amnesty argued that the Tribunal should be found to have the jurisdiction to consider the validity of the legislation itself. Amnesty also submitted that the proper interpretation of s. 5(a) must respect the seriousness of the prohibition against both formal and substantive discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status, and the need for effective remedies where such discrimination occurs.  In addition, Amnesty International submitted that discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status in registration under the Indian Act violates Canada’s international human rights obligations. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
The Supreme Court found that the Tribunal’s decisions to dismiss the challenges were reasonable. The Court deferred to the Tribunal’s expertise over its home statute, the Canadian Human Rights Act,  determining whether the decisions made by the Tribunal were reasonable. The Tribunal had interpreted its power as being limited to decide if a “service” was being delivered in an unequal way, not whether the law itself was discriminatory. The applicants had brought a challenge to the Indian Act itself, charging that it was discriminatory. The Supreme Court found the Tribunal’s interpretation reasonable, and agreed that the applicants could still challenge the Indian Act under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

“If Congress passes this legislation, the National Guard will become an all-powerful security force, without independent scrutiny and with dangerous powers, such as the authority to detain migrants and to use force against public demonstrations it does not deem to be legitimate,” said Tania Reneaum, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico.
On Tuesday, 21 May, the Mexican Senate approved four laws on security as part of a legislative arrangement to create a new National Guard supported by the federal government. Although the new laws contain some positive measures on human rights protection, they also include a series of challenges and serious flaws that could lead to an increase in abuses in a country that has been plagued for more than a decade by security crises and human rights violations.
“Members of the Senate publicly stated that Amnesty International’s recommendations were incorporated into the drafts they were discussing and which had remained secret until now. However, there are flaws in the legislation that Amnesty International could have pointed out if the Senate had allowed the effective participation of civil society organizations,” said Tania Reneaum.
Amnesty International is concerned that several provisions included in the legislation are contrary to human rights law and standards. Among these are the absence of independent mechanisms to monitor the actions of the police and the National Guard and the lack of safeguards restricting the use of force during demonstrations. For example, the law would authorize the use of force against protests that do not have a “legitimate purpose” (“objeto licito”) and gives the security forces themselves, including the National Guard, the power to assess whether or not a protest is legitimate.
The presentation of the long-awaited law on the use of force has been overshadowed by contradictions in the text and technical errors that range from incorrect definitions of the use of force and types of weapons to insufficient preconditions for the authorization of the use of lethal force. The law has a dangerous list of types of conduct that would authorize the use of lethal force without higher oversight and without requiring that the decision take into account the circumstances of each case.
Amnesty International notes with concern that, while the legislation mentions the principles that should govern the use of force – namely, legality, absolute necessity, proportionality and accountability – their definition is not consistent with international standards and their application is problematic and contradictory as some articles of the law appear to set a lower level of protection of human rights.
The organization welcomes the creation of a register of detentions, which could be an important step in preventing arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations, such as torture and enforced disappearances. The organization will continue to monitor closely both its implementation and the creation, provided for in the same law, of a record of detentions of migrants, which must be in line with international standards for their protection.
“We regret the haste and lack of transparency with which the Senate approved these laws, without making the drafts public, which prevented human rights defenders, civil society organizations, international human rights organizations and other experts from providing timely contributions. This is an error that the Chamber of Deputies can rectify to ensure the greatest protection for human rights and, to that end, Amnesty International is willing to provide technical input to the legislative process,” said Tania Reneaum.
The laws approved by the Senate are the Law on the National Guard, the National Law on the Use of Force, the National Law on the Register of Detentions and amendments to the General Law on the National Public Security System. These laws must be discussed by the Chamber of Deputies before final approval. Amnesty International urges members of the Chamber of Deputies to adopt the necessary amendments so that these laws are in line with international human rights law.

“The U.S. government is legally required to prevent the arbitrary deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in border areas. Yet instead, authorities have willfully destroyed humanitarian aid provisions in deadly desert terrain and are criminally prosecuting humanitarian volunteers in order to deter them from saving lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The U.S. government is prosecuting Dr. Warren for allegedly “harbouring” two undocumented migrants by providing them with humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, and clean clothing, in the desert town of Ajo, Arizona, where he lives. If convicted on all three criminal charges against him, Dr. Warren could face up to 20 years in prison. His felony trial is scheduled to begin on 29 May.
Amnesty International has sent an open letter to U.S. authorities as part of an international campaign calling for the charges against Dr. Warren to be dropped.
“Providing humanitarian aid is never a crime. If Dr. Warren were convicted and imprisoned on these absurd charges, he would be a prisoner of conscience, detained for his volunteer activities motivated by humanitarian principles and his religious beliefs,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Amnesty International opposed similar criminal prosecutions of humanitarian volunteers in Arizona 15 years ago, and we will continue to do so as long as necessary, until the government stops abusing its power. The U.S. government should immediately adopt and implement exemptions from criminal prosecution under ‘smuggling’ and ‘harboring’ charges, for the provision of humanitarian aid.”
Earlier in 2019, Dr. Warren and eight other volunteers with the organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes were also prosecuted for misdemeanor charges of littering and trespassing, specifically for leaving water and other humanitarian aid in desert areas where migrants have frequently died.
Arizona has the deadliest border area in the USA, accounting for 38.3 percent of the 7,242 border deaths recorded by U.S. border authorities over the last 20 years. The actual number of deaths is likely higher, as local media and organizations have sometimes counted more than official statistics, and border authorities have not always registered or collected the remains of bodies reported to them by volunteers.
Amnesty International acknowledges the volunteer activities of Dr. Warren and his associated organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, as vital humanitarian aid directed at upholding the right to life and preventing the deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in the Sonoran Desert.

Ahead of the inauguration, Shenilla Mohamed, Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa said:
“As his African National Congress prepares to lead the country for the next five years, Cyril Ramaphosa must place human rights at the centre of the government’s domestic and foreign policy priorities. This begins with ensuring justice for victims of the events in Marikana, who are still waiting for answers almost seven years on.
“Cyril Ramaphosa should publicly commit to ensuring full respect for the human rights, dignity and equality of all South Africans – the principles on which the country was founded as enshrined in the bill of rights.
“He should draw inspiration from Nelson Mandela who stood with human rights even when it was unpopular to do so, and did not shy away from calling out leaders who found themselves on the wrong side of humanity.”
Background
The ruling Africa National Congress (ANC) emerged victorious following the general elections that were held on 8 May 2019. Cyril Ramaphosa will lead the country for the next five years as the leader of the party.
In its human rights  manifesto for political parties and candidates who contested the election, Amnesty International South Africa called for human rights to form the basis of the incoming  government.
On 16 August 2012, the South Africa Police Service fatally shot 34 men at Marikana. 10 others died in the preceding days, including policemen.  More than 70 others sustained serious injuries. The men were Lonmin employees and had been engaged in strike and protest action over pay and conditions at the mine.

“Today’s inexplicable decision by Turkey’s highest court rubs salt into the wound of injustice. Osman Kavala’s rights have been abused. He should not have spent a single day behind bars, let alone nearly 600 days. The charges against him must be dropped and he must be immediately released.”
“The outlandish allegations against Osman Kavala are an attempt to rewrite history and to silence one of Turkey’s most prominent civil society figures.
“Yet again, following a decision earlier this month to reject the applications of jailed journalists Ahmet Altan and Nazlı Ilıcak, the Constitutional Court’s decision has prolonged the detention of someone who should never have been imprisoned in the first place.
“All eyes now turn to the European Court of Human Rights, which is currently considering Osman Kavala’s case and must urgently remedy this travesty of justice.”

Background
Osman Kavala was detained by the police in Istanbul on 18 October 2017 and then remanded in prison pending trial by a court decision on 1 November for ‘attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, attempting to overthrow the government of the Turkish republic or to prevent it from performing its duties’. In the following days and weeks, a smear campaign was mounted against him in the pro-government media using details leaked from the investigation. These media reports alleged that Osman Kavala was questioned about having links with the alleged organizers of the July 2016 failed coup attempt.
After 2 years in detention, the smear campaign in the pro-government media focused on Kavala’s contribution to the Gezi Park protests and claimed that he financed the protest and tried to spread it to other cities in Turkey.
Osman Kavala is among 16 defendants who are facing serious charges that carry the most severe sentence in Turkey criminal law – life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The indictment in the case dated 19 February 2019 was accepted on 4 March 2019 by the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 30. The first hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 24 and 25 June 2019 at Silivri prison where he and another defendant, Yigit Aksakoglu are being held.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
Tusif Ur Rehman Chhina is a man of Pakistani origin who was held for over 2 years in immigration detention, since November 2015. During that time, his detention was reviewed 12 times under the mechanism put in place by the federal Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, yet he was kept in detention because the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) believed that detention was necessary in order to eventually deport him even though there were alternatives to detention presented. 
When Mr. Chhina, who was being held in Alberta, applied to Court to have the legality of his detention reviewed, the Court declined to hear the case stating that the existing federal statutory mechanism was sufficient. The Alberta Court of Appeal subsequently overturned that decision, underscoring the importance of the right to habeas corpus, which requires a judge or Court to review the detention. The federal government has appealed this decision before the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”) provides a review of immigration detention that is complete, comprehensive and expert and as such, that there is no basis in law to find that habeas corpus is a route by which immigration detainees can, as of right, challenge the legality of their detention in a superior court. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S INTERVENTION 
Amnesty International argued that the broad right to challenge one’s detention by way of habeas corpus extends to immigration detention, that this challenge must be heard before a court, not a ministerial official, and that Canada is under international legal obligations to guarantee this right. Amnesty International Canada submitted that: (1) there is a right to habeas corpus in international law; (2) the entitlement to challenge detention extends to all contexts of detention, including administrative detention and therefore immigration detention; (3) the court responsible for habeas corpus reviews should be a different body from the one that initially ordered the detention; and (4) the right to habeas corpus is of particular relevance to stateless individuals due to their vulnerability to long-term administrative detention. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
The Supreme Court granted a leave to appeal on May 3, 2018. The Court heard the case on 14 November 2018, and the judgement was rendered on 10 May 2019.  
In their decision, the Court dismissed the Minister’s appeal and affirmed that there must be a complete, comprehensive, and expert scheme that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus when the legality of detention is being challenged in a habeas corpus application. The Court ruled that the statutory scheme in the IRPA does not meet this criterion, as IRPA proceedings do not provide for review as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus with respect to the bases upon which Mr. Chhina challenged his detention: the length, uncertain duration, and conditions of detention. Ultimately, the IRPA’s scheme is less advantageous to detainees in terms of the onus in detention review than a habeas corpus proceeding, the scope of review is narrower, and the remedy is less timely than that which would be provided by a habeas corpus application. For these reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

0,UN: Catastrophic failure as civilians ravaged by war violations 70 years after Geneva Conventions,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/un-catastrophic-failure-as-civilians-ravaged-by-war-violations-70-years-after-geneva-conventions/,"The UN Security Council must mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year by ending its catastrophic failure to protect millions of civilians around the world whose lives and livelihoods are routinely ravaged by violations of the laws of war, Amnesty International said today....","The UN Security Council must mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year by ending its catastrophic failure to protect millions of civilians around the world whose lives and livelihoods are routinely ravaged by violations of the laws of war, Amnesty International said today.
Tomorrow (23 May), the Security Council will hold an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict – 20 years after this goal was first added to its agenda.
“Twenty years after the UN Security Council pledged to do its utmost to protect civilians in armed conflict, and 70 years since the Geneva Conventions sought to shield civilians and others from the types of atrocities committed during the Second World War, the picture is incredibly grim,” said Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International.
“The great military powers cynically boast about ‘precision’ warfare and ‘surgical’ strikes that distinguish between fighters and civilians. But the reality on the ground is that civilians are routinely targeted where they live, work, study, worship and seek medical care. Parties to armed conflict unlawfully kill, maim and forcibly displace millions of civilians while world leaders shirk their responsibility and turn their backs on war crimes and immense suffering.
“Russia, China and the United States continue to abuse their veto power by blocking draft resolutions that aim to prevent or stop atrocities from taking place. Every time this happens, they are putting innocent people living in these danger zones at grave risk.”
In recent years alone, Amnesty International has documented a blatant disregard for civilian protection and international humanitarian law in armed conflicts where four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are parties – Russia, the USA, the UK and France. The fifth, China, has actively shielded neighbouring Myanmar as it carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly genocide.
The disastrous failure to protect civilians has been evident in the US-led Coalition’s blitzing of Raqqa, Syria, that left more than 1,600 civilians dead; in Russian and Syrian forces’ wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure and lives in Aleppo, Idlib and elsewhere – forcing mass displacement of millions and amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity; and in the war in Yemen where the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led coalition, backed by Western arms, has killed  and injured thousands of civilians in unlawful attacks and fuelled one of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
Somalia remains another of the world’s worst human rights and humanitarian crises. All parties to the conflict, including the USA, have violated both international human rights and humanitarian law. Despite ramping up air strikes in its secretive war in Somalia over the past two years, the USA failed to admit a single civilian casualty until an Amnesty International investigation prompted it to.
Israel has repeatedly targeted civilians and civilian objects during military operations in Gaza since 2008, causing great destruction and loss of human life. Between March 2018 and March 2019, Israel used lethal force against Palestinian protesters, killing at least 195 people, including medics, journalists, and children. Palestinian armed groups have fired indiscriminate rockets into civilian neighbourhoods in Israel, causing several fatalities.
In South Sudan and elsewhere, conflict-related sexual violence and gender-based violence are occurring at shocking levels. Witnesses and victims of a brutal government-led offensive in April-July 2018 in the north of the country described how civilians, including women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities were deliberately killed by gunfire, burnt alive in their homes, hung from trees and rafters and run over with armoured vehicles. Civilians were hunted down while fleeing into nearby wetlands, or rivers, as soldiers shot indiscriminately into areas where people were hiding and carried out attacks on islands where they had sought refuge.
The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported a record high number of civilian casualties in 2018, with 10,993 people killed or injured
Just last week, in Libya, Amnesty International documented how a fresh offensive on Tripoli has been marked by indiscriminate attacks and assaults putting the lives of civilians, including vulnerable detained refugees and migrants, at risk.
Nor is the record of the United Nations itself unblemished. In South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and elsewhere, UN peacekeepers have failed, on multiple occasions, to protect civilians facing deadly violence. A particularly reprehensible problem is that of sexual exploitation and abuse, with civilian women and girls being raped and assaulted by the very peacekeepers who are supposed to protect them.
Especially vulnerable people like children, older persons and persons with disabilities have also been targeted in particular ways in conflict – such as militaries and armed groups recruiting child soldiers or brutally assaulting those less able to flee during attacks on civilian populations.
Despite international treaties prohibiting their use, some states and armed groups continue to use inherently indiscriminate weapons like cluster munitions and landmines, which have been banned under international law for their impact on civilians. Others, such as Syria and Sudan have also used chemical weapons, which have no place in warfare.
Last year, the UN Refugee Agency decried the record-breaking figure of 68.5 million people displaced worldwide by armed conflict and other forms of violence.
“Seventy years on from the Geneva Conventions, to have almost 70 million human beings displaced by wars and other violence reflects the catastrophic failure of world leaders to protect them,” said Tirana Hassan.
“World leaders have all but abandoned civilians to the ravages of war. This week’s open debate in the Security Council must yield more than just posturing and empty promises. Concrete action is needed to reverse course, effectively protect civilians, stop war crimes and end impunity.”

“Some of the measures adopted or proposed by this government over the past five months raise many concerns,” said Jurema Werneck. “They could increase the risk of homicides with firearms. They legitimise a public security policy based on the use of lethal force. They violate the rights of indigenous peoples and Quilombolas. They base drug policy on punitive and ineffective practices. They could increase monitoring of NGOs without justification. They deny victims of the military regime the right to truth, justice and reparations. All of this is accompanied by an overtly anti-human-rights rhetoric which only adds to Amnesty International’s concerns about the human rights situation in Brazil.”
Erika Guevera-Rosas said: “It is an extremely delicate time in the Americas, with governments that, instead of protecting the human rights of the people in their countries, are promoting measures and policies that have devastating effects on those people (the Central Americans in need of protection in the United States, for example), or promoting violence and persecuting their opponents, as is happening in Venezuela and Nicaragua. In the past few months, we have seen how this regressive trend is affecting Brazil, with President Bolsonaro’s government taking some worrying stances.” 
“In 2017, Amnesty International showed that Brazil was one of the most dangerous countries in the Americas for human rights defenders, and Global Witness revealed that it was the riskiest in the world for defenders of human rights relating to land or the environment. President Jair Bolsonaro must take urgent measures to turn the situation around, comply with the international treaties Brazil has ratified, guarantee freedom of action for people and organisations working to creating a better society in the country, and abandon his anti-human-rights rhetoric, which legitimises violations against certain groups.”
Erika Guevara-Rosas, is worried by the shrinking space for civil society across the world, with the adoption of many laws seeking to control or hamper the work of non-governmental organisations.
“Unfortunately, more and more countries are trying to control non-governmental organisations and to hinder the work of organisations that play a crucial role in drawing attention to errors, crimes and human rights violations committed by the state. We are concerned that the measures taken by the current Brazilian government on the monitoring of NGOs are steps in that same direction,” said Beltrán. “The international community will continue to keep a close eye on Bolsonaro and his government’s compliance with their obligation to protect and guarantee human rights”.
This measure, like many others, comes in the context of a toxic, overtly anti-human-rights rhetoric. Erika Guevara-Rosas added: “Recently, we have seen political leaders in many countries campaigning with an overtly anti-human-rights agenda and rhetoric. In Brazil, this rhetoric is beginning to be turned into concrete actions. We therefore urge Bolsonaro to adopt firm and decisive measures to protect and guarantee human rights throughout the country and to ensure that the people who defend and campaign for such rights can do so without fear of reprisals”.

“The authorities in Indonesia must let people demonstrate freely and peacefully. Security forces must refrain from using unnecessary or excessive force or intimidating demonstrators,” said Amnesty International Indonesia’s Executive Director Usman Hamid.
Prior to the announcement by the Election Commission (KPU)  tomorrow, civil society organizations and prominent opposition political activists have announced plans to stage mass protests in Jakarta on 22 May, saying they would reject the 17th April presidential election results.
On Sunday 19 May, media reported that police were intimidating groups travelling on busses to Jakarta,  instructing them to turn back and not join the rally.
“Preventing people from joining a peaceful protest is a violation of their human rights. Everyone has the right to join others and express their thoughts peacefully,” Usman Hamid added.
Amnesty International Indonesia also urges the Indonesian government not to involve the military in the handling of public assemblies, since they are neither trained nor equipped to handle such situations which are completely alien to their mandate and fighting mission. If – exceptionally – they are to be deployed they must be fully trained and equipped to fulfil this task in compliance with international human rights law and standards, especially the “protect life” principle,  be subject to the same rules as regular police and, and should be placed under the oversight/command of a civilian authority.
Background
The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (Basic Principles) which were adopted domestically in Indonesia by a Chief of National Police’s Regulation (Perkap No.1/2009) clearly establish that law enforcement officials can use force only if non-violent means are unlikely to be effective.In the use of force, law enforcement officials must seek to minimize harm and injury.The Basic Principles require that in the dispersal of peaceful assemblies which are unlawful under domestic legislation law enforcement officials must exercise utmost restraint.
In any case, priority must be given to voluntary dispersal without the use of force, and if force has to be used, it needs to be necessary and proportionate to the level of resistance by the demonstrators; force that is likely to cause harm should be directed only at those individuals who are engaged in violence, and force with indiscriminate effects can only be justified in cases of widespread violence against persons, when it is no longer possible to contain the violence by dealing only with the individuals engaged in violence.

0,Mexico: First known child death in Mexican migration custody under new president suggests eerie parallels with US policy,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/mexico-first-known-child-death-in-mexican-migration-custody-under-new-president-suggests-eerie-parallels-with-us-policy/,"The first known death of a child detained by Mexican migration authorities under the current presidential administration is a sickening tragedy that demands answers from a government that promised to be more humane to migrants and refugees, said Amnesty International today. “At a time when...","The first known death of a child detained by Mexican migration authorities under the current presidential administration is a sickening tragedy that demands answers from a government that promised to be more humane to migrants and refugees, said Amnesty International today.
“At a time when children are dying in United States migration custody on the other side of the border, President López Obrador’s government is overseeing a crackdown on migrants and refugees that is resulting in the careless treatment of human lives. This suggests an alarming parallel with the current approach of the Trump government,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
On 16 May, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) announced that a 10-year-old Guatemalan girl died in hospital, where she was transferred after arriving at Mexico City’s migration detention centre in the company of her mother two days earlier, complaining of a sore throat. INM had brought her back from the northern border state of Chihuahua via bus, a trip of nearly 20 hours.
Amnesty International has documented at length the grave risks migrants and asylum-seekers are already facing along the US-Mexico border due to the policies of the US and the acquiescence of Mexico.  For its part, on 29 January, the US government commenced the “Remain in Mexico” policy, also known as the “migrant protection protocols”, under which US authorities have forcibly returned thousands of asylum seekers to Mexico while they await the final adjudication of their asylum claims in the USA. This policy violates international refugee law. The Mexican government did not refuse to cooperate with this policy.
Hundreds of people who are still waiting in Mexico for their court hearings in the United States on their asylum proceedings are stuck in legal limbo – and potentially dangerous situations. Chihuahua is one of the states where hundreds of asylum seekers are being forced to wait under this policy. In addition to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, US and Mexican authorities are also forcing asylum seekers to wait for weeks or months on an illegal asylum waitlist before allowing them to request protection, which some said has put them in danger.
In April 2019, Amnesty International met with Mexican municipal, state and federal agencies in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, who confirmed that the Mexican government had not provided any significant funding or coordinated relief efforts for the thousands of asylum seekers who are returned to Mexico. Border areas in Chihuahua state such as Ciudad Juárez are currently experiencing a high number of migrants and asylum seekers without significant additional resources from Mexican authorities to provide for their adequate shelter and care.
The INM has a responsibility to inform as to whether this 10-year-old girl was apprehended by Mexican migration agents in this border area, as well as other circumstances surrounding her detention that ultimately ended in her death. 
According to Mexican government data, 31,675 foreigners were placed in migration detention centres between January and March 2019, including 8,569 children under 18. In this same period, Mexican authorities have deported 22,614 people back to their countries of origin, 5,997 of whom were under 18.
Mexico’s laws on children’s rights expressly prohibit authorities from holding children in migration detention centres. Nevertheless, INM detains thousands of children on a yearly basis. The majority come from Central American countries such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, which in recent years has been experiencing high levels of violence that have forced many people to leave in search of protection.
Based on the information available to Amnesty International during the last five to ten years, deaths of children in immigration detention in Mexico are extremely rare.

The DCO regime violates the rights of refugee protection claimants to a fair hearing by imposing shorter timelines and other measures for no reason other than the claimant’s country of origin. Furthermore, delays in accessing the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) for claimants from DCO countries have been found to be unconstitutional.
In March 2019, the Federal Court struck down the distinction between the DCO and non-DCO claimants’ access to the PRRA. While DCO claimants were ineligible to apply for a PRRA for 36 months from the date of rejection of their claims, non-DCO refugee claimants were ineligible for 12 months after rejection of their claims. This difference in treatment was considered unconstitutional. Similarly, in July 2015, the Federal Court found that differential treatment in accessing the Refugee Appeal Division between DCO and non-DCO claimants was contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
“On multiple occasions, the DCO has been recognized by the courts for what it is: a discriminatory and arbitrary measure which disadvantages certain refugee protection claimants on the basis of nothing other than country of origin,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “UN human rights bodies have also criticized these measures. We are pleased to see that the government is now doing the same, and has further acknowledged that it was an unjust and misguided policy measure.”
Amnesty International had opposed the introduction of the DCO regime into the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2012 as discriminatory and arbitrary. Amnesty International was doubly concerned that a number of countries included on the list faced situations of widespread and very serious human rights violations, including Mexico and the situation of the Roma community in a number of designated Central European countries. UN human rights bodies had repeatedly called on Canada to repeal the DCO measures.
In today’s announcement, the government further signalled its intention to repeal the DCO regime through legislative amendment. “The government must now finish the job by repealing DCO provisions from the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,” Neve added.
Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, said the following: “today’s decision will meaningfully advance the equality of treatment that must exist for all people seeking Canada’s protection. However, the parallel between today’s decision, which advances that equality, and the ineligibility measure that is contemplated by Bill C-97, which undermines it, is impossible to miss. Not unlike the DCO regime, the ineligibility criteria introduced by Bill C-97 is both entirely subjective and arbitrary. We hope that the government will acknowledge the discriminatory nature of the measure that is proposed in Bill C-97 and withdraw this amendment.”

While both men and women politicians face online abuse, women politicians face abuse that is often gendered due to their political participation. Women from religious and ethnic minorities, transwomen, queer women, and Dalit women are further targeted due to their marginalized status.
“Online abuse silences women – it leads to self-censorship, limiting what women post, or leads to them leaving Twitter altogether”, said Reena Tete, Manager, Gender and Identity, Amnesty India. “It also has a strong negative impact on mental well-being and perceptions of offline safety.”
However, the exact nature and scale of abuse in the Indian context is under-researched. This project seeks to build an evidence base on the extent and nature of online abuse faced by prominent women politicians in India and its effect on their freedom of expression.
This project will engage 2000 Decoders drawn from across the country to analyse thousands of tweets before, during and after elections. In 2017, Amnesty International conducted Troll Patrol in eight countries including the US and the UK where it found that 7.1% or 1.1 million tweets sent to women across political spectrum were “problematic” or “abusive”. In light of this, Amnesty International recommended Twitter to usher in more transparency by putting out disaggregated data on the categories of abuse reported by women and the nature of Twitter’s response to such abuse. This project seeks to apply the same methodology to examine tweets in India.
 “Twitter is an important online space for women to express themselves. And all efforts must be taken to prevent the spread of toxicity, hate and violence against women on the platform”, said Reena Tete.
Troll Patrol India has been launched with a call for engaging volunteers for the decoding project here: https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol-india

“These latest arrests have reignited a climate of fear amongst independent activists and human rights organizations about a renewed assault by the Egyptian authorities on the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. 
“The Egyptian authorities have an appalling record of arbitrarily detaining peaceful activists over unfounded charges for months and sometimes for years, without ever referring them to trial, before releasing them under harsh probation measures. Instead of stepping up their repression with a fresh round of arbitrary detentions, the authorities should stop harassing peaceful critics and ensure all those detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association or assembly are immediately and unconditionally released.”
Amnesty International is calling on the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Mostafa Maher and Haytham Mohamdeen as their detention is arbitrary, and the charge against them is overly vague and has no credible basis. They appear to have been targeted solely because of their history of peaceful activism. The authorities also violated their fair trial rights during arrest, detention and questioning.  
Background
On 13 May, Haytham Mohamdeen was summoned to Saf police station, in Giza governate, south of Cairo, after being wrongfully accused of violating his probation terms. When he went to the police station, the police arrested him and held him without access to his lawyer or family until 16 May. Haytham Mohamdeen had been under probation since his release on 30 October 2018 from five months of arbitrary  detention over trumped up charges of inciting peaceful protests against austerity measures.
On 14 May, plainclothes police forces went to Mostafa Maher’s house in Qatameya, Cairo and arrested him, without showing an arrest warrant. The authorities kept him in incommunicado detention until 16 May.
On 16 May, prosecutors from the Supreme State Security Prosecution ordered the detention of both men for 15 days on the charge of “aiding a terrorist group in achieving its goals”. They were not able to meet with their lawyers ahead of the interrogation and Haytham was interrogated without a lawyer.

An analysis of...","A contemptible amendment to Iran’s code of criminal procedure could effectively strip detainees who are facing punishments such as the death penalty, life imprisonment and amputation, of the right to access a lawyer while they are under investigation, said Amnesty International.
An analysis of the bill published by the organization today details how, if passed, the amended law would permit the prosecution to immediately deprive individuals arrested on “national security” and certain other serious criminal charges of access to a lawyer for 20 days, which could be extended to cover the whole investigation phase. In Iran, those charged with “national security” offences include human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents targeted solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights.
“This is a regressive piece of draft legislation which would effectively remove the right to a lawyer in a wide range of criminal investigations and contravene Iran’s obligations under international law. If passed by MPs it would be a crushing blow to Iran’s already deeply defective justice system and could further consolidate patterns of torture and other ill-treatment against detainees to extract forced confessions during interrogations,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at ‎Amnesty International.
“Denial of prompt access to a lawyer is a serious violation of the right to a fair trial in all circumstances, but it is particularly shocking in cases where individuals are at risk of being sentenced to severe or irreversible punishments such as execution, amputation and life imprisonment.”
For decades Iranian authorities have failed to ensure that the right to access a lawyer is respected, particularly during the investigation phase.
The proposed amendment is intended to replace an already flawed provision in the Note to Article 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This provision requires individuals facing charges related to “national security” and certain organized crimes to select their lawyer from a list of names approved by the head of the judiciary.
Iranian lawmakers involved with the legal and judicial parliamentary commission had announced in June 2018 that they would look into reforming this law to grant detainees access to a lawyer of their choosing, but instead they have taken a huge step backwards.
“Iranian lawmakers should focus their attention on introducing legal reforms that would strengthen rather than further undermine the right to a fair trial. The Iranian parliament must urgently revise this proposed amendment to bring it into line with Iran’s obligations under international human rights law and guarantee the right of all detainees to access a lawyer of their choice from the time of arrest and at all stages of judicial proceedings, including pre-trial detention, questioning and investigation,” said Philip Luther.
 Background
Iran’s legal and judicial parliamentary commission announced on 6 May 2019 that it had a prepared a draft amendment to the Note to Article 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which came into force in its current form in 2015.
The proposed amendment is expected to be scheduled for a vote in Iran’s parliament in the coming weeks.

“Taiwan has today made history in the fight for equality for LGBTI people. Love has won over hate, and equality has won over discrimination. This is a moment to cherish and celebrate, but it has been a long and arduous campaign for Taiwan to become the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
“We hope this landmark vote will generate waves across Asia and offer a much-needed boost in the struggle for equality for LGBTI people in the region.
“We are filled with pride and joy that from next Friday same-sex couples in Taiwan will be able to marry and finally have their love and relationships recognized as equal under the law. But the Taiwanese government must not stop here; it needs to act to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identities and intersex status.”
Background
On 17 May, Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan voted in majority to pass the draft law called “The Enforcement Act of the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748”. The law is due to take effect on 24 May 2019.
Under the new law, same-sex couples are granted the same right to legally marry as opposite-sex couples, and many of the same rights and obligations applied to opposite-sex couples under the existing regulations in the Civil Code will be applied to same-sex couples.
However, the law falls short of genuine and full marriage equality in some areas. For example, it does not provide equal adoption rights for same-sex couples. The law only allows spouses in same-sex marriages to adopt the biological children of their partners, but not joint adoption of non-biological children, as permitted for opposite-sex married couples.
In May 2017, Taiwan’s Constitutional Court ruled that the existing law covering marriage discriminated against same-sex couples. The court gave the legislature two years to amend existing laws or pass new legislation to legalize same-sex unions.
After the government submitted the now adopted proposal, two “compromise” same-sex union bills granting lesser rights by legalizing “cohabitation” or “partnership” were proposed by anti-LGBTI groups and politicians and submitted to the parliament for adoption. The two bills were rejected.
Amnesty International believes that the human rights to dignity and equality require that marriage rights for same-sex couples are guaranteed on the same basis and with all the same rights as marriages between couples of opposite sex.

Amnesty International issued UA 47/19 to support him.

Bayram was released on April 29 April.

Amnesty International recognizes that lesbian, gay, transgender, queer, and two-spirit (LGBTQ2S), Indigenous, Black, and other people of colour in Canada and around the world disproportionately experience human rights violations perpetrated by the police, state actors, and non-state actors because of systems of oppression.
State and police violence against LGBTQ2S, Indigenous, Black, and other people of colour violate the right to life; the rights to liberty and security of the person; the right to safety and to live free from violence  and discrimination; the rights to protest, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and peaceful assembly; and the right to live free from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the uprising against state and police violence led by transgender women activists, many of whom were Black or people of colour, and some of whom were sex workers. The Stonewall riots mobilized LGBTQ2S people against police harassment and brutality in New York City and are now celebrated worldwide as a cornerstone of the liberation movements for LGBTQ2S communities, leading to the founding of the first Pride marches.
Pride is fundamentally about the liberation of LGBTQ2S people and intentionally including people who have been disenfranchised and pushed to the margins of society. The intention and spirit of Pride must be to prioritize the inclusion and safety of the most marginalized LGBTQ2S people over the inclusion of institutions that violate the human rights of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colour.
Many sex workers are LGBTQ2S, Indigenous, Black, and/or people of colour. Canada’s laws on sex work—which is the exchange of sex between consenting adults for remuneration—place sex workers in isolated and unsafe situations where they are at a heightened risk of harassment and violence. Police are tasked with enforcing those sex work laws which threaten the safety of sex workers. Amnesty International advocates for the protection of the rights of sex workers and calls for the repeal of the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, which criminalizes many aspects of sex work.
As a human rights organization, Amnesty International recognizes the diversity of LGBTQ2S communities. We support the rights of communities to peacefully protest police violence, including the right to decide whether or how to include police participation in Pride festivals.
We encourage Amnesty International members and supporters to make their own decisions about whether to participate in Pride festivals that include police participation.
We recognize that Pride is not the only place to recognize and raise concerns about police violence against marginalized groups, nor is it the only place to show support for LGBTQ2S communities.
To that end, Amnesty International is committed to building on our efforts to address police violence in Canada, and supporting communities pressing for the rights of marginalized groups across the country to be respected, protected, and upheld.

“El Salvador’s legislators cannot turn their backs on the victims of crimes under international law and grave human rights violations committed during the armed conflict. The Salvadoran authorities are obliged to bring to justice anyone suspected of being responsible for the extrajudicial executions, torture and enforced disappearances that took place during the armed conflict. To do otherwise would risk becoming complicit in heinous crimes.”
“If the legislators approve a new law that grants amnesty and guarantees impunity for human rights violations, far from ensuring the victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparation, they would be mocking their pain and trampling on their rights. It is unacceptable that in El Salvador, almost 30 years after the signing of the Peace Accords, attempts are still being made to allow those responsible for the crimes committed in the armed conflict to escape justice and enjoy impunity.”
Additional information:
According to the United Nations Truth Commission, more than 75,000 people were tortured, extrajudicially executed or forcibly disappeared during the internal armed conflict in El Salvador between 1980 and 1992.
The Salvadoran army was responsible for many massacres in communities accused of supporting guerrilla groups. Armed opposition groups also committed crimes under international law and human rights abuses.
Five days after the United Nations Truth Commission published its recommendations in 1993, the Salvadoran authorities passed an Amnesty Law that contravenes the country’s obligations under international law and is an affront to the thousands of victims of human rights abuses and their families.
In 2016, the Supreme Court of El Salvador declared the Amnesty Law unconstitutional in a long-awaited and historic ruling.

“The absence of basic requirements of a fair trial – such as having access to a lawyer – strips today’s verdict of any reliability or credibility.
“The eight men were held in solitary confinement for over a year – this in itself can amount to torture. They were also denied access to their lawyers from the beginning of the trial; a number of the men claimed they had been tortured to sign so-called confessions but there have been no investigations into these claims. These details leave us with no confidence in the process that led to the conviction of the three men.
“It is welcome news that five men were acquitted; however, the authorities must now effectively investigate allegations of torture and quash the unreliable convictions of the remaining three. If there is not sufficient evidence against them and they cannot be prosecuted fairly, they too should be acquitted and released.”
“The flagrant disregard for human rights in this case is incongruous with the global image of a state-of-the-art, open and inclusive state that the authorities in the UAE seek to project.”
Background:
The eight Lebanese citizens were detained in the UAE between December 2017 and February 2018. They lived and worked in UAE for more than 15 years, seven of them worked with Emirates Airline.
All have been held in solitary confinement, charged with terrorism-related offences, and denied access to legal representation. A number of them have reported having been tortured in order to sign “confessions,” which they were not allowed to read. The charges they face include “forming a terrorist cell” and planning “terrorist” attacks in the UAE on orders of Hezbollah, a Shi’a political party and armed group based in Lebanon.

In June last year, one of my colleagues at Amnesty International received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number. It contained details about a protest supposedly taking place at the Saudi embassy in Washington DC, and my colleague was instantly suspicious. The message came at a time when Amnesty International was campaigning for the release of six jailed activists in Saudi Arabia, and something didn’t feel right.
An analysis of the links in the message proved these suspicions to be well-founded. Amnesty’s Tech team found that clicking the link would have secretly installed potent spyware on the phone, obtaining total access to calls, messages, photos and GPS location. A closer look enabled us to trace the attack back to a secretive Israeli company: NSO Group.
NSO Group sells surveillance software to governments and has been linked to digital attacks on human rights activists all over the world. The attempt to spy on Amnesty was the final straw for us. Today I am providing evidence to support 30 plaintiffs taking legal action in Israel, petitioning the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to revoke NSO’s export license. As I have set out in an affidavit to the court, NSO’s software is a threat to activists and journalists all over the world. Digital rights group Citizen Lab has linked the company to attacks against civil society in Bahrein, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We cannot sit back and watch while NSO becomes a go-to for repressive governments.
Like many previously documented attacks, the message sent to Amnesty had all the hallmarks of Pegasus, a dystopian piece of NSO software which can gain control of a phone’s keypad, camera and microphone. Pegasus was the tool used to track Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati human rights defender who is currently serving a ten-year jail sentence. Citizen Lab has also exposed Pegasus’s role in a spyware scheme targeting Mexican activists and journalists, including those investigating corruption and drug cartels.
It’s worth reiterating here that NSO itself states it only sells to governments. But governments, of course, are not necessarily more benign than cyber criminals, and some are significantly worse. By now, NSO surely knows what kind of hands its products end up in.
Last year the company came under new scrutiny following allegations its software was used to track murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi – an accusation the company has denied. But despite the ever-growing pool of evidence, the Israeli government has continued to give NSO the green light to export its products. Specific details of how the export licencing works and what kind of security or ethics checks it entails are difficult to find. The process is shrouded in secrecy; but it is clearly not stringent enough to keep NSO’s products out of the hands of human rights abusers. We don’t know if NSO has been used by the Israeli government in the context of surveillance of Palestinians.
The Israeli MoD has ignored multiple requests from Amnesty and others to revoke the company’s license, which is why we’re providing evidence in this legal action.
If the world’s largest human rights organization, which has technology experts among its staff, can be targeted, it’s probably the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NSO’s reach. Attacks like the one on Amnesty also show just how brazen the international surveillance industry has become. Earlier this year, Citizen Lab researchers looking into NSO were reportedly targeted by private operatives, in what seemed to be an attempt to silence and intimidate them.
But this case also is about more than human rights work – it highlights the threat to privacy for all of us. Today it was reported that a vulnerability in WhatsApp could expose billions of users to attacks by NSO spyware. Amnesty has not yet been able to verify these reports but if true they exemplify fully our claim to the Israeli courts: NSO has gone rogue and the Israeli MoD holds no proper oversight, control or regulation.
While NSO is allowed to market and sell its products without proper oversight, it’s essentially growing into a private international intelligence agency guided solely by profit and seemingly accountable to no one. Its spyware is so potent that most people would never know if their phone or computer had been infected.
NSO has repeatedly denied that Pegasus has been misused to target human rights defenders. Since a change of ownership in February this year the company has been trying to clean up its image, buying Google search ads and launching a new website where it claims to take “a pioneering approach to applying rigorous, ethical standards to everything we do.” No further details are provided, which hardly lends credibility to the claims. For those whose safety is jeopardized by NSO’s reckless sales, this kind of platitudes isn’t enough. Our petition today is a first step which we hope will eventually put a stop to NSO’s web of global surveillance.

It restricts the ability to farm their land, attend a protest, improve their homes, raise families, travel for medical purposes, or access essential services such as electricity and clean water. 
A Palestinian prisoner’s experience is even more dire: they must not only withstand all the above, but also arbitrary detention from Israeli and Palestinian forces, cruel and unlawful treatment, the repression of fundamental human rights, and the ongoing unlawful detention of children. 
For both, life is made all the more insufferable by Israel’s ever-expanding settlement operation. 
Palestinians in the occupied territories are subject to military law, which excludes the most fundamental human rights – such as the right to legal counsel during interrogation – while Israeli settlers enjoy the protections of Israeli civil law. 
Administrative detention allows Israeli authorities to arbitrarily detain prisoners without providing reasons for arrest, delay their trials for six months and then renew their detentions indefinitely without charge. At the end of 2018, over 5,500 Palestinian prisoners remained in Israeli prisons, including nearly 500 administrative detainees. 
Documented detention conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons include cruel and unlawful punishment, such as the deprivation of family visits and disallowing detained mothers to hold their children. 
On April 17, 2017, Palestinian prisoners launched a mass hunger strike to protest their conditions and historic ill treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities. A relative of one prisoner testified, “The Israeli authorities play with our emotions, they torture and punish us.” 
It is not only the Israeli authorities who subject the Palestinian people to such violations. The Palestinian Authority habitually detains Palestinians in an attempt to repress freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and social justice organizing. One Ramallah-based NGO reported that Palestinian authorities attacked media freedom 77 times during 2018, often through arbitrary arrests and physical assault. 
This abuse of power is reinforced by Israeli Military Order 101, enabling Israeli authorities to regularly imprison or fine Palestinians for peaceful expression of political dissent. This dual-sided censorship is intended to crush all forms of political engagement and strip Palestinians of their fundamental right to peaceful assembly. 
One example is the case of Issa Amro. Founder of the Youth Against Settlements and the “Open Shuhada Street” campaign, Issa has spoken at the United Nations about his peaceful efforts to stand against Israel’s military rule, demanding an end to Israel’s settlements in the city of Hebron and other places in the occupied West Bank. 
Despite international recognition, he is routinely punished and faces criminal charges. Issa stated: “I have been arrested more times than I can count for non-violent human rights work.” On March 28, 2019, Issa was again detained, this time for criticizing the Palestinian government in a Facebook post. 
Palestinians need to be able to stand up for their rights without the threat of imprisonment, and the world needs to know what is happening to them. It can’t happen without activists like Issa. The charges against him and other human rights defenders like him must be dropped. 
Despite ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child nearly 30 years ago, Israeli forces routinely detain children and subject them to degrading treatment. Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have endured the fear, intimidation, physical violence and humiliation that occurs during arrest. 
Israel prosecutes up to 700 Palestinian children via the military court system annually. According to Defense for Children International – Palestine, 96% of the children prosecuted between 2013-2018 did not have family present during interrogations. They arrive at interrogations blindfolded and sleep-deprived, and their confessions are often made after verbal and physical abuse – the likes of which often amount to torture. 
Because these children live under Israeli military law, the common act of stone-throwing is a criminal offense – for which Israel arrested over 200 children as of October 2018. 
Palestinians who build or improve their homes without difficult-to-obtain permits face jail time as well. For the Hashimeh brothers, who built an addition on their childhood home in Wadi Qadoum, there were only two options: demolish the home they built for themselves, or watch Israel demolish their home, and face jail time and punitive fines for failing to demolish it themselves. 
These restrictive Israeli policies on home construction in East Jerusalem are part of a wider two-tiered discriminatory Israeli plan aimed at solidifying a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, and are directly responsible for countless arbitrary arrests. 
This systemic dispossession of land, power, and human rights is enough to lead communities to despair, and Palestinian children whose homes have been demolished to make way for Israeli settlers experience depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and sleep disruption. 
The compounded effects of displacement and dispossession of land, coupled with the constant threat of arbitrary detention, forces Palestinians to live an unendurable situation.   
Over 600,000 Israelis settlers have occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank alone, resulting in the more than 50,000 demolished Palestinian homes and the restricted movement of nearly 5 million people. In 2017, Israel committed to accelerating its expansion of settlements, causing a recent United Nations Forum to discuss the threat of de facto annexation. 
The Israeli settlement operation is recognized as illegal under international law, yet only those standing against it suffer imprisonment. 
The international community must not only speak up for the rights of the occupied, but stand against those who profit from occupation. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, the Canadian government and Canadian companies contribute to – and profit from – their maintenance, development and expansion, which amount to war crimes under international criminal law. This acquiescence normalizes and legitimizes to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation. 
Amnesty International calls upon the international community to sign petitions to stop enabling illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The petitions can be found here: Occupation at 50 and Destination: Occupation.

Over 600,000 Israelis settlers have occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank alone, resulting in the more than 50,000 demolished Palestinian homes and the restricted movement of nearly 5 million people. In 2017, Israel committed to accelerating its expansion of settlements, causing a recent United Nations Forum to discuss the threat of de facto annexation. 
The Israeli settlement operation is recognized as illegal under international law, yet only those standing against it suffer imprisonment. 
The international community must not only speak up for the rights of the occupied, but stand against those who profit from occupation. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, the Canadian government and Canadian companies contribute to – and profit from – their maintenance, development and expansion, which amount to war crimes under international criminal law. This acquiescence normalizes and legitimizes to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation. 
Amnesty International calls upon the international community to sign petitions to stop enabling illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The petitions can be found here: Occupation at 50 and Destination: Occupation.

“While this promises to be a first step towards holding al-Bashir accountable for his heinous crimes, the Sudan authorities must hand him over to the International Criminal Court to answer charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Al-Bashir must face justice not only for recent crimes, but also for the crimes under international law he allegedly committed while he was in power.
“This announcement is all the more significant coming off the back of yet another night of bloody violence in Sudan during which at least four people were killed, and about 90 sustained gunshot injuries. The prosecutor must also investigate and charge everyone else responsible for the continued use of excessive lethal force against peaceful protestors.
“It should not be forgotten that the Sudan Transitional Military Council also bears responsibility for failing to protect peaceful protestors. They must hold to account any security officer who fired live bullets on the protestors camped out at the military headquarters and in other parts of the country.”
Background
At around midday on 13 May uniformed security officers were captured on a widely circulated social media video whipping protestors. The onslaught escalated from around 6pm when live shots were fired resulting in at least four deaths, one of whom was a military officer, and more than 90 people injured, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. The doctors said they had also treated 40 injuries arising from whipping and suffocation by tear gas.

In the past year, Saudi Arabian activists, including several women human rights defenders, have suffered the terrible ordeal of arbitrary detention, unable to speak to or see their loved ones for long months and with no access to legal representation. Women activists also detailed accounts of their torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse to the court, and many of them now face a prison term for their peaceful activism and speech.  
“Today marks a year of shame for Saudi Arabia. A year ago, the authorities started locking up some of Saudi Arabia’s bravest women activists, instead of celebrating hand in hand steps that should have served to advance the rights of women in the country,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
“Then they went on to detain those who still dared to stand up for these women, advocate for women’s rights in the country, or even express any questioning of the authorities’ policies.”
Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, Saudi Arabia’s leading women’s rights campaigners, were detained on 15 May 2018 and have been facing trial for their human rights work since March 2019.
While Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef were amongst seven women provisionally released in the past two months, Loujain al-Hathloul and several other women activists remain in prison. Women human rights defenders, Nassima al-Sada and Samar Badawi, have been detained since July 2018 without charge with tens of other fellow activists. In April 2019, the authorities escalated their crackdown on critics, arbitrarily detaining at least 14 journalists, writers, academics and family members of women’s rights defenders.
In November 2018, Amnesty International revealed reports of torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse of at least 10 activists arbitrarily detained since May 2018, which included several women human rights defenders. The organization called on the authorities to allow independent monitors access to detained activists.
“This is also a shameful day for Saudi Arabia’s closest allies in the West, namely the USA, the UK and France. Instead of prioritising business deals and arms sales, they should be intransigent – and publicly so – in pressuring the Saudi Arabian authorities for the immediate and unconditional release of all individuals who are being punished for expressing their views peacefully,” said Lynn Maalouf.
A few months following the wave of arrests targeting women’s rights activists, the Saudi Arabian authorities escalated their crackdown on dissent, as manifested in the Public Prosecution’s calls for the execution of religious clerics and Shi’a activists on trial before the counter-terror court for charges related to exercising their peaceful rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. This includes prominent religious cleric Sheikh Salman al-Awda, who was accused of 37 charges, including his affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood and calls for government reforms.
In late April 2019, the authorities also carried out a mass execution of 37 men, the majority of them from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority and executed after unfair trials. At least 15 men executed last month were sentenced to death based on “confessions” they said were extracted through torture, including a young man who was convicted of a crime that allegedly took place while he was under the age of 18.
In 2019 alone, the Saudi authorities have executed at least 110 people.
Background:
On the first anniversary of the arrests, Amnesty International repeats its call on supporters worldwide to continue taking action for the detained activists until they are unconditionally free.
Over the past year, over 280,000 people have stood in solidarity with Saudi Arabia’s women human rights defenders and activists through signing petitions and writing to the Saudi Arabian authorities demanding their release.
On Wednesday 15 May, Amnesty International UK and the Saudi Arabia-focused campaign organization ALQST are hosting an event to mark one year since the group of women’s rights activists were arrested. For more details, please contact: www.amnesty.org.uk/amnesty-media-team

“The Sri Lankan authorities must protect the country’s Muslim minority as it is being targeted by mobs in horrific attacks on their homes, mosques and businesses in the wake of the Easter Sunday massacre. The authorities must take steps to promote unity in diversity against the forces of hatred, those promoting fear and violence, and pitting communities against each other.
“The authorities must put the protection of human rights at the heart of its response and prevent further violence, including holding the suspected perpetrators of earlier attacks accountable. In particular, prosecutions must also meet international fair trial standards.
“It is alarming to see reports that those suspected to be involved in the March 2018 anti-Muslim violence may have been involved in these recent attacks as well.
“These attacks did not emerge out of a vacuum. There were clear signs that a backlash against Muslims was underway and the authorities could have acted on reports of threats earlier, potentially preventing much of the violence over recent days.”
Background
On 21 April, more than 250 people were killed and hundreds injured when bombers from a local Islamist armed group affiliated to the so-called Islamic State targeted three churches and three hotels on Easter Sunday.
Despite heightened security measures in the country, including intermittent bans on social media and a discriminatory ban on face-veils, there have been frequent reports of anti-Muslim attacks in many parts in the country.
On 13 May, the government imposed a countrywide curfew following reports of widespread attacks against Muslim-owned businesses, homes and mosques. Amith Weerasinghe who has been arrested on 14 May in connection to the attacks was also one of the people previously arrested, and later released on bail in 2018 for his role in anti-Muslim attacks in Digana.

By Grand Chief Dr. Abel Bosum and Alex Neve
In 2010, former prime minister Stephen Harper publicly reversed his government’s opposition to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In a formal “statement of support,” the Harper government said that it had listened to Indigenous leaders in Canada and “learned from the experience of other countries” and was now “confident” that Canada could move ahead with implementation of the Declaration “in a manner that is consistent with our Constitution and legal framework.”
So why wouldn’t Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators support legislation intended to finally move ahead with the work of implementing the Declaration in Canada?
Bill C-262 is the private member’s bill introduced by NDP MP Romeo Saganash. Passage of C-262 would create a legal framework requiring the federal government to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples on the measures needed to bring Canadian law and policy into line with the minimum global standards set out in the Declaration. 
Critically, passage of the Bill C-262 would not suddenly change the legal status of the Declaration in Canada. Courts would continue to use the Declaration in the interpretation of Canada, just as they are already doing. However, passage of C-262 would establish an ongoing process of federal implementation that could not be easily abandoned by future governments.
The Bill enjoys widespread support. Out of 71 witnesses who appeared before a Parliamentary Committee examining the Bill last year, only one opposed adoption of C-262. 
Yet, when it came to a vote in the House of Commons, Conservative MPs refused to join the other parties in supporting the Bill. Video widely circulated online even showed Conservative MPs giving each other a high five after they voted against the Bill.
Now the Bill is before the Senate where its fate will be decided. The Bill is being sponsored in the Senate by independent Senator Murray Sinclair. The support of the former Chief Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a powerful symbol that the Bill is an opportunity to advance reconciliation in Canada. Unfortunately, however, the limited time remaining to adopt C-262 before the current session ends means that even a small minority opposing the Bill could threaten its passage into law.  
A number of Conservative Senators have already gone on the record opposing the Bill. Their main concern seems to be that the UN Declaration could have far-reaching and unpredictable impacts in Canada. Some have already used procedural tactics to attempt to stall debate over the Bill.
These Senators seem to forget that the Declaration is not new – that it was developed over a period of more than twenty years and adopted by the United Nations more than a decade ago. They also seem to forget that a Conservative government studied the Declaration and came to the conclusion that it could and should support its implementation. And they are clearly ignoring the fact that the very purpose of the Bill is to ensure ongoing dialogue between government and Indigenous peoples over how the Declaration will be interpreted and applied in the future.
With an election looming, we are at a point where every issue on Parliament is seen as an opportunity to score points over political opponents. The cause of reconciliation, however, must not be dragged down by partisan politics. 
Bill C-262 is something that every federal party could and should support. In doing so, they have an opportunity to send a clear message to the public about the importance they place on reconciliation.

RE: Ending Sex Discrimination in the Indian Act
Dear Minister Bennett,
On April 12, 2019, the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls took the unique step of issuing a statement prior to issuing its Final Report. The statement called on the Government of Canada to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the 2019 federal election to end sex discrimination in the Indian Act. The Commissioners stated that “The gendered discrimination over decades has disenfranchised women from their communities, broken up families, and caused great disparity in rights and benefits as between First Nation women and men.” The National Inquiry statement echoed the same call made by First Nations women leaders on April 9, 2019 in Ottawa.
As Parties with Standing to the National Inquiry, and organizations and individuals who have been closely following the National Inquiry’s work, we are writing now to urge you to respond swiftly and immediately to this first recommendation from the National Inquiry by bringing the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the upcoming federal election. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women have all identified sex discrimination in the Indian Act as a root cause of the violence that First Nations women, girls, and two-spirit people experience.
The UN Human Rights Committee ruled in January 2019 that the sex-based hierarchy between s. 6(1)(a) and s. 6(1)(c), introduced by the 1985 Indian Act, and continued by the amendments of 2011 and 2017, violates the right to the equal protection of the law without discrimination based on sex, and violates the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of Indigenous culture, guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the National Inquiry said in its statement “Indigenous women are independent right-holders and Canada should uphold their rights.” Recognizing Indigenous women as equal in dignity and rights is a threshold requirement for moving forward to end the crisis of violence.
This ruling from the UN Human Rights Committee comes as a result of almost fifty years of struggle by First Nation women to be recognized as equal in law. Jeannette Corbiere Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Sandra Lovelace-Nicholas, Sharon McIvor, Dr. Lynn Gehl have all fought for equality for Indigenous women in the registration provisions of the Indian Act; it is surely time for Canada to recognize this right.
On May 3, 31 organizations and a prominent academic wrote to you requesting an official response to the National Inquiry’s final report before the House of Commons rises in June. We call on you, as a key part of this official response, to take action to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before June 21. This action by your Government will show that you intend to treat seriously the National Inquiry’s recommendations. It will demonstrate to people in Canada, and especially to Indigenous women, that they have value in the eyes of your Government and are worthy of the dignity and respect that equal rights in law convey. It will empower Indigenous women in their own struggle to stop the violence.
We urge you to respond swiftly to the National Inquiry’s report by ending the sex discrimination in the Indian Act, and bringing the outstanding sections of Bill S-3 into force before the election.
